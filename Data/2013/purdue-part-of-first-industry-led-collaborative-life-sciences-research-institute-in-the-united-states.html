<h2>Purdue part of first industry-led collaborative life sciences research institute in the United States</h2>
<div id="video-embed"><videoembed/></div>
<FirstPhoto/>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. &#8212;Indiana Governor Mike Pence joined
Indiana-based global life sciences and research university executives Thursday
(May 30) to unveil the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, the first
industry-led collaborative life sciences research institute in the country.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The Indiana Biosciences Research Institute is a statewide
public-private partnership advanced by BioCrossroads and led by Indiana's life
sciences industry, with support from the state of Indiana and partnerships with
Indiana's research universities to discover, develop and deliver biosciences
innovations in Indiana. The Institute will serve as the centerpiece project of
the BioCrossroads public-private collaboration through its attraction of
world-class scientific leaders and life sciences research dollars to Indiana,
while focusing on human health solutions for improving the lives of Hoosiers
and people around the world. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Indiana has built a life sciences ecosystem unlike
any other state and faces a new season of opportunity as a result," said Gov.
Pence. "The Institute will strengthen Indiana's reputation as a global
life sciences hub and produce breakthroughs that will attract new investment to
our state and create good-paying jobs for Hoosiers."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The Indiana Biosciences Research Institute is the result
of leadership from industry executives from Eli Lilly and Co., Dow
AgroSciences, Roche Diagnostics, Cook Medical, Indiana University Health and
Biomet and the Governor of Indiana, with active support in initial development
by BioCrossroads. Indiana's research institutions, including Indiana
University, Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame also are
participating in the development process. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Bringing together Indiana's bioscience industry
leaders and leading research universities is of critical importance to our state,
our nation and our world," said Richard O. Buckius, Purdue's vice president
for research. "The Indiana Biosciences Research Institute will serve as a
catalyst in the further development of these key partnerships, will help speed
commercialization opportunities and will enhance Purdue University's world-class
research capabilities in solving many of today's most complex life science
issues."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">David Johnson, president and CEO of BioCrossroads said, "This
Institute comes at a pivotal time in our state's evolution as a global life
sciences leader. With a bioscience sector that now contributes more than $50
billion a year to the Hoosier economy, Indiana is ranked by BIO and Battelle as
one of the top five states in the nation in terms of our total number of life
sciences companies and employees. Through the Institute, BioCrossroads believes
we have found a bold way to raise our game in Indiana by building the platform
that will truly take us to the next level of success." </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The Indiana Biosciences Research Institute is developing a
novel operating model, with industry providing a major source of funding and
defining the Institute's research focus to optimize commercialization
opportunities. The Institute also draws on a life sciences industry cluster
that is one of the largest and most diverse in the nation, with global
companies that are developing next-generation drugs and pharmaceuticals,
diagnostics tests, medical devices, cell-based therapies, agricultural
biotechnology and animal health and production solutions. This diversity of
industry capabilities creates opportunities for Indiana-based life sciences
companies to work in collaboration &#8211; not competition &#8211; toward common scientific
discoveries. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"The research institute will change the bio-landscape
of our region," said Bart Peterson, senior vice president at Eli Lilly and
Co. "Indiana's life sciences companies spend billions of dollars in
research and development each year to advance health-care innovations for
improved human health. The Institute will help us nurture our partnerships
across the country and develop more intellectual capital here in Indiana -
allowing us to keep more research dollars in the state, attract more federal
research funds, and draw top scientific minds to feed our research pipeline and
local economies." </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Having the best talent and the best scientific minds
is crucial for growing our life sciences industry cluster in Indiana,"
said Steve Ferguson, chairman of Cook Group, which is celebrating its 50th
anniversary this year. "World-class scientific talent at the industry and
academic level is one of the state's most powerful economic development tools.
Just as companies like Lilly and Cook Medical started as small, entrepreneurial
operations, we expect the Institute to draw the best and the brightest to
Indiana to further deepen our life sciences industry roots and grow more
business opportunities."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">As part of the Institute development process, industry
leaders have defined common scientific interests for research and discovery.
The Institute will initially focus on the most pressing global and local
interrelated human health issues: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and
nutrition. These interrelated metabolic disorders are a major economic burden
and a leading cause of death in the United States. Risk factors, such as high
blood pressure and insulin resistance, allow for early disease detection, and
timely preventive actions, such as through improved nutrition, and early intervention
can slow or prevent the onset of disease. This is an important scientific
discovery subject for the approximately 35 percent of Americans who suffer from
cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders, and is a significant risk for
Hoosiers who suffer disproportionally from these diseases. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"We have an opportunity to not only help millions of
people around the world who are battling these metabolic disorders, but we can
have significant impact on Hoosiers who suffer more than the average American
from diabetes and who rank 8th in the nation in terms of obesity," said
Jack Phillips, president and CEO of Roche Diagnostics. "The Indiana
Biosciences Research Institute will provide the platform to deliver significant
scientific advancements that could improve Hoosier lives."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"The ability to better understand metabolic disorders
impacts the work of nearly every life sciences company in Indiana," said
Antonio Galindez, president and CEO of Dow AgroSciences. "Together, we can
develop a deeper understanding of the pathways leading to metabolic disease and
apply those discoveries to not only medical interventions, but also to greatly
enhanced nutritional sources developed through advanced crop improvement
technologies and other advancements in human health." </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Patients and clinicians have much to gain by the
success of this critically important new venture," said Daniel F. Evans
Jr., president and CEO of Indiana University Health. "The discoveries and
inventions generated by the Institute will be used by our physicians to care
for patients. To accelerate the pace of innovation from lab bench to patient
bedside, we are pleased to make our health-care system available to researchers
to test potential new treatments and therapies."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The estimated $360-million Indiana Biosciences Research
Institute is a nonprofit entity that is anticipated to be supported largely by
corporate and philanthropic funding with oversight from a largely donor-based board
of directors representing the life sciences industry, the state of Indiana,
academia and nonprofit donors. The State of Indiana has appropriated $25
million for the biennium for start-up costs. An additional $25 million in
start-up funding is being sought from industry and philanthropic sources, which
will be used in part to recruit a nationally recognized CEO and research
fellows. The remaining capital funding will be sought from corporate and
philanthropic sources, and ongoing operating costs will be funded through
Institute endowment proceeds, industry-sponsored research and federally funded
research.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The Indiana Biosciences Research Institute will attract
local and national scientific leaders beginning with the CEO and the
recruitment of research "Indiana Fellows." These research fellows
will lead teams of scientists and partner with industry and universities on
research projects. These teams will consist of experts across a spectrum of
competencies, including bioengineering, bioinformatics, nanotechnology and
agriculture. These cross-functional teams will share resources and research
laboratories at the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute
and will work onsite at industry and research university labs with academic and
industry scientists.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"As the scientific discovery process increases in
complexity, more companies are looking outside their own walls for
multi-disciplined team members to help move innovation forward, at a faster
rate, in order to remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace,"
said Jon Serbousek, president, Biomet Biologics.&#160; "A cross-industry, statewide partnership
focused on commercially translatable innovation on the cutting edge of basic
and clinical science will help the state's life sciences industry move to the
next level."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"The Indiana Biosciences Research Institute provides
a new and exciting opportunity for our research universities to work with our
statewide life sciences industry," said Bill Stephan, vice president for
engagement at Indiana University. "The Institute will bolster our ongoing
efforts to recruit highly regarded local and national researchers and graduate
students. We envision the dynamic of researchers from the Indiana Biosciences
Research Institute working alongside researchers in industry or university
labs, strengthening long-term collaborative research and funding opportunities."</p>
