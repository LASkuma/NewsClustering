<p class="FORMAT-BODY">WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. &#8211; U.S. researchers are 
perfecting simulations that show a nuclear weapon's performance in 
precise molecular detail, tools that are becoming critical for national 
defense because international treaties forbid the detonation of nuclear 
test weapons.&#160; </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The simulations must be operated on 
supercomputers containing thousands of processors, but doing so has 
posed reliability and accuracy problems, said <a href="http://www.ece.purdue.edu/%7Esbagchi" target="_self">Saurabh Bagchi</a>, an associate professor in Purdue University's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Now researchers at Purdue and high-performance 
computing experts at the National Nuclear Security Administration's 
(NNSA) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have solved several 
problems hindering the use of the ultra-precise simulations. NNSA is the
 quasi-independent agency within the U.S. Department of Energy that 
oversees the nation's nuclear security activities.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The simulations, which are needed to more 
efficiently certify nuclear weapons, may require 100,000 machines, a 
level of complexity that is essential to accurately show molecular-scale
 reactions taking place over milliseconds, or thousandths of a second. 
The same types of simulations also could be used in areas such as 
climate modeling and studying the dynamic changes in a protein's shape. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Such highly complex jobs must be split into many 
processes that execute in parallel on separate machines in large 
computer clusters, Bagchi said.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Due to natural faults in the execution 
environment there is a high likelihood that some processing element will
 have an error during the application's execution, resulting in 
corrupted memory or failed communication between machines," Bagchi said.
 "There are bottlenecks in terms of communication and computation."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">These errors are compounded as long as the 
simulation continues to run before the glitch is detected and may cause 
simulations to stall or crash altogether.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"We are particularly concerned with errors that 
corrupt data silently, possibly generating incorrect results with no 
indication that the error has occurred," said Bronis R. de Supinski, 
co-leader of the ASC Application Development Environment Performance 
Team at Lawrence Livermore. "Errors that significantly reduce system 
performance are also a major concern since the systems on which the 
simulations run are very expensive."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Advanced Simulation and Computing is the 
computational arm of NNSA's Stockpile Stewardship Program, which ensures
 the safety, security and reliability of the nation's nuclear deterrent 
without underground testing.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">New findings will be detailed in a paper to be 
presented during the Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on 
Dependable Systems and Networks from June 25-28 in Boston. Recent 
research findings were detailed in two papers last year, one presented 
during the IEEE Supercomputing Conference and the other during the 
International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed 
Computing. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The researchers have developed automated methods to detect a glitch soon after it occurs.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"You want the system to automatically pinpoint 
when and in what machine the error took place and also the part of the 
code that was involved," Bagchi said. "Then, a developer can come in, 
look at it and fix the problem."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">One bottleneck arises from the fact that data are streaming to a central server.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Streaming data to a central server works fine 
for a hundred machines, but it can't keep up when you are streaming data
 from a thousand machines," said Purdue doctoral student Ignacio Laguna,
 who worked with Lawrence Livermore computer scientists. "We've 
eliminated this central brain, so we no longer have that bottleneck."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Each machine in the supercomputer cluster 
contains several cores, or processors, and each core might run one 
"process" during simulations. The researchers created an automated 
method for "clustering," or grouping the large number of processes into a
 smaller number of "equivalence classes" with similar traits. Grouping 
the processes into equivalence classes makes it possible to quickly 
detect and pinpoint problems.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"The recent breakthrough was to be able to scale up the clustering so that it works with a large supercomputer," Bagchi said.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Lawrence Livermore computer scientist Todd Gamblin came up with the scalable clustering approach. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">A lingering bottleneck in using the simulations 
is related to a procedure called checkpointing, or periodically storing 
data to prevent its loss in case a machine or application crashes. The 
information is saved in a file called a checkpoint and stored in a 
parallel system distant from the machines on which the application runs.
 </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"The problem is that when you scale up to 10,000 
machines, this parallel file system bogs down," Bagchi said. "It's about
 10 times too much activity for the system to handle, and this mismatch 
will just become worse because we are continuing to create faster and 
faster&#160; computers." </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Doctoral student Tanzima Zerin and Rudolf 
Eigenmann, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, along 
with Bagchi, led work to develop a method for compressing the 
checkpoints, similar to the compression of data for images.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"We're beginning to solve the checkpointing problem," Bagchi said. "It's not completely solved, but we are getting there."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The checkpointing bottleneck must be solved in 
order for researchers to create supercomputers capable of "exascale 
computing," or 1,000 quadrillion operations per second.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"It's the Holy Grail of supercomputing," Bagchi said.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The research has been funded by Lawrence 
Livermore and the National Science Foundation. The work also involves 
Lawrence Livermore scientists Greg Bronevetsky, Dong H. Ahn, Martin 
Schulz and IBM Austin researcher Mootaz Elnozahy.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Laguna was awarded a George Michael Memorial High
 Performance Computing Fellowship during the Supercomputing 2011 
Conference in recognition of his work on the project. The Supercomputing
 Conference paper can be accessed online at IEEExplore or ACM Digital 
Library or from the research group's home page at <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl">https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl</a></p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Purdue researchers did not work with the actual 
classified nuclear weapons software code, but instead used generic 
benchmarks, a set of programs designed to help evaluate the performance 
of parallel supercomputers.</p>

<p class="Abstract-TITLE"><strong>Automatic Fault Characterization via Abnormality-Enhanced Classification </strong></p>
<p class="Abstract-AUTHORS"><em>Greg Bronevetsky, Ignacio Laguna, Saurabh Bagchi, and Bronis R. de Supinski </em></p>
<p class="Abstract-TEXT">Enterprise
 and high-performance computing systems are growing extremely large and 
complex, employing many processors and diverse software/hardware stacks 
[1]. As these machines grow in scale, faults become more frequent and 
system complexity makes it difficult to detect and diagnose them. The 
difficulty is particularly large for faults that degrade system 
performance or cause erratic behavior but do not cause outright crashes.
 The cost of these errors is high since they significantly reduce system
 productivity, both initially and by time required to resolve them. 
Current system management techniques [2], [3] do not work well since 
they require manual examination of system behavior and do not identify 
root causes. When a fault is manifested, system administrators need 
timely notification about the type of fault, the time period in which it
 occurred and the processor on which it originated. Statistical modeling
 approaches can accurately characterize normal and abnormal system 
behavior [4]. However, the complex effects of system faults are less 
amenable to these techniques. This paper demonstrates that the 
complexity of system faults makes traditional classification and 
clustering algorithms inadequate for characterizing them. We design 
novel techniques that combine classification algorithms with information
 on the abnormality of application behavior to improve detection and 
characterization accuracy significantly. Our experiments demonstrate 
that our techniques can detect and characterize faults with 85% 
accuracy, compared to just 12% accuracy for direct applications of 
traditional techniques.</p>
