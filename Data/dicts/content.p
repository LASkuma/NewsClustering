aS' august rains give relief to indiana drought still far from over west lafayette ind drought continued to ease in southwest indiana in the past week as that area of the state hit hardest by the summer s drought benefited from august rains an update of the u s  drought monitor on thursday aug 23 showed some areas of southwest indiana that had been in exceptional drought the highest level of dryness for several weeks improved to extreme drought still far from full recovery but improving  there was some slight improvement in central indiana which was in less critical levels of dryness from significant rainfall indiana has been getting this month   most of the improvement in the drought status this past week was in the southwest said ken scheeringa associate state climatologist based at purdue university   elsewhere there s not a lot of change from a week ago scheeringa noted that august rainfall to date in indiana has averaged near 3 1 inches 20 percent above normal  since the start of this year state average rainfall is about 20 1 inches rainfall deficits so far range from 5 8 inches across northern indiana to 11 5 inches in the far southwest  the forecast for the remainder of august was for less than normal rainfall but above normal precipitation in the first week of september scheeringa said  temperatures were expected to be above normal through the period the uncertainty of the rainfall pattern in the coming months will be compounded by land falling tropical cyclones and their tracks said dev niyogi state climatologist   another challenge we have is to try to balance the drought designation based on the rains that will occur versus the longer term impacts that are already under way he said  the drought monitor map of indiana is available at http droughtmonitor unl edu dm_state htm in mw weekly gis maps of indiana rainfall can be found at http iclimate org precip images precip asp a compilation of purdue extension drought resources is available at http www purdue edu drought  '

aS' august rains rejuvenate drought stressed soybean crop soybean plants typically are waist high by the end of august but drought limited the height of plants according to shaun casteel an assistant professor of agronomy at purdue  although these plants just west of the purdue campus in tippecanoe county are only knee high to casteel their height doesn t necessarily translate into reduced yields  casteel an extension soybean specialist is optimistic that late season rains could increase yield levels purdue agricultural communication photo tom campbell  download photo west lafayette ind july and august rains have come just in time to preserve some of the yield potential of much of indiana s drought stressed soybean crop and more was on the way as the remnants of hurricane isaac moved north from the gulf coast  while the season long drought has not yet ended rains and a letup in record setting heat have combined to rejuvenate the crop so much that soybean farmers in some areas of the state could still see trend or more normal yields purdue extension agronomist shaun casteel said  but rain from isaac over the long labor day holiday weekend might not be such a good thing for the crop which could be damaged by flooded fields and wind  rainfall amounts were forecast from 2 inches in the far north of the state to 7 5 inches in the south according to the indiana state climate office based at purdue university   we could see some standing water in areas of the state that have been getting rain where soil moisture has been replenished casteel said   soybeans in areas of the state that haven t had much rain can still benefit from this weekend s rain provided it is not excessive   most soybean plants are shorter than normal this year so wind would not be as much of a factor as it would have been in other years  but as soybeans have recovered from drought stress some have elongated internodes or the distance between trifoliate leaves and heavy pod production on the upper two thirds of the plants  those top heavy plants would be most at risk for lodging or stalk damage from strong winds casteel said in its august crop production report the u s  department of agriculture projected that indiana soybean yields would average 37 bushels per acre down 24 percent from the trend prediction of 48 7  but those estimates were based on crop conditions as of aug 1 and if steady rainfall continues casteel said there s a chance growers could make up some of the difference   late july and early august rains have helped soybeans retain pods and more recent rains have helped the plants fill pods casteel said   at this point in the growing season we re keeping an eye on seed size the average size of indiana soybean seeds is 3 000 seeds per pound  but as it rains casteel said that number from this year s drought damaged crop could notch closer to 2 500 per pound short plant sizes have alarmed many growers this season but smaller plants don t necessarily equate to smaller yields   plant stature isn t a driving factor in soybean yields casteel said what s more important is having plenty of leaf area in a more normal crop soybean plants would have 5 6 times as much leaf area as ground area but good yields can be obtained with leaf area that is only four times the ground area   casteel was quick to point out that conditions vary by region the u s drought monitor update of thursday aug 30 for example showed that most of the improvement in conditions was in northeast indiana where the drought was downgraded from severe to moderate the second level of dryness  but some counties in southeast indiana near cincinnati deteriorated to extreme drought the second highest level there really have been three drought scenarios in indiana this year he said   some areas have been dry all season long some were dry early but then had timely rains and other areas started out with rain but dried off late   in the southwestern portion of the state farmers have experienced exceptional drought throughout much of the season and still might not see much potential to preserve yield at this point  in parts of the state that started out dry but then got timely rains soybeans are progressing well this is especially true in the north central and the northeast  the southeast had rain early but then dried off pod retention has been a problem in those areas growers who do have soybeans to harvest will be able to take advantage of extremely high prices  soybean futures for november 2012 and january 2013 are hovering around 17 per bushel that s up nearly 6 per bushel from the november 2011 futures  with prices that high casteel said growers need to be doing yield estimates for grain marketing he also said it s important for farmers to inspect plants for bean leaf beetles  the insect emerged earlier and at higher populations after a mild winter which gave it time to produce a second generation that could now damage soybean yields   we need to be out in the fields looking for bean leaf beetles feeding on pods not leaves he said treatment thresholds are going to be lower this year because soybean prices are so high   more information about estimating soybean yields and bean leaf beetle is available in the aug 24 issue of purdue extension s pest and crop newsletter at http extension entm purdue edu pestcrop 2012 issue22 index html'

purdue is among 10 award winners for 2012 selected out of 354 nominations from higher education institutions worldwide  the winners are highlighted on campustechnology com and will be featured at the magazine s campus technology 2012 conference july 16 19 in boston and in its july print edition  gerry mccartney purdue s vice president for information technology chief information officer and olga oesterle england professor of information technology says it organizations have reached a point where they must become innovators instead of builders and purdue s mobile applications result from that mindset   we have been able to make the transition from builders to innovators at purdue not just because we have many smart and creative people that s true of nearly every university campus but because we ve been able to create an environment focused on innovation mccartney says   for example when we released hotseat our classroom discussion tool we had our own ideas about how a faculty member might use it  but we ve found that faculty are using it to engage students in ways that never occurred to us when people invest their own creativity into a technology to make it better that s a great sign that the technology truly is innovative   hotseat uses student comments and a twitter like forum to enhance classroom discussion suddenly every student can comment in class and may do so without interrupting the lecture s flow  mixable connects students to their classmates by allowing them to create online study groups and share class materials automatically and securely on facebook  doubletake is a mobile video system that allows students to capture share and watch videos from virtually anywhere using their smartphones  the doubletake system also includes a web interface where videos can be uploaded in various formats and shared with others including instructors or the world  kyle bowen director of informatics the it team that created the applications says modern technology including mobile technology and social media is changing how business is done in almost every area   but before now classrooms have not benefited from these changes bowen says through partnering with creative faculty members purdue is developing a portfolio of technologies for classrooms that engage students and contribute to their success  we see this award as validation for the concept of technology s role in the classroom as well as recognition of the innovative work of the team   bowen says purdue is negotiating with mcgraw hill on a licensing agreement to deliver hotseat to the

discuss information provided by detection equipment at an instrumented intersection   the research aims to improve the safety and efficiency of traffic flow purdue news service file photo west lafayette ind purdue university engineers have worked with the city of lafayette ind   to create a new advanced transportation management system a network of sensors computers and software to efficiently control traffic signals and reduce congestion  the system is one of the first deployments in the country of new traffic signal management techniques developed at purdue said darcy bullock a professor of civil engineering and director of the joint transportation research program at purdue it allows engineers to attack traffic jams on two fronts determine more precisely how to adjust the length of green signals to better match traffic volumes and synchronize signals in series on busy roads so that motorists catch green lights in sequence   we have all been at intersections where the green light did not last long enough for all the traffic to pass through and then seen drivers on the opposing side of the intersection get too much green time bullock said   what we are doing enables electronic signal controllers to collect data that can be used to effectively alter this timing to better manage traffic flow   the ultimate goal is to allow the majority of the traveling public to spend less time stopped at a signal when it is red she said   other potential benefits are improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions because less time idling reduces fuel usage and the associated emissions  having fewer starts and stops also reduces fuel consumption and emissions the system is integrated into signal controllers that are widely used at intersections across the country and uses specialized software algorithms  data are displayed on a main computer in the city s traffic center allowing personnel to monitor information and make a change to individual intersection timing   it is like a dashboard for signal systems said neal carboneau implementation manager for the joint transportation research program   you could equate it to the leap from horse drawn carriages to commercial aircraft in the past you had to manually count vehicles and time their progression through the corridors  you d have to come back to the office and do calculations then return to the signal to make adjustments to improve the flows then in order to verify that the changes were effective you would need to go through the same procedure again  as you can imagine it was a very inefficient and time consuming process recent advances in technology including improvements to the reliability and speed of internet access as well as greater computer storage and processing ability have made it practical to use computerized systems that operate signals   induction loops in the pavement near signals indicate that a vehicle is in the turn lane and other locations these loops which are ubiquitous in u s  cities are connected to a computer in a cabinet at each intersection algorithms in the system use mathematical equations and data from the loops and other sensors to determine whether an intersection s traffic volume is exceeding its capacity tracking traffic during each cycle of green amber red  the resulting information is plotted on graphs that show how many vehicles are unable to get through an intersection before the signal turns red  such data enable the system to identify needed changes to signal timing to facilitate the flow of traffic and also to synchronize signals   how often have you driven down a corridor and had it go green green green green bullock asked the answer is not very often  the problem is that until now we have not had good measurement tools needed to create patterns of sequential green signals the system incorporates new traffic signal performance measures criteria based on research on traffic flow that enable computers to identify the need for signal timing optimization  the performance measures were developed at purdue in collaboration with the national cooperative highway research program and the indiana department of transportation  we ve married some theory with new data collection practices performance measures and modern it technology to come up with a better tool for making decisions about signal management bullock said  loop detectors are used in combination with the new algorithms to upgrade standard electronic controllers the brains of traffic signal systems at intersections   the system has been installed and is operational but since it is the first of its kind getting it to be fully functional will take some time said fred koning foreman in the lafayette traffic department  having a centralized system is helpful in troubleshooting the network which is made up of numerous signals and computers and a web of electrical cables and sensors koning said   several other states and local agencies across the country are considering modeling their system specifications based upon the system in lafayette carboneau said  the project has involved about a dozen purdue faculty staff and students from the school of civil engineering the indiana local technical assistance program supports research and helps transfer technology from research to implementation in line with purdue s strategic plan for discovery with delivery carboneau said   they were integral in their support of the research and facilitation of the dialogue between the city industry and purdue assisting in the system s development and operation   jay grossman a project engineer and others from elkhart county ind assisted the research and provided guidance in the development of specifications used in the procurement of the system  elhart county is in the process of bringing a similar system online recently receiving a merit award for the new system from the american council of engineering companies were miller koning and thomas vandenberg from the engineering firm butler fairman and seufert inc  previous research has been funded by the indiana department of transportation a portion of that earlier work on state road 37 in noblesville ind   yielded data indicating a potential 20 percent decrease in travel time for drivers findings from a recent report about the noblesville research show that optimizing signal timing resulted in an estimated annual cost savings of 472 817 with a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 197 tons per year showing the financial and environmental benefits of using systems and processes such as these   not only are there benefits in improving he efficiency of the local agency s personnel but there are also benefits that decrease the travel time vehicle cost and emissions of the traveling public carboneau said   '

aS' corn silage could salvage some value for drought damaged crop west lafayette ind farmers with drought damaged cornfields could consider harvesting the crop for livestock feed to salvage some of its value and to help livestock producers supplement short forage supplies says a purdue extension forage specialist  damaged corn can be harvested as either whole plant silage or green chop but either way growers and livestock producers need to be aware of how it can affect feed quality and animal health   feeding value of drought stressed corn is influenced by several factors but in general is higher than expected keith johnson said   most studies indicate feed value of drought stressed corn to be 80 100 percent that of normal silage purdue university studies showed little or no difference in feedlot gain or milk production when beef and dairy cattle were fed normal or stressed corn silage  but as a rule johnson said drought stressed corn will have slightly more fiber and less energy but 1 2 percent more protein than normal silage   ideally the crop should contain 60 70 percent moisture at harvest johnson said for upright silos to avoid seepage growers should harvest at 60 65 percent whereas for bunker silos harvesting at 65 70 percent moisture will result in better packing and storage qualities   he said producers often tend to harvest the damaged crop too soon meaning silage has too much moisture which can result in poor fermentation and ultimately lower feed value  stalks of plants with brown leaves and stalks with small ears or little grain content will be higher in moisture a quick way to determine if the plant contains too much moisture is to hand squeeze a representative sample collected from the forage chopper johnson said   if water drips from the squeezed sample the corn is too wet for ideal fermentation livestock producers using drought damaged corn for silage need to make sure they have the feed tested for nitrate  nitrate levels can be higher in drought damaged corn while the potential for nitrate toxicity after fermentation is recuded johnson said it s still a good idea to have the feed analyzed  producers with short pasture and stored feed supplies might also consider harvesting drought damaged corn as green chop there are two major concerns with this practice johnson said   one is the potential for nitrate toxicity and the second is the potential to founder animals animals with founder or laminitis have an inflammation of the soft tissue around the hoof bone that can cause permanent damage to the foot   feed green chop in small quantities throughout the day rather than large quantities once per day take extra precautions during the first 2 3 days following rain because nitrate levels tend to increase during this period   as plants mature nitrate levels decline so animals become acclimated and the chances for toxicity decrease over time johnson said  corn growers looking to sell drought damaged corn for silage and livestock producers looking to purchase it need to understand how to properly price the crop  because yield varies widely based on moisture content johnson said moisture content will greatly affect pricing before growers make any decisions about what to do with drought damaged corn johnson said it is imperative that they check with crop insurance agents so the crop can be appraised for damage prior to harvest  he also noted that herbicides and insecticides applied to the corn crop throughout the season have feeding restrictions growers need to pay close attention to herbicide and insecticide labels and be in touch with chemical suppliers to make sure the crop is harvested and fed safely  more information also is available in johnson s web based publication drought damaged corn as livestock feed available for free at http www ansc purdue edu beef hendrix droughtdamagedcorn html more information about the drought is available at purdue extension s website http www purdue edu drought writer jennifer stewart 765 494 6682 jsstewar purdue edusource keith johnson 765 494 4800 johnsonk purdue edu  '

aS' cover crops help retain nitrate prepare for future crops west lafayette ind drought decimated corn crops are likely to leave residual nitrate in soils after harvest making this year ideal for farmers to plant cover crops says a purdue extension agronomist  cover crops can scavenge residual nitrate and recycle it through biomass the process helps reduce nutrient loss through leaching and runoff and makes some of those nutrients available for the next cash crop   this year is a great example of when a cover crop is needed to trap the much larger amount of residual nitrate that will be present after the poor corn crop said eileen kladivko purdue university professor of agronomy   farmers who lose residual nitrogen also are losing the opportunity to trap that nitrogen and keep it in their fields for subsequent crop use   according to kladivko cover crops will benefit individual farms by building soil organic matter and potentially reducing next year s nitrogen application  the practice also benefits regional water quality although much of the midwest is still in drought rain has returned to many areas  with rainfall residual nitrate will leach out the bottom of the root zone along with other essential nutrients those nutrients end up in local waters and eventually in the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico  kladivko expects the amounts of nitrate lost to be much larger than usual this year she said numerous studies have shown the highest nitrate losses in drainage waters following dry years  cover crops also can help farmers recoup part of the nitrogen fertilizer they applied to fields this season and provide benefits for future growing seasons  poor cash crop yields equal less crop residue being returned to the soil cover crops can offset some of that loss by protecting against soil erosion and providing food for soil organisms  as the cover crops decompose during the next year some of the nitrate taken up will be released back into the soil for use by the next cash crop and some nitrate will help build soil organic matter  the amount of nitrate uptake this fall and the amount of release next season depends on several factors such as the amount of residual nitrate in the soil currently the type of cover crop the amount of growth this fall or spring if it s a winter hardy cover crop the stage of cover crop at termination time and the decomposition rate of the cover crop in the spring  while most farmers think of using cover crops after corn they also can be useful after soybeans as with cornfields cover crops can add organic material and trap nitrate released by decomposing soybean residues  although the amount of nitrate taken up by cover crops is difficult to predict kladivko said it could be 50 100 pounds of nitrate per acre in a drought year  the amount released to next year s crop also is hard to predict but it could potentially be up to half of the nitrate in the aboveground biomass if the cover crops are terminated while in the vegetative state and they have a low carbon to nitrogen ratio  kladivko recommended planting cover crops such as oats cereal rye annual ryegrass or oilseed radish if the primary objective is to scavenge nitrate and build organic soil matter  if producers want to do fall grazing she recommended planting turnips or crimson clover mixed with oats and cereal rye whichever cover crop is planted farmers need to plan for their future cash crop in the spring  planning for cover crop termination is essential if the additional crop is to be beneficial and not hinder the planting of the next crop  the midwest cover crops council has additional resources and tools to help farmers select and plant cover crops at their website  http www mccc msu edu '

university alumni and a professor are part of nasa s mars science laboratory mission which early this morning landed the curiosity rover on the planet s surface  purdue alumnus douglas adams nasa s mars science laboratory parachute cognizant engineer helped design build test and deliver the parachute decelerator system on the mars science laboratory or msl spacecraft  testing of the parachute which at 130 pounds is the largest ever used outside earth s atmosphere took place in the world s largest wind tunnel  the tunnel could hold a 737 jet but couldn t quite contain the parachute which peeked out one end of the tunnel adams said being next to something so massive that is moving so quickly gave me an understanding of how an ant must feel when a foot comes to step on it he said   the parachute had to be robust because it faced grueling conditions here on earth a parachute begins to slow an object as it is being deployed but on mars the entry vehicle hardly slowed at all until the parachute fully opened  it had to hold up to a very sudden onset of tremendous force artist s concept of mars science laboratory entry descent and landing   nasa jpl caltech download photo the parachute was designed to generate up to 65 000 pounds of drag force according to nasa s jet propulsion laboratory  adams also helped develop the mortar deployment system which he describes as basically an enormous cannon that shot out the parachute   the mortar had to fire very precisely as the spacecraft traveled at 900 mph and any delay of even a half a second would have had a significant effect on targeting he said   as with many of the various teams hardware and systems for msl if it had failed it could have ended the mission we only had one chance   adams said he nervously watched the data with other scientists at the jet propulsion laboratory during the landing event the tension in the room was palpable as every person there had invested a significant portion of their life in getting curiosity to mars he said   when the sky crane maneuver was completed and we got the tango delta nominal call for touchdown nominal the atmosphere changed to a chaos of jubilation  it was incredible a once in a lifetime experience adams is a low density supersonic decelerator parachute systems engineer and soil moisture active passive dynamics and systems engineer at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif  he earned his bachelor s master s and doctoral degrees at purdue in 1994 1996 and 2001 respectively purdue alumnus eugene bonfiglio a nasa mission design engineer in the entry descent and landing guidance and control system group helped test and prepare the on orbit contingency plan for the msl that would have been enacted if a launch failure left the spacecraft orbiting earth  bonfiglio helped determine ways to control the spacecraft s fall back to earth so that it would have landed safely in the pacific ocean  he also was involved in performing system tests that helped fine tune the software used to control the spacecraft during its entry descent and landing  prior to this mission most of bonfiglio s work was related to trajectory and navigation and involved computer simulations he said he is most looking forward to the measurements from msl s actual entry descent and landing   as hard as we try any testing that we do here on

degree in mechanical engineering in 1996 and a doctoral degree in 2002 in aeronautics and astronautics both from purdue  steve schneider a purdue professor of aeronautics and astronautics evaluated the heat shield that protected the msl spacecraft when it entered the martian atmosphere  the heat shield is the largest ever built for a mars mission schneider was on a review board for the thermal protection system  input from the review led to a change in the heat shield material he said the heat generated on entry depends on the weight of an object relative to its size and this was the largest heaviest probe ever landed on mars schneider said   this heat shield faced a very different scenario from past missions and its engineering was quite complicated this was the first mars mission to use a heat shield made from pica which can handle a much higher temperature than previously used materials   as the msl plowed through the atmosphere of mars which is 100 times thinner than that of earth the heat shield was estimated to reach 2 900 degrees fahrenheit according to the jet propulsion laboratory  the curiosity mars rover will function as a mobile laboratory to investigate the current and past environment of mars gale crater to determine if it is or ever was capable of supporting life  it is equipped with 10 science instruments and a robotic arm that can drill into rocks scoop up soil and deliver samples to internal analytical instruments  more information about the mission is available at http mars jpl nasa gov msl '

aS' cutting livestock greenhouse gases requires effort from rich and poor countries west lafayette ind regulating livestock greenhouse gas emissions could shift livestock production to unregulated less developed countries unless those poorer nations can be enticed to preserve their forested lands according to a purdue university economic study  agriculture and deforestation account for about one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions with methane from livestock production being the most important type of farm related emission  alla golub a purdue research economist at the center for global trade analysis in purdue s department of agricultural economics thomas hertel a purdue distinguished professor of agricultural economics and executive director of the global trade analysis project and benjamin henderson livestock policy officer at food and agriculture organization of united nations modeled policies aimed at reducing emissions from livestock   emissions from agriculture have not gotten as much attention as those from fossil fuels combustion but when the world gets serious about tackling climate policy livestock will be an important part of that discussion hertel said   livestock sectors are the most important contributors to non co2 greenhouse gas emissions and would be seriously affected if a tax or regulations were implemented   their findings with co authors from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations the electric power research institute and ohio state university were published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences they showed that wealthy countries alone would have limited success in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production because it would give poorer countries with greater greenhouse gas emissions intensities an incentive to expand production   in this case we would likely see continued expansion of pasture and cropping area in regions like south america as agriculture encroaches on forested lands golub said   this negates greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the wealthy countries this led golub hertel and their co authors to examine what might happen if emission regulations in wealthy countries were paired with incentives to retain forested land in poorer nations  without new grazing areas those poorer countries would not expand their livestock production as much indeed this combination of policies is quite effective at preventing emissions leakage to developing countries while enhancing forest carbon stocks in the lower income regions hertel said  the effect however would be less meat available for consumption in the poorer countries and a price increase globally just like a fossil fuel emissions tax would raise prices for energy this would have an impact on agricultural prices hertel said  this unwanted impact on livestock consumption and production in poorer countries could be reduced by designing an appropriate policy the authors found  their study shows that wealthier countries could provide a subsidy that requires poorer countries to protect forested lands and shift to cleaner technologies which would support those countries output and consumption while reducing emissions  purdue s global trade analysis project model was used for the study the food and agriculture organization provided funding for the research  alla a golub benjamin b henderson thomas w hertel pierre j gerber steven k rose and brent sohngen recent research has shed light on the cost effective contribution that agriculture can make to global greenhouse gas abatement however the resulting impacts on agricultural production producer livelihoods and food security remain largely unexplored  this paper provides an integrated assessment of the linkages between land based climate policies development and food security with a particular emphasis on abatement opportunities and impacts in the livestock sector  targeting annex i countries and exempting non annex i countries from land based carbon policies on equity or food security grounds may result in significant leakage rates for livestock production and agriculture as a whole  we find that such leakage can be eliminated by supplying forest carbon sequestration incentives to non annex i countries furthermore substantial additional global agricultural abatement can be attained by extending a greenhouse gas emissions tax to non annex i agricultural producers while compensating them for their additional tax expenses  because of their relatively large emissions intensities and limited abatement possibilities ruminant meat producers face the greatest market adjustments to land based climate policies  we also evaluate the impacts of climate policies on livelihoods and food consumption in developing countries in the absence of non annex i abatement policies these impacts are modest  however strong income and food consumption impacts surface because of higher food costs after forest carbon sequestration is promoted at a global scale  food consumption among unskilled labor households falls but rises for the representative farm households because global agricultural supplies are restricted and farm prices rise sharply in the face of inelastic food demands   '

aS' deboer farmland property taxes to continue rising into 2015 west lafayette ind farmland owners are in for more property tax increases at least into 2015 purdue extension agricultural economist larry deboer says  in the jan 27 issue of his column capital comments deboer said the base rate for the assessment of an acre of farmland will jump from 1 290 in 2011 to 1 500 in 2012  he estimates the base rate will be about 2 030 per acre by 2015 the 2007 base rate was 880 indiana farmland is assessed based on its use value rather than its market value a practice not uncommon among other states  for example farmland that borders commercial or residential development is not assessed based on selling price but rather only on the income it can earn from farming deboer said  when determining property taxes the government uses a formula that takes into account the base rate productivity factor and influence factor  the productivity factor is based on soil productivity for growing corn subtracted from that for some acreage is an influence factor which is a percentage reduction in the dollar amount based on conditions such as frequent flooding grade or forest cover  changes in the assessed value come into play because of the way the base rate is calculated each year indiana s assessed values change each year based on several factors including land rents commodity prices costs and interest rates  increasing land rents high commodity prices and low interest rates have combined to create a trend of increase that means the base rate for 2011 was based on figures from the years 2002 07  the base rate for 2012 was calculated from the years 2003 08 because corn and soybean prices in 2002 were relatively low and interest rates were high those numbers combined to help keep the average lower in 2011 s assessments  now the numbers from 2002 have been replaced with the high commodity prices and lower interest rates of 2008 resulting in an increase in assessed value   here s where a new quirk in the formula comes in the department of local government finance drops the highest value of the six from the average deboer said   the general assembly changed the formula for 2011 taxes to make the increases in the base rate a little smaller for 2011 taxes lawmakers dropped the highest value derived from the 2007 data  but because the 2008 data is higher it will be dropped leaving the still high values of 2007 to factor into the 2012 tax assessments   without dropping the highest value the base rate for 2012 taxes would have been 1 670 deboer said the calculation change reduced the base rate by about 10 percent   because there is a four year lag in the formula and all of the data from 2009 and 2010 and most from 2011 are available deboer said it is possible to project what will happen to the base rate for the next few years  the department of local government finance used data from 2004 2009 for the 2013 calculation of 1 630 deboer said because commodity prices have remained high and interest rates low the base rate for taxes in 2014 will be about 1 760  for taxes in 2015 it will be about 2 030 the six year average and four year lag also mean the high commodity prices and low interest rates in 2012 will first enter the tax formula in 2016 and will not drop out until 2022   the base rate is likely to increase and remain high for a long long time deboer said deboer s full column along with the podcast version are available on the web at http www ag purdue edu agcomm pages newscolumns aspx source larry deboer 765 494 4314 ldeboer purdue edu'

aS' digital badges show students skills along with degree passport a new classroom app created by purdue university allows instructors and advisers to give students digital badges to indicate mastery of skills  the application uses mozilla s open badge infrastructure and is available for use by instructors at any institution purdue university image  download photo west lafayette ind digital badges icons that represent academic achievements or skills smaller than a college degree are an increasingly popular way for universities to acknowledge the breadth of student learning  now purdue university has developed a pair of mobile apps that make creating awarding and displaying badges much easier the apps available online are called passport and passport profile a video explaining how passport works is available on youtube kyle bowen director of informatics in information technology at purdue says badges are an exciting new concept that is being adopted across higher education   badges become a way to recognize learning in all of its forms bowen says passport provides a platform for anyone who wants to deliver learning credentials  from creation of the challenge to creating the actual badge image itself and then a way to display earned badges it s all built into the platform   many instructors are moving to new models of instruction and passport is a technology that supports many of those new models  gerry mccartney purdue s vice president for information technology cio and oesterle professor of information technology says digital badges can sometimes provide a better view of a student s academic experience   students learn in many ways and in a variety of settings while attending a university such as purdue mccartney says in addition to formal lectures and homework there is also time spent in labs and doing field work time spent in service projects or internships and experiences they glean from student organizations  the passport app will give interested faculty and advisers another way to recognize and validate those skills for students through their college careers students gain knowledge and skills that may not be well represented in their college degrees  a student may have learned practical skills such as knowing how to write html code have earned a prestigious scholarship or served as an officer in a student organization  digital badges are becoming a popular way to acknowledge professional skills and purdue university has released the passport application to allow instructors to create badges for their students  the creator tool in passport offers a variety of templates on which instructors or advisers can base their own badges purdue university image  download photo badges are currently in use or in development at institutions such as mit carnegie mellon the university of california davis and seton hall  organizations outside of higher education are issuing badges too including nasa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the u s  departments of veterans affairs and education the corporation for public broadcasting and the movie studio disney pixar purdue s passport platform integrates with the popular mozilla open badge infrastructure including mozilla backpack this system developed by the same organization that develops the firefox web browser allows the digital badge to include metadata such as who issued the badge how it was earned and when it was earned users display their badges through the backpack site  mark surman executive director of mozilla says badges empower learners to take charge of their online identities and reputations   we believe digital badges are the next step in unlocking the full educational potential of the web surman says as a nonprofit organization committed to the power of open collaboration and learning we re extremely excited to see purdue take this step  it s a milestone for the entire openbadges project bill watson an assistant professor in purdue s department of curriculum and instruction was instrumental in creating the passport platform and will be using passport in a graduate level course this semester he says the advantage of badges is that they allow faculty to focus on competencies skills and learner performance   typically in courses we have a number of very broad learning goals and grades are given out on student assignments tied to these broad goals watson says   but really it is more a comparison of students rather than a focus on student learning and attainment of desired learning outcomes   badges help instructors encourage students to demonstrate how they have met very specific learning objectives through actual performance   purdue s passport platform consists of two apps the passport app allows instructors to set the steps or challenges a student must achieve to earn the badge  the app also allows an instructor or adviser to create a badge by choosing from several templates the second part of the platform is passport profile  this is an app designed for tablets that allows users to display their badges both passport badges as well as badges from their mozilla backpack we ve created it so that you can easily show the badges and the information behind them while holding the tablet and showing it to someone bowen says   that way you don t have to keep taking the tablet away to navigate through the app you can show the work behind the badge as you speak   bowen says the passport profile app is operated a bit like a guitar a user holds his or her tablet with the screen facing the interviewer and operates tabs along the bottom of the screen as if they were frets on a guitar neck  then the user strums or flicks through screens and images to display his or her portfolio it s designed to work with large gestures so that you don t have to have a good view of it yourself to show off your portfolio bowen says   you don t have to click on small buttons with your fingertip you just make these large gestures that let you move through your presentation   a new ipad app created by purdue university allows users to display professional digital badges the app is part of purdue s passport platform and can display badges from the passport app or from the popular mozilla backpack   purdue university image download photo in addition to displaying passport badges the latest version of passport profile which has been submitted to the apple itunes app store can also display any mozilla open badge  each badge also has a url that users can share on social media sites as we get more users we ll build in a share function bowen says  a sample badge is available at http www openpassport org at the site users can create a passport account or login using their facebook or google credentials  among the first uses of badges at purdue will be for students who have successfully completed courses through nanohub u a collection of short courses in nanotechnology offered online to an international audience  the courses focus on technical subjects in science and engineering upcoming courses for this fall include fundamentals of atomic force microscopy and nanoscale transistors   students who successfully complete the courses based on scores from five weekly exams and the scientific simulation and virtual experimentation homework assignments will receive a badge  students who successfully completed previous purdue nanohub u courses in fundamentals of nanoelectronics have already been given the opportunity to receive passport badges  in the spring of 2013 nanohub u will offer badges for the classes from atoms to materials predictive theory and simulations and thermal energy at the nanoscale   purdue is looking for instructors or institutions that would like to try the beta version of passport as part of its test pilot program   we re looking for up to 200 instructors and up to 10 000 students outside of purdue to test the app bowen says there s no charge for instructors to use the app but we would like feedback on how it was used in the classroom and suggestions on how to improve the application   passport and passport profile are two of six classroom apps created by the purdue studio project the apps can be used by instructors or students to enhance the traditional classroom experience  media contact for mozilla open badges matt thompson

aS' disaster recovery expert on rebuilding 7 years after katrina west lafayette ind friendships and knowing one s neighbors are key to the hurricane katrina communities successfully rebuilding since the 2005 disaster says a purdue university disaster recovery expert   buildings may fall and streets may flood but these social connections survive during these disasters says daniel p aldrich an associate professor of political science and author of the new book building resilience social capital in post disaster recovery   the lesson learned from hurricane katrina is to stockpile friends because people who survive and then return to rebuild their community after a disaster are more likely to do so because of their individual friendships community connections and civic involvement   aldrich s book which will be released later this month by the university of chicago press looks at the role that friendships community relationships and civic participation play when recovering from a disaster  his study of hurricane katrina specifically focuses on the areas of the lower ninth ward and the village de l est both areas have similar poverty levels but the population of the village de l est rebounded and the community rebuilt quickly because of the residents social networks aldrich says   the village de l est is a vietnamese community strongly connected by its faith and strong relationships and after people were evacuated to other states church leaders drove to evacuation sites to meet with community members and share messages and photos between friends that had been dispersed aldrich says   when they returned to their neighborhood it was easy for them to work as a group to petition for the electricity to be restored and begin rebuilding   without these relationships people are not as successful at coordinating efforts and activities to rebuild the community loses its foundation   these social networks are so powerful that they also can have negative effects by influencing the recovery of other areas for example some areas in new orleans with higher civic participation and individual connections were able to mobilize to block temporary housing from being placed in their community   in this case one group s social capital pushed unwanted facilities into the backyards of weaker communities aldrich says aldrich also has studied disaster recovery and community rebuilding following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan the 2004 indian ocean tsunami in tamil nadu the 1923 earthquake in tokyo and the 1995 earthquake in kobe japan  aldrich who was a professor at tulane university when hurricane katrina hit new orleans credits a neighbor with encouraging his family to evacuate as the storm approached  he continues to work with colleagues at louisiana state university to study disaster recovery after the hurricane as well as after the april 2010 oil spill  aldrich and his colleagues are observing high rates of depression domestic violence and divorce as they interview area residents since the gulf spill   '

aS' double crop soybeans struggle to mature could be valuable forage west lafayette ind many of indiana s double crop soybeans will struggle to reach maturity before the first killing freeze meaning the plants could provide another forage option for livestock producers struggling to feed their herds  an early wheat harvest and dry spring weather allowed growers to plant double crop soybeans farther north in the state than what is typical but record setting heat and drought kept the crop from germinating in a timely manner or at all  fields that germinated late aren t likely to reach maturity and could potentially supplement the state s decimated livestock feed resources   soybeans that won t reach physiological maturity before a killing freeze do have value as forage at the proper stage of maturity said keith johnson purdue extension forage specialist   the crop should be harvested as a forage before green leaves begin to yellow johnson recommended harvesting the crop and ensiling it rather than harvesting it as hay  doing so reduces the loss of leaves which are the highest feed quality part of the plant it also lessens the likelihood of rain damage because the crop can be harvested as silage more quickly after cutting it as compared to making the soybean plant as hay   if chopped and ensiled livestock will be less likely to sort out the lower quality stem as compared to when soybeans are made and fed as long stemmed hay johnson said  grazing soybean fields also can be an option but it is more management intensive and comes with risks in my opinion grazing soybean forage is risky because it is difficult to control selective grazing of immature grain johnson said   founder and off feed problems could result if over consumption of the seed occurs growers and livestock producers also need to be aware of any pesticides that were applied to their crops including miticides used more heavily this year to combat spider mite infestation  pesticides have different harvest restrictions and some are not registered for use when soybeans are harvested as a forage crop  double crop soybean growers who don t produce livestock still might have opportunities to sell the ailing crop to local livestock producers  pricing is driven by current alfalfa prices and the soybean crop s forage quality and will depend on who provides the labor and equipment to harvest the crop   if the livestock producer is harvesting the crop the soybean grower would need to subtract out the harvest custom rates from the value of the forage johnson said  growers in much of the southern part of indiana are eligible to carry crop insurance on their double crop soybeans those who do will need to check with their insurance agents to get clearance before cutting the crop for forage   we don t know when that killing freeze will occur until maybe three days beforehand so it s important for growers to alert their crop insurance agents early if they are considering this option he said   '

aS' drought could cost farmers with future delivery contracts west lafayette ind drought conditions could hit indiana farmers in the pocketbook in more ways than one purdue extension agricultural economist chris hurt says  not only could water starved corn and soybean crops produce smaller yields and cut into farmers revenues but they also could force some growers who signed future delivery contracts with grain buyers to buy back some bushels they are unable to supply hurt said   we ve been hearing of producers calling their grain managers and talking with them about the possibilities of dealing with these yield reductions hurt said   right now it s hard to say what will happen because nobody knows where grain prices are going to go with some parts of indiana now nearing a month without significant rainfall and the critical pollination phase of corn either already started or about to begin large crop losses appear likely for some farmers  those losses would be especially painful for farmers who sold a large percentage of their anticipated corn crop this spring in forward cash contracts  in forward contracts producers promise to deliver a specified amount of grain to buyers well before their crops are harvested in turn farmers are guaranteed a set price for their grain even if grain prices fall below that set price before their deliveries are made  farmers face a double whammy if the drought persists hurt said on one hand they could fail to produce enough crop to meet their contractual obligations  on the other they could lose additional revenue if prices rise above their locked in rate hurt gave the example of a farmer who agreed to sell corn at 5 a bushel based on an anticipated production of 150 bushels per acre for 750 in revenue per acre  if drought reduced the farmer s production to 120 bushels per acre and pushed cash prices to 6 a bushel the farmer would deliver that smaller crop at the price agreed upon but then have to pay the buyer for the 30 bushels per acre the farmer was unable to supply  that undeliverable charge would be 30 per acre based on the 1 per bushel more than the contract price the grain is now worth   that 120 bushels delivered would only generate 600 for the farmer hurt said then after the farmer paid the 30 on the non delivered grain they would have only 570 of revenue per acre or 180 per acre less revenue than they had originally planned   first if they have a local buyer a grain elevator processor or local livestock operation they can buy back some of those bushels that have been forward sold he said   probably for most producers at this point they re going to have to pay some difference for those bushels lost but they would avoid further potential losses if prices move even higher   a second common strategy would be to buy futures to offset some of the price impacts buying futures still means they would be committed to deliver the cash position so that doesn t get them out of the need to physically deliver  but it does get them some recovery against even higher prices if prices go higher they could gain on their futures position and those gains could help offset losses on their cash forward contract   hurt said a third strategy is to buy call options contracts that give farmers the right but not the obligation to buy a fixed number of bushels for a specific price by a specific date   the farmer would have to pay a premium for those rights but would have price protection against rising prices hurt said options strategies do not deal with the need to deliver physical bushels they simply are used as a way to potentially generate positive returns if prices rise  these positive returns can then be used to offset some of the negative consequences of the bushels that cannot be delivered at higher prices   hurt urged farmers who are concerned that they have sold more bushels than they might produce to contact their grain buyers and discuss delivery alternatives  not all the news is bad in drought years farmers can still see their revenues increase through what economists call the natural hedge   it s this concept that when a major production state has reduced yields due to something like drought conditions prices generally go higher than yields go down hurt said   so if yield losses for an entire region or a state were 10 percent but prices go up by say 15 or 20 percent actual revenues in a drought year can be higher than in a year when you have normal yields   for example indiana s average corn yield in 2011 was down 7 percent from the previous year but prices were 16 percent higher meaning farmer revenues per acre were higher than in 2010  hurt said if yield losses are widespread enough this year higher prices would help compensate farmers for some of their lost crop  there is another glimmer of hope for farmers with grain left over from the 2011 crop season the longer the drought continues the better the odds that their stored grain will increase in value hurt said  with july corn futures moving prices to about 6 60 to 6 70 a bushel old crop cash corn should push past 7 per bushel hurt said   if we go above 6 75 or 6 80 on july futures then i think we ve got a real shot at retesting the all time highs at around 8   hurt said he talked to one farmer who has 88 000 bushels of old crop corn in storage that s over half a million dollars worth of corn he said  old crop soybeans could hit 15 a bushel and jump to about 16 50 per bushel should weather patterns remain unchanged hurt said   we have a very bullish situation ahead if the drought continues hurt said we could have quite an explosive market but that could all change if we get rain   '

aS' drought season highlights damage caused by nematodes west lafayette ind the drought throughout indiana is intensifying nematode damage in farm fields says a purdue extension nematologist  the needle nematode soybean cyst nematode and lance nematode all are causing more problems for grain farmers in a year when crops already are stressed by extreme heat and lack of rain  jamal faghihi explained that nematodes microscopic roundworms can be found in fields every year but the damage is worse during a drought season   the severity of symptoms shows because of the stress in plants he said farmers should know if they are having nematode problems at this point in the summer   they ve always been there if you looked hard enough faghihi said now you can t miss it the needle nematode exclusively feeds on corn and grasses and is found in sandy soils  the needle nematode often poses a problem in the spring when the weather is cool and wet although the needle nematode is sensitive to heat faghihi speculates that this year the early warm weather created an opportunity for the worm to do its damage early  he advised farmers to inspect the plant roots early in the season for abnormalities which include poor development club shaped roots and damage resembling herbicide injury  the lance nematode is found in corn and soybean fields similar to the needle nematode the lance nematode causes damage to plants that results in yellow stunted growth with abnormal roots  the lance nematode is not deterred by hot weather the soybean cyst nematode attacks soybean plants and causes the plant to become yellow and stunted  this nematode starts as a microscopic worm and ends its one month life cycle as a cyst containing 200 300 eggs earlier in the season the cysts are brown but this time of year they are white or yellow the size of a sugar granule and can be seen by the eye  faghihi said farmers should inspect for the presence of the cysts by digging out the root placing it in water and checking for cysts  the cysts are durable and can survive extreme conditions faghihi said most soybean cyst nematode resistant cultivars contain the same source of resistance pi 88788  nematodes however are overcoming that resistance he said farmers need to understand which resistor is being used in their crops and consider switching to soybeans with another source of resistance  soybeans with resistance derived from peking are something that faghihi said farmers should consider as they determine the best course of action for managing the soybean cyst nematodes  crop rotation is another important step farmers can take to weaken the stability of the nematodes because the worms feed exclusively on specific plants   '

aS' energy dense biofuel from cellulose close to being economical west lafayette ind a new purdue university developed process for creating biofuels has shown potential to be cost effective for production scale opening the door for moving beyond the laboratory setting  a purdue economic analysis shows that the cost of the thermo chemical h2bioil method is competitive when crude oil is about 100 per barrel when using certain energy methods to create hydrogen needed for the process  if a federal carbon tax were implemented the biofuel would become even more economical h2bioil is created when biomass such as switchgrass or corn stover is heated rapidly to about 500 degrees celcius in the presence of pressurized hydrogen  resulting gases are passed over catalysts causing reactions that separate oxygen from carbon molecules making the carbon molecules high in energy content similar to gasoline molecules  the conversion process was created in the lab of rakesh agrawal purdue s winthrop e stone distinguished professor of chemical engineering  he said h2bioil has significant advantages over traditional standalone methods used to create fuels from biomass the process is quite fast and converts entire biomass to liquid fuel agrawal said   as a result the yields are substantially higher once the process is fully developed due to the use of external hydrogen the yield is expected to be two to three times that of the current competing technologies   the economic analysis published in the june issue of biomass conversion and biorefinery shows that the energy source used to create hydrogen for the process makes all the difference when determining whether the biofuel is cost effective  hydrogen processed using natural gas or coal makes the h2bioil cost effective when crude oil is just over 100 per barrel but hydrogen derived from other more expensive energy sources nuclear wind or solar drive up the break even point   we re in the ballpark said wally tyner purdue s james and lois ackerman professor of agricultural economics in the past i have said that for biofuels to be competitive crude prices would need to be at about 120 per barrel  this process looks like it could be competitive when crude is even a little cheaper than that agrawal said he and colleagues fabio ribeiro a purdue professor of chemical engineering and nick delgass purdue s maxine spencer nichols professor of chemical engineering are working to develop catalysts needed for the h2bioil conversion processes  the method s initial implementation has worked on a laboratory scale and is being refined so it would become effective on a commercial scale   this economic analysis shows us that the process is viable on a commercial scale agrawal said we can now go back to the lab and focus on refining and improving the process with confidence   the model tyner used assumed that corn stover switchgrass and miscanthus would be the primary feedstocks the analysis also found that if a federal carbon tax were introduced driving up the cost of coal and natural gas more expensive methods for producing hydrogen would become competitive   if we had a carbon tax in the future the break even prices would be competitive even for nuclear tyner said wind and solar not yet but maybe down the road   the u s department of energy and the air force office of scientific research funded the research agrawal and his collaborators received a u s  patent for the conversion process sources wally tyner 765 494 0199 wtyner purdue edu rakesh agrawal 765 494 2257 agrawalr purdue edu abstract fast pyrolysis based processes can be built on small scale and have higher process carbon and energy efficiency as compared to other options  h2bioil is a novel process based on biomass fast hydropyrolysis and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation hdo and can potentially provide high yields of high energy density liquid fuel at relatively low hydrogen consumption  this paper contains a comprehensive financial analysis of the h2bioil process with hydrogen derived from different sources three different carbon tax scenarios are analyzed no carbon tax 55 metric ton carbon tax and 110 metric ton carbon tax  the break even crude oil price for a delivered biomass cost of 94 metric ton when hydrogen is derived from coal natural gas or nuclear energy ranges from 103 to 116 bbl for no carbon tax and even lower 99 111 bbl for the carbon tax scenarios  this break even crude oil price compares favorably with the literature estimated prices of fuels from alternate biochemical and thermochemical routes  the impact of the chosen carbon tax is found to be limited relative to the impact of the h2 source on the h2bioil break even price  the economic robustness of the processes for hydrogen derived from coal natural gas or nuclear energy is seen by an estimated break even crude oil price of 114 126 bbl when biomass cost is increased to 121 metric ton   '

aS' evidence of life on mars could come from martian moon the image shows the orbits of the martian moons phobos and deimos and the spread of potential particle trajectories from an asteroid impact on mars   purdue university image courtesy of loic chappaz download photo west lafayette ind a mission to a martian moon could return with alien life according to experts at purdue university but don t expect the invasion scenario presented by summer blockbusters like men in black 3 or prometheus   we are talking little green microbes not little green men said jay melosh a distinguished professor of earth atmospheric and planetary sciences and physics and aerospace engineering at purdue   a sample from the moon phobos which is much easier to reach than the red planet itself would almost surely contain martian material blasted off from large asteroid impacts  if life on mars exists or existed within the last 10 million years a mission to phobos could yield our first evidence of life beyond earth   melosh led a team chosen by nasa s planetary protection office to evaluate if a sample from phobos could contain enough recent material from mars to include viable martian organisms  the study was commissioned to prepare for the failed 2011 russian phobos grunt mission but there is continued international interest in a phobos mission he said  it will likely be a recurring topic as nasa reformulates its mars exploration program a phobos mission was discussed at nasa s concepts and approaches for mars exploration workshop and a report issued tuesday stated that the martian moons are important destinations that may provide much of the value of human surface exploration at reduced cost and risk   melosh collaborated with kathleen howell the hsu lo professor of aeronautical and astronautical engineering and graduate students loic chappaz and mar vaquero on the project  the researchers combined their expertise in impact cratering and orbital mechanics to determine how much material was displaced by particular asteroid impacts and whether individual particles would land on phobos the closer of the two martian moons  the team concluded that a 200 gram sample scooped from the surface of phobos could contain on average about one tenth of a milligram of mars surface material launched in the past 10 million years and 50 billion individual particles from mars  the same sample could contain as much as 50 milligrams of mars surface material from the past 3 5 billion years nasa s planetary protection office chose a team of purdue university researchers to evaluate if a sample from the moon phobos could contain enough material from mars to include viable martian organisms  the purdue team stands with an image of possible particle trajectories from an asteroid impact standing from left are professors kathleen howell jay melosh and graduate students loic chappaz and mar vaquero   purdue university photo mark simons download photo the time frames are important because it is thought that after 10 million years of exposure to the high levels of radiation on phobos any biologically active material would be destroyed howell said   of course older martian material would still be rich with information but there would be much less concern about bringing a viable organism back to earth and necessary quarantine measures   when an asteroid hits the surface of a planet it ejects a cone shaped spray of surface material similar to the splash created when someone does a cannonball into a swimming pool  these massive impacts pulverize the surface material and scatter high speed fragments the team calculated that the bulk of the fragments from such a blast on mars would be particles about one thousandth of a millimeter in diameter or 100 times smaller than a grain of sand but similar in size to terrestrial bacteria  the team followed the possible paths the tiny particles could take as they were hurtled from the planet s surface through space examining possible speeds angles of departure and orbital forces  the team plotted more than 10 million trajectories and evaluated which would intercept phobos and where they might land on the moon during its eight hour orbit around mars  the probability of a particle landing on phobos depends primarily on the power of the blast that launched it from the surface chappaz said   it is estimated that during the past 10 million years there have been at least four large impact events powerful enough to launch material into space and we focused on several large craters as possible points of origin he said   it turns out that no matter where phobos is in its orbit it would have captured material from these powerful impact events after the team submitted its report scientists identified a large nearly 60 kilometers in diameter crater on mars  the crater named mojave is estimated to be less than 5 million years old and its existence suggests that there would be an even greater amount of martian material on phobos that could contain viable organisms than estimated melosh said   it is not outside the realm of possibility that a sample could contain a dormant organism that might wake up when exposed to more favorable conditions on earth he said   i participated in a study that found that living microbes can survive launch from impacts on rock and other studies have shown some microscopic organisms can tolerate a lot of cosmic radiation   this possibility has been a consideration for some time and michael crichton s the andromeda strain brought it to public consciousness in 1969  however the movie scenario of a fatal contamination is unlikely melosh said approximately one ton of martian material lands on earth every year he said   there is a lot more swapping back and forth of material within our solar system than people realize in fact we may owe our existence to life on mars   it s difficult to believe there hasn t been life somewhere out there in the vast expanse of space howell said the question is if the timeline overlaps with ours enough for us to recognize it  even if we found no evidence of life in a sample from phobos it would not be a definitive answer to the question of whether or not there was life on mars  there still may have been life that existed too long ago for us to detect it melosh recently presented the team s findings at a joint nasa and european space agency meeting in austria and chappaz will present the data at a meeting on july 14 in mysore india   '

aS' excited about a cloudy future at purdue university and emc bringing massive data storage to students and faculty excited about a cloudy future at purdue university and emc bringing massive data storage to students and faculty west lafayette ind   comedian george carlin famously observed that all you need in life is a place to put your stuff for college students where to put their digital stuff including materials developed through their academic careers their many favorite photos and a multitude of other digital files can be a problem  it s an even bigger problem for researchers and instructors who may have enormous data files that need to be managed curated and analyzed  a new service at purdue however called boilerbackpack will give students faculty and staff 100 gigabytes of personal storage so everyone at purdue will have a large amount of space to store their digital stuff  purdue and emc corp are embarking on a five year relationship that will both address the issue of where students and faculty can put their digital files as well as develop solutions that can be adapted throughout higher education   when we looked to solve our data management and storage issues we wanted to look well beyond current practices and work to develop new solutions that can move science forward and improve student success says gerry mccartney chief information officer faculty member of the college of technology at purdue and the olga oesterle england professor of information technology   emc is the only corporation we talked to that had the capability to both address our current data storage needs and to partner with us to develop new technologies to improve data management   purdue is naming emc as one of its foundational it partners a group that includes intel hp and cisco foundational it partners work with the university in developing new technologies to be used in higher education and scientific discovery  the purdue partnership fits well with emc s goal of transforming it says pat gelsinger president and chief operating officer of emc information infrastructure products   the amount of digital information in the world will grow forty four fold this decade and in some academic disciplines such as bioinformatics datasets have become so large that they defy the ability of conventional forms of information technology to store manage analyze and gather important insights from them gelsinger says   emc s partnership with purdue is designed to advance new technology architectures and algorithms to deal with the challenges of all of this big data   for faculty and students at purdue the most visible and immediate benefit of the agreement will be in place when they return for classes in the fall of 2012 with the launch of the boilerbackpack service  the service will be similar to other popular cloud data services which typically offer between 2 gb to 7gb of free storage like those services backpack will allow students and faculty to sync files access those files from any computer and share files or folders with others  boilerbackpack apps will be available for android smartphones apple iphones and ipads as well as apps for windows and macintosh desktop computers  as with the commercial services boilerbackpack users will be able to purchase additional storage space if needed and the university is exploring ways to allow students to continue to use the service after they graduate   we ll announce specific details of the service as it launches in august but we re pleased to offer our students and faculty a needed resource that they wouldn t find at this scale on any other campus mccartney says  beyond the cloud storage service for the purdue community emc and purdue will work together in several specific ways emc and purdue will jointly develop a new architecture for research data management and curation   emc and purdue will work to develop new technologies to ingest analyze transfer and manage enormous research data sets especially in the field of bioinformatics   with emc s assistance purdue will begin building a repository of all purdue intellectual property research engineers and scientists from both organizations will work together on academic papers and presentations as well as presentations at trade conferences  the purdue emc relationship is needed to address the challenges and opportunities of using data analysis of massive data sets so called big data to gain insights and forecast outcomes by both researchers and students at purdue  purdue has been a leader in using data sets to improve student success and retention with its signals data analytics program big data will be to the next decade what the internet was to the 1990s and early 2000s mccartney says   over the next ten years it will change businesses and education in ways that we can t imagine right now with this partnership we re positioning purdue to be a leader in these changes   our foundational it partner companies have not only committed to provide excellent products and service to purdue but they have also committed to work with us to develop technologies to speed the pace of scientific discoveries and to improve the rate of student success in higher education mccartney says   emc is exactly the kind of company we are looking to partner with in this effort and because we will be advancing data science this relationship has the potential to change every market that uses the internet   '

project for interdisciplinary and distance learning based on the prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases  sophie leli vre the 2012 faculty fellow for the discovery learning research center and a college of veterinary medicine professor is leading the effort to educate and focus the attention of researchers on the little studied field of preventative medicine   my goal is to develop a learning system across disciplines on primary prevention of breast cancer to facilitate the design of multidisciplinary research projects among scholars and prepare future scholars for interdisciplinary and international work in public health leli vre said  leli vre pronounced le lee yea vre believes that primary prevention research is underrepresented in the scientific community  her proposal for a distance learning program was intended to correct this by exposing a large number of college science students across many universities to the current state of the research  future members of the scientific community are drawn from this pool so this should result in a greater awareness and representation of this field  currently leli vre is studying the development and behavior of both normal and cancerous cells using a three dimensional culture that permits the architectural mimicry of physiologically relevant tissue  in particular this culturing method allows her to study the effect of polarity the way cells organize themselves to make certain structures face certain directions on the development of tumors  her laboratory also examines how the genome of cells is affected by the organization of cell components in the nucleus in relation to tissue architecture   most of those who study cancer use already cancerous cells for their research in primary prevention

aS' football findings suggest concussions caused by series of hits members of the jefferson high school football team seen here during a practice last season were monitored in research to learn how impacts to the head affect brain function   purdue university file photo andrew hancock download photo west lafayette ind a two year study of high school football players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head as commonly believed  purdue university researchers have studied football players for two seasons at jefferson high school in lafayette ind where 21 players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season including 16 repeating players  helmet sensor impact data from each player were compared with brain imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before during and after each season   the most important implication of the new findings is the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow but it s really the totality of blows that took place over the season said eric nauman an associate professor of mechanical engineering and an expert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma   the one hit that brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel s back researchers evaluated players using a type of brain imaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging or fmri along with a computer based neurocognitive screening test  the fmri scans reveal which parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks thomas talavage an expert in functional neuroimaging and co director of the purdue mri facility said the scans indicate players are adapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes   the changes in brain activity we are observing suggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced talavage said   the level of change in the fmri signal is significantly correlated to the number and distribution of hits that a player takes performance doesn t change but brain activity changes showing that certain areas are no longer being recruited to perform a task   brain scans show differences among high school football players in a two year study that suggests concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head as commonly believed   purdue university image thomas talavage download photo findings detailed in a paper to appear online in the journal of biomechanics are contrary to conventional thinking   most clinicians would say that if you don t have any concussion symptoms you have no problems said larry leverenz an expert in athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology   however we are finding that there is actually a lot of change even when you don t have symptoms the paper was written by mechanical engineering graduate student evan breedlove nauman leverenz talavage former purdue professor of educational studies jeffrey gilger biomedical engineering graduate student meghan robinson health and kinesiology graduate student katherine e  morigaki electrical and computer engineering graduate student umit yoruk mechanical engineering undergraduate student kyle o keefe and undergraduate student in electrical and computer engineering jeffrey king  gilger is now a researcher at the university of california merced the research may help to determine how many blows it takes to cause impairment which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting the number of hits a player receives per week   any change in fmri data is a concern but we don t yet know what these changes mean what they translate to in terms of cognitive impairment breedlove said  a common assumption in sports medicine is that certain people are innately more susceptible to head injury however the new findings suggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the most important factor talavage said   over the two seasons we had six concussed players but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not have concussions talavage said   there is good correlation with the number of hits players received but we need more subjects the researchers have expanded the study to include an additional high school football team and girls soccer   we want to increase the number of football players in the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don t wear head protection nauman said   we also want to include girls to see whether they are affected differently than boys the research findings represent a dilemma because they suggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose   this might be especially important in young people because the brain is still developing so even though subtle unexpressed damage doesn t manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life gilger said  changes were seen in regions of the brain that have been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte a progressive degenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and other forms of head injury   this is still circumstantial evidence but it suggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as a result of all these hits and the regions most affected are the ones that exhibit cte nauman said  players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1 900 hits to the head in a single season with two players exceeding 1 800 hits  helmet sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 gs to more than 100 gs the worst hit we ve seen was almost 300 gs nauman said  a soccer player heading a ball experiences an impact of about 20 gs findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive and accurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions more accurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from head impacts determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a single impact or repeated impacts and develop new interventions to reduce the risk and effects of head impacts   now that we know there is definitely a buildup of damage before the concussion occurs ultimately there is hope that we can do more to prevent concussions nauman said  the work is ongoing and supported with grants from the indiana state department of health s spinal cord and brain injury research fund general electric healthcare the indiana clinical and translational sciences institute and through the national science foundation and national defense science and engineering graduate fellowships  researchers also will follow the case studies of players who take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes in brain structure using mri scans  the research group called the purdue neurotrauma group png also is studying ways to reduce traumatic brain injury in soldiers

issue in the united states and chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte is the chief long term concern linked to repeated concussions  recently attention has shifted toward subconcussive blows and the role they may play in the development of cte we assembled a cohort of high school football players for two seasons of observation  accelerations sensors were placed in the helmets and all contact activity was monitored pre season computer based neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri tests were also obtained in order to assess cognitive and physiological health  in season follow up scans were then obtained both from individuals who had sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion and those who had not  these changes were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan  in addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes  stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the biomechanical histories of subjects and the ensuing neurophysiological change suggesting that distinct injury processes are at play  our findings reinforce the hypothesis that the effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative and that repeated exposure to subconcussive blows is connected to pathologically altered neurophysiology   '

aS' glyphosate resistant superweeds may be less susceptible to diseases purdue scientists found that soil microbes may play a role in how those weeds react to the popular herbicide glyphosate here glyphosate susceptible biotypes of giant ragweed react differently to the herbicide  the plant on the left is in sterilized field soil void of microbes while the plant on the right is in unsterilized soil photo provided by jessica schafer  west lafayette ind scientists searching for clues to understand how superweeds obtain resistance to the popular herbicide glyphosate may have been missing a critical piece of information a purdue university study shows  glyphosate the active ingredient in the weed killer sold under the name roundup is the most widely used herbicide in the united states but some plants have grown resistant to it  this has caused farmers to turn to additional herbicides while the mechanisms that have led to resistance are not fully known bill johnson a professor of weed science steve hallett an associate professor of weed science and jessica schafer a graduate student in botany and plant pathology believe that soil microbes may play a role  most laboratory tests done to understand glyphosate resistance are done in sterile soil void of those microbes schafer said purdue s findings published online early in the journal weed science show that those microbes may play a significant role in how glyphosate affects plants the soil you re growing the plants in is important to the results schafer said   if we re growing in a sterile media we could get some false positive results because the plants are more tolerant to glyphosate in those conditions   hallett and schafer grew giant ragweed horseweed and common lambsquarter in both sterile soil and field soil and subjected them to glyphosate  in each soil strains of weeds both susceptible and resistant to glyphosate were tested both versions of giant ragweed were damaged more from the glyphosate in field soil  the susceptible version of common lambsquarter was also more heavily damaged in field soil horseweed fared the same no matter which soil or strain susceptible or resistant  the results show that microbes can play an important role in the activity of glyphosate presumably by invading the glyphosate weakened plants  the results also suggest that glyphosate resistant weeds may be more resistant to disease pressure as well soil microbes can be minor to major contributors to how glyphosate is able to affect plants hallett said   we may be selecting not only for glyphosate resistance but inadvertently selecting for weeds that have disease resistance as well   a weed s ability to withstand glyphosate was based on dry shoot and root weight after testing the sterile soil used in the study came from field soil exposed to gamma radiation to kill microbes and bacteria  the irradiated soil was tested to ensure that its nutrients were not diminished hallett johnson and schafer said further studies would look at how fungi in the soil affect root development both with and without glyphosate   dirt is a living organism johnson said it s important to know how all the pieces interact the research was conducted with internal funding from purdue s department of botany and plant pathology  response of giant ragweed ambrosia trifida horseweed conyza canadensis and common lambsquarter chenopodium album biotypes to glyphosate in the presence and absence of soil microorganisms in previous research conducted on non weed species the efficacy of glyphosate was shown to be greater in unsterile soils compared to sterile soils and that soil microorganisms played an important role in glyphosate efficacy  conducting greenhouse studies in microbe free soil may therefore produce unreliable data leading to erroneous conclusions the objective of this study was to determine the effect of soil microorganisms on the response of glyphosate resistant and susceptible biotypes of three problematic weeds of the midwestern united states giant ragweed horseweed and common lambsquarters  a greenhouse dose response study was conducted on each of the three weed species grown in sterile and unsterile field soil and the dry weight response of roots and shoots was measured  the three weed species responded differently to glyphosate when grown in the sterile and unsterile soil that is in the presence and absence of soil microbes  soil microbes influenced the response of the susceptible and resistant giant ragweed biotypes and the susceptible common lambsquarters but not on the tolerant common lambsquarters or either horseweed biotype  the different response of the three species to glyphosate in the presence and absence of soil microbes demonstrates that rhizosphere interactions are fundamental to the mode of action of glyphosate  these findings suggest that the range of tolerance to glyphosate observed in weeds and the evolution of resistance in weed biotypes may also be influenced by rhizosphere interactions  the soil media used in dose response screenings to identify susceptible and resistant weed biotypes is very important unsterile field soil should be incorporated into growth media when conducting dose response screenings to avoid false positive results  in addition researchers performing glyphosate dose response assays should be aware of these findings '

aS' india needs system reforms in education infrastructure culture to grow innovation and commercialization efforts india needs system reforms in education infrastructure culture to grow innovation and commercialization efforts west lafayette ind   india remains one of the world s fastest growing economies but cultural educational infrastructure and leadership challenges are inhibiting growth of its innovation and commercialization efforts a new study by a purdue university professor shows  pankaj sharma a purdue professor with a courtesy appointment in technology leadership and innovation and a native of india who moved to the united states in 1982 said india needs systems driven reforms to promote growth and innovation and sustain the economic growth it has achieved in recent decades his study titled india s national and regional innovation systems challenges opportunities and recommendations for policy makers has been published this month in the journal of industry and innovation the study was done in conjunction with sharma s appointment as a u s state department fulbright new century scholar   there is a need for necessary reforms to affect major change in the innovation system of india but there are both social and cultural barriers such as limited teamwork education and the enduring importance of upward hierarchical progression among other obstacles sharma said   a lack of confidence in innovation capabilities is coupled with a failure to positively reinforce innovation efforts and a strong need for control which gets in the way of cooperation with other organizations   a key challenge facing indian universities research institutions and corporations is an educational system established during the pre liberalization era that emphasizes learning through memorization rather than factual understanding teamwork and creative thinking   the lack of quality education has churned out a workforce with inefficient and inadequate skills rendering the industry academia linkage relatively weak over time said sharma who also serves as managing director of purdue s global sustainability institute in discovery park researchers in india also seem more motivated by publication of their research not patenting and commercialization that could advance the impact of their efforts he said  sharma says india faces a shortage and even an absence in some cases of the necessary support mechanisms that foster commercialization and innovation research funds venture capital funds and start up capital as well as awareness programs and initiatives   a lack of these support systems has resulted in a limited number of innovative ideas relatively few motivated individuals and subsequently very few or minimal incentives for people to generate innovative ideas he said  since its independence from great britain in 1947 india s economy has surged by more than 200 times its per capita annual income led by increases in the size of a middle class consumer a relatively young labor force the manufacturing sector and considerable foreign investments  india s economy ranks as the 11th largest in the world and is the third largest based on purchasing power despite those enviable statistics and an economy ranking among the world s leaders in the mid 2000s indian corporations still face major infrastructure leadership and cultural challenges  to address those sharma says indian companies must focus on local needs by improving basic civil infrastructure such as transportation sanitation and water health care and energy systems  nearly 400 million people in india for example lack access to electricity india spends less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care  for its educational and research institutions india must scale up its entrepreneurial courses and programs and focus on research and technology development relevant to india s infrastructure needs water purification energy pharmaceuticals and pesticides for crops for example  he encouraged indian institutions to reach out to foreign universities to bolster their technology commercialization efforts and heighten collaboration with industry to transfer knowledge as technology  moreover the nation can provide networking opportunities and offer funding incentives that encourage researchers to start companies   most people in indian society are risk averse failure is neither tolerated nor accepted by such people sharma said this lack of tolerance toward failure instills the fear of taking risks  thus making it difficult for them to generate innovative ideas or to promote existing ones eight regional clusters of business incubators educational research institutions and corporations have been identified  the mumbai and pune clusters accounted for the largest number of patent applications followed by the bangalore and delhi clusters  a policy recommendation is to foster local interaction among these actors to exploit synergy to promote innovation and regional economic development  ian p mccarthy the canada research chair in technology operations management and director of the cma innovation centre at simon fraser university in vancouver said the work by sharma provides insights on how the growth of clusters and associated industries contributes to the recent economic growth and development within a number of regions across india   research on the interplay between innovation systems and economic development is regarded as being important to national and regional competiveness  yet there is a dearth of research on how these mechanisms function in the india mccarthy said miranda schreurs director of the environmental policy research centre at germany s freie university in berlin pointed out that sharma and his co authors surveyed more than 30 business incubators funding agencies and research institutions determining what stimulates innovation and what obstructs it  they identify locations in india that generate many patents an indication of innovation governments professor sharma argues could stimulate greater innovation by investing in the development of science and technology entrepreneurial parks and technology business incubators that place scientists and researchers in close proximity with business entrepreneurs she said   although he focuses his attention on the indian context much of what he argues applies to other countries as well note to journalists  a copy of the research paper india s national and regional innovation systems challenges opportunities and recommendations for policy makers is available by contacting phillip fiorini purdue news service at pfiorini purdue edu 765 496 3133 india s national and regional innovation systems challenges opportunities and recommendations for policy makers there is a need for continuous reforms in india s infrastructure innovation culture and dynamic leadership to sustain the growth of innovation  the purpose of this empirical study is to gain a better understanding of india s innovation systems a comprehensive analysis on two levels has been done on both a national level and a regional level  first the section about the national level explores and explains the challenges and opportunities of india s innovation capacity using a semi structured questionnaire of the practitioners  second the section about the regional level discusses the clusters formed within india through a mapping of industrial firms educational research institutions and innovation parks  both an empirical activity framework and a functional based

aS' innovation promises expanded roles for microsensors researchers have learned how to improve the performance of sensors that use tiny vibrating microcantilevers like the one pictured here to detect chemical and biological agents for applications from national security to food processing   vijay kumar birck nanotechnology center purdue university west lafayette ind researchers have learned how to improve the performance of sensors that use tiny vibrating microcantilevers to detect chemical and biological agents for applications from national security to food processing  the microcantilevers slivers of silicon shaped like small diving boards vibrate at their natural or resonant frequency analyzing the frequency change when a particle lands on the microcantilever reveals the particle s presence and potentially its mass and composition  the sensors are now used to research fundamental scientific questions however recent advances may allow for reliable sensing with portable devices opening up a range of potential applications said jeffrey rhoads an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at purdue university creating smaller sensors has been complicated by the fact that measuring the change in frequency does not work as well when the sensors are reduced in size  the researchers showed how to sidestep this obstacle by measuring amplitude or how far the diving board moves instead of frequency   when you try to shrink these systems the old way of measuring does not work as well rhoads said we ve made the signal processing part easier enabling small scale lower power sensors which are more reliable and have the potential for higher sensitivities   findings are detailed in a paper appearing online this week in the journal of microelectromechanical systems the paper was written by graduate research assistants vijay kumar and j  william boley undergraduate student yushi yang mechanical engineering professor george chiu and rhoads an earlier paper was published in april in the weekly journal applied physics letters the work is based at the dynamic analysis of micro and nanosystems laboratory at purdue s birck nanotechnology center  the aim is to apply the new approach to build sensors capable of reliably measuring particles that have a mass of less than one picogram or trillionth of a gram at room temperature and atmospheric pressure  the microcantilever sensors have promise in detecting and measuring constituents such as certain proteins or dna for biological testing in liquids gases and the air  the devices might find applications in breath analyzers industrial and food processing national security and defense and food and water quality monitoring   one question about these sensors is whether they will continue to work in the field rhoads said we ve been doing a lot of blind false positive and false negative tests to see how they perform in a realistic environment  we ve had only a few false positives and negatives in months of testing the findings focus on detecting gases and show that the new sensors should be capable of more reliably measuring smaller quantities of gas than is possible with current sensors  measuring amplitude is far easier than measuring frequency because the amplitude changes dramatically when a particle lands on the microcantilever whereas the change in frequency is minute   we haven t beaten the sensitivity of all other sensors yet rhoads said but the difference is that we are trying to do it with a compact device that is truly implementable at the microscale while many others use fairly large laboratory equipment   the researchers tested the cantilevers in a chamber filled with precisely controlled quantities of methanol to study their reliability  a patent is pending on the invention the research has been partially funded by the national science foundation student support was provided by purdue and the purdue research foundation  note to journalists electronic copies

j william boley student member ieee asme george t   c chiu member ieee asme jeffrey f rhoads member asme the potential to detect very small amounts of added mass has driven research in chemical and biological sensors based on resonant micro and nano electromechanical systems over the past two decades  while traditional resonant mass sensors utilize chemomechanically induced shifts in linear natural frequency for mass detection alternate sensing approaches which exploit the near resonant nonlinear behavior have garnered interest from the research community due to their potential to yield improved sensor metrics and simplify final device implementations  this paper investigates the development of an amplitude based mass sensing approach which utilizes the dynamic transitions that occur near a saddle node bifurcation in the nonlinear frequency response of a piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever  specifically the work details the modeling analysis and experimental validation of this mass sensing technique the experimental results presented here not only prove the feasibility of the proposed sensing approach but also allows for the direct evaluation of pertinent sensor metrics   '

aS' ipad pharmacy checklist could be prescription for better health matthew murawski a purdue associate professor of pharmacy administration holds an ipad featuring his pharmaceutical therapy related quality of life tool  the tool presents patients with a five question survey that catches medication related side effects purdue university photo andrew hancock  west lafayette ind a quick interactive survey taken on an ipad could help pharmacists and patients better use their brief time together to catch and eliminate harmful drug side effects  matthew murawski a purdue university associate professor of pharmacy administration created a new tool that presents patients with a five question checklist that catches up to 60 percent of all known medication side effects   many patients do not mention side effects to their doctor or pharmacist because they either don t recognize that they are connected to the medication or they consider them the cost they must pay to keep from being ill or dying murawski said   in addition patients who are experiencing side effects are less likely to take the medication as prescribed or may stop taking the medication altogether which can lead to catastrophic health consequences  pharmacists can work with patients to eliminate most of these side effects but they can t help if they don t know what the patient is experiencing   exponential growth in the traffic at pharmacies over the past few decades has slashed the time pharmacists have with each patient to an average of two minutes one third of what the counseling time was 20 years ago and a system was needed to help make the discovery of adverse reactions easier and more efficient he said   with all of the training and education invested in every pharmacist i honestly believe they are the most underutilized health care practitioners murawski said   this tool makes the few minutes available for counseling much more rewarding the checklist results allow the pharmacist to immediately see side effects the patient is experiencing and target their time to solving these problems and improving the patient s quality of life   pharmacists may suggest simple changes like taking a medication after meals or avoiding certain foods or they can work with a patient s physician to change medications or develop a different therapy plan he said  when a patient arrives at a pharmacy they could be handed an ipad with the checklist to fill out while they wait a list of medications including both the generic and brand names is presented on the first screen and the pharmacist selects the medication the patient is taking  a patient is then presented with yes or no questions that cover the most common and serious side effect symptoms and the degree to which the problems are experienced  once the checklist is complete the ipad is returned to the pharmacist the results are displayed as colored bars that show which side effects occurred and which are most problematic  after each consultation the pharmacist resets the checklist before the next patient uses the ipad because the patient does not enter any identifying information and the checklist results are not saved the same ipad can be used by multiple patients without the risk of revealing private information  patients would have the option of allowing their anonymous results to be collected for further research into the incidence of adverse reactions and harmful side effects  murawski s method named pharmaceutical therapy related quality of life or ptrqol began as paper checklists that took up multiple file folders behind a pharmacist s desk  mark sharp director of purdue s hook teleproduction center helped automate the paper checklist and created the user interface and software that is compatible with ipads and other tablet devices and platforms  side effects from medication use in the general population are not routinely tracked and reported the results of clinical trials and the federal government s adverse event notification system were the only sources of such information when murawski began his research two years ago  these represent the extremes of the best and worst conditions he said clinical trials involve ideal conditions in which preselected patients take the drugs exactly according to direction and the adverse event notification system is used only for really severe problems murawski said   these results do not necessarily translate to the reality of use in the general public i wanted to know the sharp end of the spear what was actually happening in the pharmacies and with the average person   a seed grant from lilly endowment inc through purdue s college of pharmacy funded murawski s investigation into the side effects being experienced by patients at 10 community pharmacies in indiana  murawski focused his study on the top 200 most dispensed drugs in the united states which account for 90 percent of the volume in pharmacies  he sorted these medications by their drug classes and then cataloged all of the potential side effects for each class from the 2 000 surveys completed at the sites murawski found that approximately 50 percent of patients reported experiencing a symptom that could be a drug related side effect and pharmacists were able to confirm 20 percent of these were directly tied to medication use  he extracted the incidence rates of each side effect and created a new checklist weighted by the severity of the problem and the most common problems experienced  sometimes side effect symptoms can be a sign of something more serious including taking an improper dose of the drug an interaction with another medication or a harmful drug reaction  the sooner a pharmacist or physician can detect such problems the better murawski said in addition to health risks such problems can be expensive  according to a study published in the journal of the american pharmaceutical association the cost associated with managing drug related problems exceeded 177 4 billion in 2000  the costs to people s health and the health care system from patients not taking a drug as prescribed or discontinuing a medication without consulting a health care practitioner have not been well documented  a study by the international society for pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research that examined drug compliance for patients suffering from diabetes or osteoporosis found that the rate of hospitalization increased as adherence to a medication regimen dropped and overall medical charges were much higher for those who did not take medication as prescribed   if someone stops taking a drug as prescribed for a chronic condition there will be health consequences immediately or years down the road murawski said   the detrimental health effects could lead to hospitalizations or the development of another illness and this can be very expensive for both the individual and the health care system as whole  it is very important to try to work with someone to solve any issues that could keep them from taking a drug as prescribed in addition to the ipad tool murawski sees the potential for a kiosk version that could be integrated with a pharmacy s computer system  a patient could swipe an id card or type in their name and the system would tailor the checklist to their medication records he also hopes pharmacies could incorporate the results into a patient s record and maintain an ongoing history that would allow for more in depth questions with each subsequent visit   currently we present a patient with five questions that get about 50 to 60 percent of all side effects he said if we have more time and can continue down the list of questions and get more specific we could capture all known side effects   murawski plans to continue to accumulate checklist results and gather data about the incidence and severity of medication side effects in the general population and to further refine the ptrqol tool

aS'  nano machine shop shapes nanowires ultrathin films this illustration depicts a new nano machine shop s ability to shape tiny wires an advance that represents a possible future manufacturing method for applications ranging from high speed electronics to solar cells   purdue university image gary cheng download photo west lafayette ind a new nano machine shop that shapes nanowires and ultrathin films could represent a future manufacturing method for tiny structures with potentially revolutionary properties  the structures might be tuned for applications ranging from high speed electronics to solar cells and also may have greater strength and unusual traits such as ultrahigh magnetism and plasmonic resonance which could lead to improved optics computers and electronics  the researchers used their technique to stamp nano and microgears form tiny circular shapes out of a material called graphene an ultrathin sheet of carbon that holds promise for advanced technologies and change the shape of silver nanowires said gary cheng an associate professor of industrial engineering at purdue university we do this shaping at room temperature and atmospheric pressure like a nano machine shop said cheng who is working with doctoral students ji li yiliang liao ting fung chung and sergey suslov and physics professor yong p  chen graphene and nanowires filaments 1 000 times thinner than a human hair have numerous potential applications however technologies are needed to tailor them for specific uses  the new method called laser shock induced shaping makes it possible to tune nanowires by altering electrical and optoelectrical properties that are critical for electronic components  the researchers also have shown how laser shock induced shaping can be used to change the properties of graphene a step toward harnessing the material for electronic applications  findings were detailed in research papers published in the journal nano letters and the work also was highlighted earlier this month in the news and views section of the journal nature photonics the article is available at http www nature com nphoton journal v6 n8 full nphoton 2012 186 html the technique works by using a multilayered sandwich structure that has a tiny mold at the bottom  nanowires were situated directly above the mold and other materials were layered between the nanowires and a glass cover sheet  exposing this layered forming unit to an ultra fast pulsing laser causes one of the layers to burn up generating a downward pressure that forces the nanowires into the mold and changes their shape   the process could be scaled up for an industrial roll to roll manufacturing process by changing laser beam size and scanning speed cheng said   the laser shock induced shaping approach is fast and low cost part of the research funded by the national science foundation was carried out in a specialized clean room at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park  note to journalists copies of the research papers are available by contacting emil venere 765 494 4709 venere purdue edu abstract graphene has many promising physical properties it has been discovered that local strain in a graphene sheet can alter its conducting properties and transport gaps  it is of great importance to develop scalable strain engineering techniques to control the local strains in graphene and understand the limit of the strains  here we present a scalable manufacturing process to generate 3 d nanostructures and thus induce local strains in the graphene sheet  this process utilizes laser induced shock pressure to generate 3 d tunable straining the graphene sheet the size dependent straining limit of the graphene and the critical breaking pressure are both studied  it is found that the graphene film can be formed to a circular mold 126 50nm in diameter with an aspect ratio of 0 25 and strain of 12 and the critical breaking pressure is 1 77gpa  these values were found to be decreasing with the increase of mold size the local straining and breaking of graphene film are verified by raman spectra  large scale processing of the graphene sheet into nano scale patterns is presented the process could be scaled up to roll to roll process by changing laser beam size and scanning speed  the presented laser shock straining approach is a fast tunable and low cost technique to realize strain engineering of graphene for its applications in nano electrical devices  abstract one dimensional nanomaterials have attracted a great deal of research interest in the past few decades due to their unique mechanical electrical and optical properties  changing the shape of nanowires nws is both challenging and crucial to change the property and open wide functions of nws such as strain engineering electronic transport mechanical properties band structure and quantum properties etc  here we report a scalable strategy to conduct cutting bending and periodic straining of nws by making use of laser shock pressure  three dimensional shaping of silver nws is demonstrated during which the ag nws exhibit very good ductility strain to failure reaches 110  meanwhile the high electrical conductivity of ag nws could retain well under controlled laser shock pressure the microstructure observation indicates that the main deformation mechanism in ag nws under dynamic loading is formation of twinning and stacking fault while dislocation motion and pile up is less obvious  this method could be applied to semiconductor nws as well '

aS'  nanoresonators might improve cell phone performance this image from a scanning electron microscope shows a tiny mechanical device an electrostatically actuated nanoresonator that might ease congestion over the airwaves to improve the performance of cell phones and other portable devices   purdue university image download photo west lafayette ind researchers have learned how to mass produce tiny mechanical devices that could help cell phone users avoid the nuisance of dropped calls and slow downloads  the devices are designed to ease congestion over the airwaves to improve the performance of cell phones and other portable devices   there is not enough radio spectrum to account for everybody s handheld portable device said jeffrey rhoads an associate professor of mechanical engineering at purdue university  the overcrowding results in dropped calls busy signals degraded call quality and slower downloads to counter the problem industry is trying to build systems that operate with more sharply defined channels so that more of them can fit within the available bandwidth   to do that you need more precise filters for cell phones and other radio devices systems that reject noise and allow signals only near a given frequency to pass said saeed mohammadi an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering who is working with rhoads doctoral student hossein pajouhi and other researchers  the purdue team has created devices called nanoelectromechanical resonators which contain a tiny beam of silicon that vibrates when voltage is applied  researchers have shown that the new devices are produced with a nearly 100 percent yield meaning nearly all of the devices created on silicon wafers were found to function properly   we are not inventing a new technology we are making them using a process that s amenable to large scale fabrication which overcomes one of the biggest obstacles to the widespread commercial use of these devices rhoads said  findings are detailed in a research paper appearing online in the journal ieee transactions on nanotechnology the paper was written by doctoral students lin yu and pajouhi rhoads mohammadi and graduate student molly nelis  in addition to their use as future cell phone filters such nanoresonators also could be used for advanced chemical and biological sensors in medical and homeland defense applications and possibly as components in computers and electronics  the devices are created using silicon on insulator or soi fabrication the same method used by industry to manufacture other electronic devices  the resonators can be readily integrated into electronic circuits and systems because soi is compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology or cmos another mainstay of electronics manufacturing used to manufacture computer chips  the new device is said to be highly tunable which means it could enable researchers to overcome manufacturing inconsistencies that are common in nanoscale devices   because of manufacturing differences no two nanoscale devices perform the same rolling off of the assembly line rhoads said   you must be able to tune them after processing which we can do with these devices the heart of the device is a silicon beam attached at two ends  the beam which vibrates in the center like a jump rope is about two microns long and 130 nanometers wide or about 1 000 times thinner than a human hair  applying alternating current to the beam causes it to selectively vibrate side to side or up and down and also allows the beam to be finely adjusted or tuned  the nanoresonators were shown to control their vibration frequencies better than other resonators the devices might replace electronic parts to achieve higher performance and lower power consumption   a vivid example is a tunable filter mohammadi said it is very difficult to make a good tunable filter with transistors inductors and other electronic components but a simple nanomechanical resonator can do the job with much better performance and at a fraction of the power   not only are they more efficient than their electronic counterparts he said but they also are more compact because the devices are tiny and the fabrication has almost a 100 percent yield we can pack millions of these devices in a small chip if we need to mohammadi said   it s too early to know exactly how these will find application in computing but since we can make these tiny mechanical devices as easily as transistors we should be able to mix and match them with each other and also with transistors in order to achieve specific functions  not only can you put them side by side with standard computer and electronic chips but they tend to work with near 100 percent reliability   the new resonators could provide higher performance than previous mems or microelectromechanical systems in sensing application the design enables researchers to precisely measure the frequency of the vibrating beam which changes when a particle lands on it  analyzing this frequency change allows researchers to measure minute masses similar sensors are now used to research fundamental scientific questions  however recent advances may allow for reliable sensing with portable devices opening up a range of potential applications rhoads said  such sensors have promise in detecting and measuring constituents such as certain proteins or dna for biological testing in liquids gases and the air and the nems might find applications in breath analyzers industrial and food processing national security and defense and food and water quality monitoring   the smaller your system the smaller the mass you can measure rhoads said most of the field deployable sensors we ve seen in the past have been based on microscale technologies so this would be hundreds or thousands of times smaller meaning we should eventually be able to measure things that much smaller   the work is based at the dynamic analysis of micro and nanosystems laboratory at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park  other faculty members and graduate students also use the specialized facility the researchers have filed a patent application for the concept  the research is funded by the national science foundation note to journalists an electronic copy of the research paper is available from emil venere 765 494 4709  venere purdue edu abstract lin yu hossein pajouhi molly r nelis jeffrey f rhoads and saeed mohammadi senior member ieee resonant nanoelectromechanical systems nems have the potential to have significant impact in mass sensing signal processing and field detection applications if the challenges associated with processing material and geometric variability can be mitigated  the research presented here details a breakthrough in the design and development of resonant nems aimed at addressing these challenges  specifically the work details the fabrication characterization and tuning of dual gate silicon nanoelectromechanical resonators which are transduced electrostatically and realized with close to 100 yield  these devices are fabricated

aS' new design tool nixes mouse users create shapes with hands only these shapes were produced with handy potter a new design tool developed at the c design lab in purdue s school of mechanical engineering that enables people to create and modify three dimensional objects with their bare hands  the system uses a depth sensing camera and advanced software algorithms to interpret hand movements and gestures purdue university image  download photo west lafayette ind researchers have developed a design tool that enables people to create three dimensional objects with their bare hands by using a depth sensing camera and advanced software algorithms to interpret hand movements and gestures   it allows people to express their ideas rapidly and quickly using hand motions alone said karthik ramani purdue university s donald w  feddersen professor of mechanical engineering we re democratizing the design process you don t have to be an engineer or an accomplished potter to use this  you can be a kid the tool called handy potter represents a potentially significant advance in how people interact with computers he said   in our lab we have a saying the mouse is dead ramani said with handy potter we are trying to make the computer interface natural to the user   his research team won an all conference best paper award for the handy potter work to be presented during the asme 2012 international design engineering technical conferences and computers and information in engineering conference this week in chicago  the paper was co authored by ramani and graduate students vinayak sundar murugappan and cecil piya the research funded by the national science foundation addresses the limitations of conventional computer aided design tools that are needed to create geometric shapes  purdue doctoral student vinayak uses handy potter to create a three dimensional object he is represented by a stick figure as he modifies the shape   purdue university image traditional tools require the use of procedures so complicated that it is difficult to become an expert ramani said   handy potter is more of an imagination tool you create the shape while you are completely focused on the idea rather than bothering yourself about the right usage of the tool  the tool learns you and does not become a barrier in creation you don t learn the tool users interact with a computer using natural user interfaces like hand gestures to create and modify shapes   for example there are very intuitive gestures for pulling and bending a shape ramani said you learn the gestures naturally and without any user manual   the tool could have applications in areas including games architecture art and engineering design it uses the microsoft kinect camera which senses three dimensional space  the camera is found in consumer electronics games that can track a person s body without using handheld electronics researchers created advanced algorithms that recognize the hand understand that the hand is interacting with the shape and then modify the shape in response to the hand interaction   a video showing how the system works is available at https engineering purdue edu cdesign wp p 1221 the algorithms are very intelligent ramani said   they represent state of the art synthesis of machine learning geometric modeling and human computer interaction note to

natural and exploratory shape modeling by introducing novel 3 d interactions for creating modifying and manipulating 3 d shapes using arms and hands  though current design tools provide complex modeling functionality they remain non intuitive and require significant training since they segregate 3 d shapes into hierarchical 2 d inputs thus binding the user to stringent procedural steps and making modifications cumbersome  in addition the designer knows what to design when they go to cad systems and the creative exploration in design is lost we present a shape creation paradigm as an exploration of creative imagination and externalization of shapes particularly in the early phases of design  we integrate the capability of humans to express 3 d shapes via hand arm motions with traditional sweep surface representation to demonstrate rapid exploration of a rich variety of fairly complex 3 d shapes  we track the skeleton of users using the depth data provided by low cost depth sensing camera kinect our modeling tool is configurable to provide a variety of implicit constraints for shape symmetry and resolution based on the position orientation and speed of the arms  intuitive strategies for coarse and fine shape modifications are also proposed we conclusively demonstrate the creation of a wide variety of product concepts and show an average modeling time of only a few seconds while retaining the intuitiveness of communicating the design intent   '

aS' new microtweezers may build tiny mems structures purdue researchers have created a new type of microtweezers capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures print coatings to make advanced sensors and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research   birck nanotechnology center photo west lafayette ind researchers have created new microtweezers capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures print coatings to make advanced sensors and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research  the microtweezers might be used to assemble structures in microelectromechanical systems or mems which contain tiny moving parts  mems accelerometers and gyroscopes currently are being used in commercial products a wider variety of mems devices however could be produced through a manufacturing technology that assembles components like microscopic lego pieces moved individually into place with microtweezers said cagri savran pronounced chary savran an associate professor of mechanical engineering at purdue university   we ve shown how this might be accomplished easily using new compact and user friendly microtweezers to assemble polystyrene spheres into three dimensional shapes he said  research findings were detailed in a paper that appeared online in december in the journal of microelectromechanical systems or jmems  the paper was written by savran mechanical engineering graduate students bin da chan and farrukh mateen electrical and computer engineering graduate student chun li chang and biomedical engineering doctoral student kutay icoz  purdue researchers have created a new type of microtweezers capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures print coatings to make advanced sensors and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research   birck nanotechnology center photo the new tool contains three main parts a thimble knob from a standard micrometer a two pronged tweezer made from silicon and a graphite interface which converts the turning motion of the thimble knob into a pulling and pushing action to open and close the tweezer prongs  no electrical power sources are needed increasing the potential for practical applications other types of microtweezers have been developed and are being used in research  however the new design is simpler both to manufacture and operate savran said the design contains a one piece compliant structure which is springy like a bobby pin or a paperclip  most other microtweezers require features such as hinges or components that move through heat magnetism or electricity complex designs that are expensive to manufacture and relatively difficult to operate in various media he said  the tweezers make it feasible to precisely isolate individual stem cell spheres from culture media and to position them elsewhere  currently these spheres are analyzed in large groups but microtweezers could provide an easy way to study them by individually selecting and placing them onto analytical devices and sensors   we currently are working to weigh single micro particles individually selected among many others which is important because precise measurements of an object s mass reveal key traits making it possible to identify composition and other characteristics savran said   this will now be as easy as selecting and weighing a single melon out of many melons in a supermarket that work is a collaboration with the research group of timothy ratliff the robert wallace miller director of purdue s center for cancer research  the microtweezers also could facilitate the precision printing of chemical or protein dots onto microcantilevers strips of silicon that resemble tiny diving boards  the microcantilevers can be functionalized or coated with certain chemicals or proteins that attract specific molecules and materials  because they vibrate at different frequencies depending on what sticks to the surface they are used to detect chemicals in the air and water  generally microcantilevers are functionalized to detect one type of substance by exposing them to fluids savran said however being able to microprint a sequence of precisely placed dots of different chemicals on each cantilever could make it possible to functionalize a device to detect several substances at once  such a sensing technology also would require a smaller sample size than conventional diagnostic technologies making it especially practical  the new microtweezers are designed to be attached easily to translation stages currently used in research these stages are essentially platforms on which to mount specimens for viewing and manipulating  unlike most other microtweezers the new device is highly compact and portable and can be easily detached from a platform and brought to another lab while still holding a micro size object for study savran said  the two pronged tweezer is micromachined in a laboratory called a clean room with the same techniques used to create microcircuits and computer chips  the research was based at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park note to journalists an electronic copy of the paper is available from emil venere purdue news service at 765 494 4709  venere purdue edu this letter reports a compact versatile and user friendly micromanipulator that uses an elastically deformable silicon microtweezer to grab microentities and a micrometer head for rotational manual actuation  the micro macroconnection is achieved via a graphite interface that results in a compact and portable design and placement on most translation stages  the system which can operate in both air and liquid and transport objects between the two media has a wide range of applications  we demonstrate but a few of them including in situ construction of microstructures in 3 d isolation and placement of individual microparticles on designated spots on sensors on demand microcontact printing of microparticles and manipulation of

aS' new purdue developed mobile app helps identify tropical plants of costa rica could be used to create other note taking apps new purdue developed mobile app helps identify tropical plants of costa rica could be used to create other note taking apps this screenshot taken from the green notes app provides an image and description of the african oil palm which is found in costa rica   purdue news service photo download photo west lafayette ind some pictures may be worth a thousand words but when it comes to plant identification a snapshot rarely tells the full story  purdue agronomist lori unruh snyder is well aware of the spatial and informational limitations of printed materials unruh snyder an assistant professor realized the true limitations of photo sharing when publishing a field guide to tropical plants  the pocket sized book was perfect for field use but many of the supplemental photos and more detailed plant descriptions she d collected through years of research had to be sacrificed for portability  she couldn t find a good digital guide either so she decided to make her own mobile application and she wanted some help unruh snyder partnered with itap technology consultants to create green notes a mobile app that will help students tourists and plant enthusiasts search for and take notes about plants they see  while green notes is specific to plants it s built on a platform that can be used to create other photographic note taking applications in various fields for faculty who are interested in partnering with itap  in addition to providing a digital searchable plant library green notes allows users to contribute to the resource by capturing plant images and sending them to their personal email or to their desired instructor  the app also contains useful information about the foods in the country to help individuals identify risks and benefits of eating certain plants  the app was named green notes because it represents a new way to digitally catolog plants and keep notes in a paperless environmentally friendly way  other key green notes functionalities include auto geotagging of plant locations and a full listing of plant sub properties such as medicinal or holistic uses  the app retails on itunes for 3 99 a fraction of the cost of most plant identification textbooks and is easily portable unlike a heavy textbook  the app currently lists 95 plants with 260 high quality color images and is increasing in size what we re really trying to do is educate the general public on the plants in costa rica and their uses as eco tourism is a huge part of the country unruh snyder says   the application will be very important for tour guides and will help them explain plants to their clients why the plants are seen where they are in the country and what they are used for   to collect data and provide the most relevant and up to date content unruh snyder frequently travels to costa rica she also shares her passion for the country by leading study abroad excursions on sustainable agriculture food systems   many people don t know for example that pineapples grow as a ground dwelling herbaceous fruit and not on a tree that avocados contain a substance that can prevent hair from turning gray or that cashews have been used to treat fever and sweeten breath unruh snyder says   the app is not only a wonderful educational resource but it benefits students in particular by giving them more confidence in their skills to understand and communicate about the plants around them when they re participating in our study abroad trips  my students and i used the green notes app on a daily basis when we visited costa rica this past may having previously partnered with itap on the creation of ifarm an interactive multimedia simulation of agricultural learning modules unruh snyder is a proponent of adopting new technologies into her curriculum to boost student interaction which she believes benefits learning   in many cases a single snapshot of a tree vine or flower looks nothing like the plant in its natural environement so it often stumps my students when they attempt to identify a specimen in the field she says   for students who don t speak spanish green notes also bridges the communication gap by enabling them to communicate through images and provides the common spanish name of which it is called in costa rica  with this technology you can zoom in on a photo to see additional morphological details that are helpful when identifying the plant   moreover unruh snyder has the ability to update the app with new information as it becomes available which costs less and is faster than updating a book  the platform also may be expanded to incorporate plants from other regions and the technology can be applied to field guide material from other faculty  kyle bowen itap s director of informatics who worked with unruh snyder to create green notes encourages faculty to contact him to discuss additional opportunities in bringing mobility and interactivity to the classroom  while several itap developed mobile applications already are available for broad use bowen and his team are interested in working with instructors to develop new teaching technologies   we want to partner with instructors in creating new tools that enhance the learning and teaching experience both within and outside of the classroom   bowen says our students live in a mobile world we can accommodate them by employing technology that students already own and understand while reducing the cost of educational materials and improving student engagement and access to information   '

aS' new purdue efforts focus on brazil west lafayette ind purdue university s global engineering program has launched an initiative to form collaborations with academia and industry in brazil  the initiative included three study abroad courses this summer oriented toward engineering students in addition to two other classes offered in agriculture and language and culture   more than 50 purdue students and eight faculty visited brazil this summer said william anderson director of the global engineering program   this is an important step toward forging our partnerships there central to the initiative was a study abroad course involving 26 students who delved into issues including alternative energy production transportation infrastructure ecology and the environment  the course was developed by monica prezzi and rodrigo salgado both professors of civil engineering the program was very comprehensive in terms of technical content prezzi said   we had university academic and industrial hosts such study abroad efforts benefit the students as well as the local and purdue communities salgado said   any time you can establish or strengthen ties with the fifth largest economy in the world you are going to realize benefits he said   it s beneficial for purdue students and faculty and for local businesses to interact with this dynamic economy and for our students to be able to work there whether permanently or temporarily  at the same time brazil sends thousands of students abroad with full scholarships every year and purdue should make an effort to attract these students   the purdue students visited the itaipu dam and its bio sanctuary created to mitigate the impacts of construction on wildlife and the environment near the border with argentina and paraguay the santa cruz ethanol plant near sao carlos an airline aircraft maintenance facility in sao carlos the university of sao paulo at sao carlos a new subway line construction site in the city of sao paulo a port construction site in the state of rio de janeiro the port of acu superport complex under construction in campos the petrobras research center in rio de janeiro and the graduate program of coppe ufrj a university in rio de janeiro   brazil is a country of important significance in the world and its stature and prominence will only continue to grow both politically and economically said michael a  brzezinski dean of international programs purdue is actively engaging the country through faculty research and now thanks to the college of engineering via student learning opportunities as well   melba crawford interim head of the school of civil engineering and associate dean of engineering for research said all three courses are in areas of strategic interest to the college of engineering   the interdisciplinary course led by prezzi and salgado provided the type of opportunity we strongly endorse for our students to experience multiple aspects of the profession she said  one of the other engineering oriented study abroad courses led by lia stanciu an associate professor of materials engineering focused on the use of biosensors for environmental monitoring in the rainforest  the other course led by anderson focused on the use of remote sensing from satellites and aircraft to study global climate change and the rainforest   the major technical theme of this program was the role of the rainforest in global climatology and how remote sensing is being used to monitor its health anderson said  other topics included forest ecology land use change and the role of indigenous peoples in conservation efforts after a series of lectures and visits with academic researchers and to the brazilian space agency inpe the students spent four days in amazonia for firsthand observations  inez hua a civil engineering professor and global engineering program associate director for latin america is leading a college of engineering initiative to develop research and education collaborations in brazil  hua and nicholas carpita a professor in the department of botany and plant pathology led a purdue delegation to universities industry and government agencies in sao paulo state   our meetings were very productive and i m confident that we ll develop long term collaborations with our university and corporate partners in brazil hua said  prezzi and salgado who are brazilian began developing their study abroad course two years ago and the other two courses were added later   this is something that s natural for us prezzi said being from brazil we have a network of connections there we know the geography and the language we know how institutions and government agencies work we know the university system  this familiarity enables you to provide the best experience possible for the students of the 26 undergraduate students in the brazilian course 12 were women   this is unusual because engineering courses typically have lower percentages of female students salgado said even more interesting is the fact that we have students from a broad representation of engineering disciplines including chemical engineering mechanical engineering industrial engineering and aeronautics and astronautics  there are many opportunities for jobs in a broad range of industries in brazil and there is a well developed university system  our students need to better understand how business and institutions work there this program will help them to establish interactions with other students professors and private industry in brazil   information

aS' new self calibrating mems bringing accuracy to nanotech this picture shows a new device called a self calibratable mems purdue researchers have demonstrated the tiny machines which could make possible super accurate sensors and motors with far reaching applications   purdue university birck nanotechnology center image jason vaughn clark download photo west lafayette ind researchers have demonstrated tiny machines that could make possible super accurate sensors and motors with far reaching applications from computer storage to altimeters detecting petroleum deposits to measuring dna binding forces  the machines are called self calibratable micro electromechanical systems or mems although mems are in commercial use the new device is the first of its kind capable of self calibration a step critical for applications requiring high performance and accuracy said jason vaughn clark an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and mechanical engineering at purdue university   self calibration is needed because each mems device is slightly different due to variations that occur in manufacturing he said   small variations in microstructure geometry stiffness and mass can significantly affect performance because of this variability no two mems behave identically  since conventional methods to measure mems properties are usually impractical expensive have unknown accuracy and large uncertainty enabling mems to calibrate themselves is a game changing innovation   clark previously developed the self calibration theory he and doctoral student fengyuan li have now created the device and conducted experiments to validate the theory  findings are detailed in a paper to appear later this year in the ieee journal of microelectromechanical systems or jmems the peer reviewed work received a grade of a for innovation and an a for importance to the field which testifies to the significance of the research clark said   i think it s important to note that in 1990 mems pioneer richard muller said research on the mechanical properties of the materials in these devices is needed to provide the engineering base that will make it possible to exploit fully this technology he said   and during a 2007 visit to purdue physics nobel laureate john hall said that without accurate and precise measurements no reliable form of science or engineering is possible   the self calibrating technology makes it possible to accurately measure displacement or how far a measuring device moves on a scale of micrometers to less than a nanometer a range that spans a fraction of the diameter of a human hair to a fraction of the width of an atom   the difficulty in accurately measuring small displacements represents a bottleneck in mems and nanotech advancements clark said   accurate metrology is a problem that has eluded researchers since the beginning of mems and nanotech in the late 1980s displacement is fundamental to science and engineering  we know that quantities like velocity acceleration force stiffness frequency and mass can be related to displacement now using a 15 chip that can fit on your fingertip we showed that our technology is able to measure mems displacements better than a 500 000 electron microscope   introducing accurate measurement methods made the difference between alchemy and chemistry about 230 years ago and self calibrating mems might bring a similar transformation in the world if nanotechnology he said   the ability to perform accurate measurements is of paramount importance to technological advancement he said in the late 1700s antoine lavoisier transformed alchemy to chemistry by introducing quantitative measurements  today some compare the state of micro and nanotechnology to alchemy where nanotechnologists can precisely sense small signals but they have not had a practical way to accurately measure most mechanical quantities  that is no two nanotechnology labs have been able to show that they can measure the same phenomenon and obtain the same numerical result   the heart of the self calibrating mems are two gaps of differing size electrostatic sensors and tiny actuators called comb drives so named because they contain meshing comb like fingers  these meshing fingers are drawn toward each other when a voltage is applied and return to their original position when the voltage is turned off  the comb drives measure the change in an electrical property called capacitance while gauging the distances of the two gaps built into the device  the fine measurements reveal the difference between the device s designed layout and the actual dimensions once you learn the difference between layout and fabrication you have calibrated the device clark said   many mems designs with comb drives can be easily modified to implement our technology our research results suggest the days of inaccurate micro and nano mechanical measurements are numbered   mems accelerometers and gyroscopes currently are being used commercially in products such as the nintendo wii video game iphone automobiles the segway human transporter and walking robots  however those mems don t require ultrahigh accuracy like those used in tactical and navigation grade inertial sensors which must undergo a complex calibration procedure in the factory  the chips are tested using machines that translate rotate shock and heat the devices the new self calibratable mems could eliminate or reduce the need for rigorous factory calibration cutting manufacturing costs clark said   something like 30 percent of manufacturing costs are related to calibration the self calibratable mems could lead to high performance data storage technologies and advanced lithography to create next generation computer circuits and nanodevices  researchers will use the new self calibration approach to improve the accuracy of atomic force microscopes or afms which are tools essential for nanotechnologists  purdue operates about 30 afms and clark s research group will use the calibrated mems to calibrate afm displacement stiffness and force  the group also will use a calibrated mems to measure the difference in gravity between different heights above the ground the ability to measure gravity with such sensitivity could be used as a new tool for detecting underground petroleum deposits   conventional gravity meters can cost over 200 000 clark said they consist of a large vacuum tube and a mirrored mass gravitational acceleration is determined by measuring the drop time of the mass in free fall  since oil or mineral deposits have a different density than surrounding material the local gravity is slightly different the bulky and expensive gravity meters could be replaced with a small and inexpensive mems chip  another potential application is as an altimeter for aircraft conventional altimeters measure height by using air pressure which fluctuates   these altimeters aren t really accurate clark said having a sensor that could accurately determine height would be an asset while flying at night through fog or bad weather  the self calibratable technology also could allow mems to recalibrate themselves after being exposed to harsh temperature changes or remaining dormant for long periods  yet another potential application is the study of exotic phenomena such as forces between molecules and within tiny structures on the scale of nanometers   a more accurate mems device could make it possible to measure physical phenomena that have been beyond the resolution of conventional technology clark said   to fully understand and exploit the attributes of the nanoscale you really have to be able to accurately measure subtle phenomena  without accurate measurement tools it becomes difficult to discover or resolve these phenomena to develop accurate physical models and to subsequently use the models to explore possibilities leading to useful innovations   the work is based at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park the research is funded by the national science foundation  writer emil venere 765 494 4709 venere purdue edu note to journalists an electronic copy of the research paper is available from emil venere 765 494 4709  venere purdue edu we present a practical method for measuring planar gaps of mems with comb drives by on chip or off chip electrical probing  we show that our method is practical accurate precise and repeatable the option of on chip postpackaged electrical measurement enables mems to be autonomously self calibratable  we use the measurement of gap to determine the geometrical difference between layout and fabrication which can lead to measurements of other properties such as displacement force stiffness mass etc  our method consists of applying enough voltage to close two unequal gaps and measuring the resulting changes in capacitances many mems designs with comb drives can be easily modified to implement our technology  our results are an order better than convention and suggest means for further improvement '

aS' new system could predict solar flares give advance warning west lafayette ind researchers may have discovered a new method to predict solar flares more than a day before they occur providing advance warning to help protect satellites power grids and astronauts from potentially dangerous radiation  the system works by measuring differences in gamma radiation emitted when atoms in radioactive elements decay or lose energy  this rate of decay is widely believed to be constant but recent findings challenge that long accepted rule the new detection technique is based on a hypothesis that radioactive decay rates are influenced by solar activity possibly streams of subatomic particles called solar neutrinos  this influence can wax and wane due to seasonal changes in the earth s distance from the sun and also during solar flares according to the hypothesis which is supported with data published in a dozen research papers since it was proposed in 2006 said ephraim fischbach a purdue university professor of physics fischbach and jere jenkins a nuclear engineer and director of radiation laboratories in the school of nuclear engineering are leading research to study the phenomenon and possibly develop a new warning system  jenkins monitoring a detector in his lab in 2006 discovered that the decay rate of a radioactive sample changed slightly beginning 39 hours before a large solar flare  since then researchers have been examining similar variation in decay rates before solar flares as well as those resulting from earth s orbit around the sun and changes in solar rotation and activity  the new findings appeared online last week in the journal astroparticle physics it s the first time the same isotope has been used in two different experiments at two different labs and it showed basically the same effect fischbach said  the paper was authored by jenkins and fischbach ohio state university researchers kevin r herminghuysen thomas e blue andrew c  kauffman and joseph w talnagi u s air force researcher daniel javorsek mayo clinic researcher daniel w mundy and stanford university researcher peter a  sturrock data were recorded during routine weekly calibration of an instrument used for radiological safety at ohio state s research reactor  findings showed a clear annual variation in the decay rate of a radioactive isotope called chlorine 36 with the highest rate in january and february and the lowest rate in july and august over a period from july 2005 to june 2011  the new observations support previous work by jenkins and fischbach to develop a method for predicting solar flares advance warning could allow satellite and power grid operators to take steps to minimize impact and astronauts to shield themselves from potentially lethal radiation emitted during solar storms  the findings agree with data previously collected at the brookhaven national laboratory regarding the decay rate of chlorine 36 changes in the decay rate were found to match changes in the earth sun distance and earth s exposure to different parts of the sun itself fischbach said  large solar flares may produce a coronal mass ejection of highly energetic particles which can interact with the earth s magnetosphere triggering geomagnetic storms that sometimes knock out power  the sun s activity is expected to peak over the next year or so as part of an 11 year cycle that could bring strong solar storms  solar storms can be especially devastating if the flare happens to be aimed at the earth hitting the planet directly with powerful charged particles  a huge solar storm called the carrington event hit the earth in 1859 a time when the only electrical infrastructure consisted of telegraph lines   there was so much energy from this solar storm that the telegraph wires were seen glowing and the aurora borealis appeared as far south as cuba fischbach said   because we now have a sophisticated infrastructure of satellites power grids and all sort of electronic systems a storm of this magnitude today would be catastrophic  having a day and a half warning could be really helpful in averting the worst damage satellites for example might be designed so that they could be temporarily shut down and power grids might similarly be safeguarded before the storm arrived   we have repeatedly seen a precursor signal preceding a solar flare fischbach said we think this has predictive value the purdue experimental setup consists of a radioactive source manganese 54 and a gamma radiation detector  as the manganese 54 decays it turns into chromium 54 emitting a gamma ray which is recorded by the detector to measure the decay rate  research findings show evidence that the phenomenon is influenced by the earth s distance from the sun for example decay rates are different in january and july when the earth is closest and farthest from the sun respectively   when the earth is farther away we have fewer solar neutrinos and the decay rate is a little slower jenkins said when we are closer there are more neutrinos and the decay a little faster   neutrinos have the least mass of any known subatomic particle yet it is plausible that they are somehow affecting the decay rate he said  physicist ernest rutherford known as the father of nuclear physics in the 1930s conducted experiments indicating the radioactive decay rate is constant meaning it cannot be altered by external influences   since neutrinos have essentially no mass or charge the idea that they could be interacting with anything is foreign to physics jenkins said   so we are saying something that doesn t interact with anything is changing something that can t be changed either neutrinos are affecting decay rate or perhaps an unknown particle is   jenkins discovered the effect by chance in 2006 when he was watching television coverage of astronauts spacewalking at the international space station  a solar flare had erupted and was thought to possibly pose a threat to the astronauts he decided to check his equipment and discovered that a change in decay rate had preceded the solar flare  further research is needed to confirm the findings and to expand the work using more sensitive equipment he said jenkins and fischbach have previously collaborated with peter sturrock a professor emeritus of applied physics at stanford university and an expert on the inner workings of the sun to examine data collected at brookhaven on the decay rate of radioactive isotopes silicon 32 and chlorine 36 the team reported in 2010 in astroparticle physics that the decay rate for both isotopes varies in a 33 day recurring pattern which they attribute to the rotation rate of the sun s core  the group found evidence of the same annual and 33 day effect in radium 226 data taken at the physikalisch technische bundesanstalt ptb in braunschweig germany and those findings were published in 2011  they also found an additional 154 day recurring pattern in both the brookhaven and ptb data published in 2011 which they believe to be solar related and similar to a known solar effect called a rieger periodicity  note to journalists an electronic

36cl the detector system used was based on a geiger m ller gas detector which is a robust detector system with very low susceptibility to environmental changes  a clear annual variation is evident in

aS'  no sleep energy bugs drain smartphone batteries west lafayette ind researchers have proposed a method to automatically detect a new class of software glitches in smartphones called no sleep energy bugs which can entirely drain batteries while the phones are not in use   these energy bugs are a silent battery killer said y charlie hu a purdue university professor of electrical and computer engineering   a fully charged phone battery can be drained in as little as five hours because conserving battery power is critical for smartphones the industry has adopted an aggressive sleep policy he said   what this means is that smartphones are always in a sleep mode by default when there are no active user interactions such as screen touches every component including the central processor stays off unless an app instructs the operating system to keep it on   for example a mailer may need to automatically update email by checking with the remote server hu said to prevent the phone from going to sleep during such operations smartphone manufacturers make application programming interfaces or apis available to app developers  the developers insert the apis into apps to instruct the phone to stay awake long enough to perform necessary operations app developers have to explicitly juggle different power control apis that are exported from the operating systems of the smartphones hu said   unfortunately programmers are only human they make mistakes when using these apis which leads to software bugs that mishandle power control preventing the phone from engaging the sleep mode  as a result the phone stays awake and drains the battery findings are detailed in a research paper being presented during the 10th international conference on mobile systems applications and services or mobisys 2012 june 25 29 in the united kingdom the paper was written by doctoral students abhinav pathak and abhilash jindal hu and samuel midkiff a purdue professor of electrical and computer engineering  the researchers have completed the first systematic study of the no sleep bugs and have proposed a method for automatically detecting them   we ve had anecdotal evidence concerning these no sleep energy bugs but there has not been any systematic study of them until now midkiff said  the researchers studied 187 android applications that were found to contain android s explicit power control apis called wakelocks   of the 187 apps 42 were found to contain errors or bugs in their wakelock code findings showed the new tool accurately detected all 12 previously known instances of no sleep energy bugs and found 30 new bugs in the apps  the glitch has been found in interactive apps such as phone applications and services for telephony on android that must work even though the user isn t touching the phone  the app may fail to engage the sleep mode after the interactive session is completed you don t see any difference hu said you put it in your pocket and you think everything is fine  you take it out and your battery is dead to detect bugs in the applications the researchers modified a tool called a compiler which translates code written in computer languages into the binary code that computers understand  the tool they developed adds new functionality to the compiler so that it can determine where no sleep bugs might exist the tool analyzes the binary code and automatically and accurately detects the presence of the no sleep bugs midkiff said  the purdue researchers have coined the term power encumbered programming to describe the smartphone energy bugs researchers concentrated on the android smartphone but the same types of bugs appear to affect other brands hu said  the research has been funded in part by the national science foundation

the national laboratory using a similar high performance computer to improve simulations that show a nuclear weapon s performance in precise molecular detail   photo courtesy of lawrence livermore national laboratory download photo west lafayette ind u s researchers are perfecting simulations that show a nuclear weapon s performance in precise molecular detail tools that are becoming critical for national defense because international treaties forbid the detonation of nuclear test weapons  the simulations must be operated on supercomputers containing thousands of processors but doing so has posed reliability and accuracy problems said saurabh bagchi an associate professor in purdue university s school of electrical and computer engineering now researchers at purdue and high performance computing experts at the national nuclear security administration s nnsa lawrence livermore national laboratory have solved several problems hindering the use of the ultra precise simulations  nnsa is the quasi independent agency within the u s department of energy that oversees the nation s nuclear security activities  the simulations which are needed to more efficiently certify nuclear weapons may require 100 000 machines a level of complexity that is essential to accurately show molecular scale reactions taking place over milliseconds or thousandths of a second  the same types of simulations also could be used in areas such as climate modeling and studying the dynamic changes in a protein s shape  such highly complex jobs must be split into many processes that execute in parallel on separate machines in large computer clusters bagchi said   due to natural faults in the execution environment there is a high likelihood that some processing element will have an error during the application s execution resulting in corrupted memory or failed communication between machines bagchi said   there are bottlenecks in terms of communication and computation these errors are compounded as long as the simulation continues to run before the glitch is detected and may cause simulations to stall or crash altogether   we are particularly concerned with errors that corrupt data silently possibly generating incorrect results with no indication that the error has occurred said bronis r  de supinski co leader of the asc application development environment performance team at lawrence livermore errors that significantly reduce system performance are also a major concern since the systems on which the simulations run are very expensive   advanced simulation and computing is the computational arm of nnsa s stockpile stewardship program which ensures the safety security and reliability of the nation s nuclear deterrent without underground testing  new findings will be detailed in a paper to be presented during the annual ieee ifip international conference on dependable systems and networks from june 25 28 in boston  recent research findings were detailed in two papers last year one presented during the ieee supercomputing conference and the other during the international symposium on high performance parallel and distributed computing   you want the system to automatically pinpoint when and in what machine the error took place and also the part of the code that was involved bagchi said   then a developer can come in look at it and fix the problem streaming data to a central server works fine for a hundred machines but it can t keep up when you are streaming data from a thousand machines said purdue doctoral student ignacio laguna who worked with lawrence livermore computer scientists   we ve eliminated this central brain so we no longer have that bottleneck each machine in the supercomputer cluster contains several cores or processors and each core might run one process during simulations  the researchers created an automated method for clustering or grouping the large number of processes into a smaller number of equivalence classes with similar traits  grouping the processes into equivalence classes makes it possible to quickly detect and pinpoint problems the recent breakthrough was to be able to scale up the clustering so that it works with a large supercomputer bagchi said  lawrence livermore computer scientist todd gamblin came up with the scalable clustering approach a lingering bottleneck in using the simulations is related to a procedure called checkpointing or periodically storing data to prevent its loss in case a machine or application crashes  the information is saved in a file called a checkpoint and stored in a parallel system distant from the machines on which the application runs   the problem is that when you scale up to 10 000 machines this parallel file system bogs down bagchi said it s about 10 times too much activity for the system to handle and this mismatch will just become worse because we are continuing to create faster and faster computers   doctoral student tanzima zerin and rudolf eigenmann a professor of electrical and computer engineering along with bagchi led work to develop a method for compressing the checkpoints similar to the compression of data for images   we re beginning to solve the checkpointing problem bagchi said it s not completely solved but we are getting there the checkpointing bottleneck must be solved in order for researchers to create supercomputers capable of exascale computing or 1 000 quadrillion operations per second  the research has been funded by lawrence livermore and the national science foundation the work also involves lawrence livermore scientists greg bronevetsky dong h  ahn martin schulz and ibm austin researcher mootaz elnozahy laguna was awarded a george michael memorial high performance computing fellowship during the supercomputing 2011 conference in recognition of his work on the project  the supercomputing conference paper can be accessed online at ieeexplore or acm digital library or from the research group s home page at https engineering purdue edu dcsl purdue researchers did not work with the actual classified nuclear weapons software code but instead used generic benchmarks a set of programs designed to help evaluate the performance of parallel supercomputers  donald b johnston senior editor press officer lawrence livermore national laboratory 925 423 4902 johnston19 llnl gov enterprise and high performance computing systems are growing extremely large and complex employing many processors and diverse software hardware stacks 1  as these machines grow in scale faults become more frequent and system complexity makes it difficult to detect and diagnose them  the difficulty is particularly large for faults that degrade system performance or cause erratic behavior but do not cause outright crashes  the cost of these errors is high since they significantly reduce system productivity both initially and by time required to resolve them  current system management techniques 2 3 do not work well since they require manual examination of system behavior and do not identify root causes  when a fault is manifested system administrators need timely notification about the type of fault the time period in which it occurred and the processor on which it originated  statistical modeling approaches can accurately characterize normal and abnormal system behavior 4 however the complex effects of system faults are less amenable to these techniques  this paper demonstrates that the complexity of system faults makes traditional classification and clustering algorithms inadequate for characterizing them  we design novel techniques that combine classification algorithms with information on the abnormality of application behavior to improve detection and characterization accuracy significantly  our experiments demonstrate that our techniques can detect and characterize faults with 85 accuracy compared to just 12 accuracy for direct applications of traditional techniques   '

aS' op ed understanding media violence once again the horror of a violent assault has spread around the globe at the speed of light just as the many incidents that preceded it the recent tragedy in aurora colo   has reignited the cultural debate on media violence it is difficult to know to what extent if any the consumption of media messages had to do with the killer s decision to unleash his assault on an unsuspecting movie audience  in response to some voices that react to such assaults by talking about the possible influence of media some others shout back movies don t kill people people kill people   of course this is true and many of those who make this point bristle at the notion that by talking about media influence on behavior the spotlight is redirected away from personal responsibility for one s actions  but we ought to resist feeling forced to choose between a view that emphasizes personal responsibility for behavior and an understanding that the media messages that fill our culture surely have an impact upon us  both are true just as we are all personally responsible for our purchasing decisions we are all responsible for our choice to either refrain from or to engage in violence  but few of us believe that the barrage of commercial messages in our culture have no influence upon us advertisers and researchers know better  similarly we ought to know better than to accept the premise that media violence has no impact on us decades of research clearly establish that media messages have power  the late george gerbner who spent most of his career studying media violence at the university of pennsylvania pointed out that prior to the advent of electronic media the central storytellers of culture were parents educational institutions and the church  the primary motivation for telling those stories was to inspire teach and preserve important values but the structure of electronic media has altered the balance of influence of those traditional sources  today many of the most influential stories that permeate our cultural environment are told by folks who care less about the stories they tell and more about how many stories they can sell  media violence is relatively cheap to produce and speaks in a universal language that is easily exported across cultures to make billions in profits  violence is part of life and to think that it ought never to appear in any of the stories that humans tell is unrealistic we can learn some important lessons from stories that contain violent themes  but today the level of graphic violence being produced for entertainment and commercial profit is completely unprecedented in human history  to think that we can immerse ourselves and our children in this entertainment without being affected by it is absolutely na ve  decades of research show otherwise surely we all have personal responsibility for our actions but just as surely the cultural environment created by the steady stream of media messages that surround us have their impact  viewers who consume large amounts of violence over time are desensitized to it this puts us at risk we ought to be cognizant of both of these truths and attempt to live our lives accordingly striving for the best that we can do for ourselves and for each other  sometimes the best thing to do is to just turn the tv off or change to a different channel glenn g sparks is professor and associate head of the brian lamb school of communication at purdue university  '

aS' pill some day may prevent serious foodborne illness scientist says west lafayette ind modified probiotics the beneficial bacteria touted for their role in digestive health could one day decrease the risk of listeria infection in people with susceptible immune systems according to purdue university research  arun bhunia a professor of food science mary anne amalaradjou a purdue postdoctoral researcher and ok kyung koo a former purdue doctoral student found that the same listeria protein that allows the bacteria to pass through intestinal cells and into bloodstreams can help block those same paths when added to a probiotic   based on the research it looks very promising that we would get a significant reduction in listeria infections said bhunia whose findings were published this month in the journal plos one  bhunia s earlier work showed that listeria triggers intestinal cells to express heat shock protein 60 on their surfaces that allows listeria to bind to the intestinal cells using an adhesion protein and pass into them acting as a sort of gateway to the bloodstream  once in the bloodstream even small doses of listeria can cause fever muscle aches nausea and diarrhea as well as headaches stiff neck confusion loss of balance and convulsions if it spreads to the nervous system  it can also cause abortion and stillbirth in pregnant women according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention it sickens about 1 500 and kills 255 people each year in the united states and primarily affects pregnant women newborns older adults and those with weakened immune systems   we re seeing fewer listeria infections but the severity of those infections is still high amalaradjou said the researchers found that probiotics alone were ineffective in combatting listeria so they stole a trick from the bacteria s own playbook  by adding the listeria adhesion protein to the probiotic lactobacillus paracasei they were able to decrease the number of listeria cells that passed through intestinal cells by 46 percent a significant decrease in the amount of the bacteria that could infect a susceptible person  with the adhesion protein lactobacillus paracasei interacts with heat shock protein on the surface of intestinal cells just as listeria would  the probiotic then attached to the intestinal cells crowding out listeria it s creating a competition bhunia said if listeria comes in it doesn t find a place to attach or invade   bhunia said he could one day foresee the development of a pill or probiotic drink that could be given to at risk patients to minimize the risk of listeria infection  the results came from tests on human intestinal cells the next step would be animal testing bhunia said that would allow him to see whether different doses would have a greater effect  bhunia used funding from the u s department of agriculture in previous work on listeria but the current study was internally funded  recombinant probiotic expressing listeria adhesion protein attenuateslisteria monocytogenes virulence in vitro background listeria monocytogenes an intracellular foodborne pathogen infects immunocompromised hosts  the primary route of transmission is through contaminated food in the gastrointestinal tract it traverses the epithelial barrier through intracellular or paracellular routes  strategies to prevent l monocytogenes entry can potentially minimize infection in high risk populations listeria adhesion protein lap aids l  monocytogenes in crossing epithelial barriers via the paracellular route the use of recombinant probiotic bacteria expressing lap would aid targeted clearance of listeria from the gut and protect high risk populations from infection  methodology principal findings the objective was to investigate the ability of probiotic bacteria or lap expressing recombinant probiotic lactobacillus paracasei lbplap to prevent l  monocytogenes adhesion invasion and transwell based transepithelial translocation in a caco 2 cell culture model several wild type probiotic bacteria showed strong adhesion to caco 2 cells but none effectively prevented l  monocytogenes infection pre exposure to lbplap for 1 4 15 or 24 h significantly p 0 05 reduced adhesion invasion and transepithelial translocation of l  monocytogenes in caco 2 cells whereas pre exposure to parental lb paracasei had no significant effect similarly lbplap pre exposure reduced l  monocytogenes translocation by as much as 46 after 24 h lbplap also prevented l monocytogenes mediated cell damage and compromise of tight junction integrity  furthermore lbplap cells reduced l monocytogenes mediated cell cytotoxicity by 99 8 after 1 h and 79 after 24 h conclusions significance wild type probiotic bacteria were unable to prevent l  monocytogenes infection in vitro in contrast lbplap blocked adhesion invasion and translocation of l monocytogenes by interacting with host cell receptor hsp60 thereby protecting cells from infection  these data show promise for the use of recombinant probiotics in preventing l monocytogenes infection in high risk populations   '

aS' purdue iu health arnett launch colorectal cancer research partnership west lafayette ind purdue university and indiana university health arnett on wednesday sept 12 announced a joint clinical research study on colorectal cancer focused on broadening participation from patients in more rural parts of the state  research teams from the two universities are working with colorectal cancer data to develop tools for helping improve prevention treatment and care of those with cancer  with the clinical data researchers are refining statistical and engineering simulation models to predict how to treat and possibly prevent cancer   this is another terrific example of how great things can happen when iu purdue and the private sector collaborate on a major challenge facing our world in this case colorectal cancer said vic lechtenberg acting executive vice president for academic affairs and provost at purdue   this partnership between iu health arnett and purdue widens the bridge for our scientists and clinicians added dr wael harb director of oncology and research for iu health arnett in lafayette and a partner in the purdue iu research advocacy effort cancer won t be eradicated in a single laboratory by an individual researcher  we all must come together to assist the research that s being done to give doctors the tools they need to better diagnose and treat cancer   this research partnership with a goal to consent 100 cancer patients expands the university led cancer care engineering project which was launched by purdue in partnership with the indiana university melvin and bren simon cancer center in 2006 through 5 million in funding from the u s department of defense the walther cancer foundation and the regenstrief foundation   here in a community setting like lafayette west lafayette that s where 90 percent of cancer patients are treated said marietta harrison associate vice president for research at purdue and director of discovery park s oncological sciences center who is leading the purdue portion of the partnership with iu health arnett since the clinical study gained federal approval on july 31 the cancer study has gained more than a dozen participants  the key to conquering cancer is early detection harrison said a focus of the cancer care engineering project is to discover biomarkers in individual s blood and tissue that will predict susceptibility to colon cancer its early onset and which treatment is most likely to work  this research requires this type of partnership with the medical community and help from local individuals who wish to participate in research studies   partnership with iu health arnett in this clinical trial on colorectal cancer will help our researchers from purdue and iu gather samples that will give us a more complete picture of the progression of cancer in patients harrison said  according to dr harb more than 1 000 drugs designed to treat cancer are in the pipeline but it can take 15 20 years of regulatory hurdles and other steps for a single drug to reach a patient  at the same time 5 percent or fewer of all cancer patients currently participate in clinical trials that percentage must climb if the medical community stands any chance of defeating cancer he said   people are still dying of cancer and that s not acceptable so we need to find answers harb said research is the only way to find a cure for cancer  without research we d have zero chance to treat cancer in conjunction with this partnership purdue and iu simon cancer center received a 500 000 grant from the national institutes of health this spring to launch a regional research advocacy network for educating the public about the role they can play in cancer research the community based project awarded to purdue

advocacy network ran which is a nonprofit organization formed in 2003 to bring together participants in the research process with a focus on educating supporting and connecting patient advocates with the medical research community   we can t change what has already happened but we can make a difference in how cancer is fought for those yet to come said project partner lori miller outreach coordinator for the lafayette based community cancer network in north central indiana   cancer is survivable and we can make it so for more people miller knows that firsthand she has battled three separate cancers in the past decade and today is cancer free  now she spends her time encouraging people to participate in cancer research even those not currently suffering from cancer can help in this cause   without more people participating in these trials drugs that researchers at purdue and elsewhere will not get the approval in time to help people miller said  the cancer care engineering

aS' purdue expert says super bowl ads may not be worth the money west lafayette ind nbc has reported that it sold out advertising time for this year s super bowl broadcast before the end of last year  and 30 second spots sold for a record 3 5 million despite the demand super bowl commercials probably aren t worth the premium prices paid to air them says richard feinberg a consumer psychologist in purdue university s department of consumer sciences and retailing  more than 100 million people are expected to watch the feb 5 super bowl matchup between the new england patriots and new york giants which will be played at lucas oil stadium in indianapolis  when they aren t watching football fans will be entertained by commercials for everything from beer to clothing to cars this year more ads than normal are expected to be longer than the traditional 30 seconds  the problem feinberg says is that repetition is the key to sales and beyond the super bowl some of the commercials don t get much on air play to the specific consumer groups who buy the products and services advertised   since repetition to the right consumer is the foundation of purchases companies just might be better off with 10 350 000 commercials targeted to specific consumers than one 3 5 million commercial targeted to a lot of consumers but not necessarily the right ones he says  research suggests that many viewers like the ads as much or more than the game itself feinberg says while the extra attention further enhances the effect of a 30 second commercial liking an ad doesn t necessarily lead to sales  a study by feinberg suggests that even if people watch the commercials they have a limited impact on longer term memory and if consumers cannot remember the companies or the products the commercials do not lead to sales  he asked 100 consumers who watched the 2010 super bowl to recall details from as many commercials as they could about 30 percent could accurately recall at least one company with a commercial but respondents had low confidence in their memory indicating that they thought that the company had a commercial  few could accurately recall details of the commercials feinberg says the most effective super bowl commercials are connected to a range of social media other advertisements and promotions  the use of animals humor special effects and celebrities increase memorability but that alone does not mean an increase in sales he says   the best commercials tap into helping consumers solve a problem fill a need make them look better feel better or be better the problem with super bowl commercials is that there is so much effort to be creative and cute that the real reason why commercials work is lost and ignored feinberg says   super bowl commercials are celebrated for their creativity and humor but that doesn t guarantee that consumers will become more aware of a product or make a purchase more likely than if the money had been spent in a less expensive but more effective way   source richard feinberg 765 494 8301 xdj1 purdue edu the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration s center of sponsored coastal ocean research funded the research   '

agriculture s outlook for the nation s corn and soybean harvests reflects what farmers have been seeing for the past two months vanishing prospects for a good year as their crops wilt from lack of water  the usda s august crop production report the first projections of how much corn soybean and other crops are expected to produce this year paints a bleak picture as indiana and other eastern corn belt states suffer through the worst drought since at least 1988  in the report released friday aug 10 usda estimated indiana s corn crop would produce 605 million bushels on yields averaging about 100 bushels per acre a per acre decrease of 46 bushels from 2011 and 57 4 bushels from indiana s five year average  soybeans are projected to yield 37 bushels per acre down 8 bushels from last year and 9 7 bushels from the five year average these are remarkably low numbers especially on the corn said chris hurt purdue extension agricultural economist   indiana is the worst of the major production states in terms of corn production we knew that early on it started here and then spread to the west   hurt was among agricultural experts who reviewed the crop production report during a panel discussion at the indiana state fairgrounds  greg matli deputy director of the usda national agricultural statistics service s indiana field office summarized the report which projects that the nation s farmers will produce 10 8 billion bushels of corn  that is down 13 percent from last year which also was not a good crop year because of a less severe drought soybean production is forecast at 2 6 billion bushels down 12 percent from last year  the agriculture industry expected bumper crops in indiana and across the midwest when farmers began planting earlier than normal this spring in what was then favorable weather unseasonable warmth and little rain  there were forecasts that the nation s farmers could produce a corn crop of 14 billion bushels nearly 1 billion more than the previous record if the weather cooperated  this surreal looking soybean field near dayton in tippecanoe county is a victim of the 2012 drought that started in the spring and worsened into the summer   purdue agricultural communication photo tom campbell download photo but conditions soon deteriorated for crops as the heat intensified and fields got hardly any rain at all over the next three months  hopes for a bountiful harvest evaporated as the drought worsened weekly preventing many corn and soybean crops from developing enough to produce strong yields  by the end of the first week of august nearly three fourths of the state s corn crop 73 percent and 53 percent of soybeans were in poor to very poor condition  because of that usda estimates indiana s 2012 corn crop will yield nearly 38 percent below trend yields this is the worst departure from trend yields in indiana in at least 75 years said bob nielsen purdue extension corn specialist  that includes the 1988 corn crop which was down 30 percent from the previous year soybeans were down 20 percent this year indiana s soybean crop still has potential to recover some yield after widespread rains offered much needed relief early this month according to purdue extension soybean specialist shaun casteel   beans are flexible and there is a fair amount of growing season left he said we ve had some rainfall and more mild temperatures in early august and if those continue we can still make up ground   corn on the other hand isn t likely to improve much between now and what is all but certain to be an early harvest we need to be prepared for an early harvest because not only was the crop planted early but it also will mature even faster because of drought stress nielsen said  even with short corn and soybean crops hurt said growers could still find themselves in a profitable situation depending on final yields and crop insurance coverage   we assume producers need bushels to have an income he said corn revenues are up 64 percent from what we expected in the spring and soybean revenues are up 24 percent  some growers might have an opportunity to take advantage of the higher prices crop insurance will be another factor we estimate that 65 75 percent of indiana s corn and soybean acres are insured  those compensation dollars will be very large this year also key in final incomes will be growers marketing and forward contracting strategies and whether farms also include livestock hurt said  this year s devastating drought has brought more attention to farming the difficulties farmers face

agricultural communication photo keith robinson  download photo west lafayette ind indiana farmers and livestock producers still can recover from one of the earliest onslaughts of extremely dry conditions in more than two decades but that time is growing short for some purdue university agricultural experts say  while drought so early in the year is drying out crop fields and forages they say it s not time to hit the panic button yet   clearly there are some truly severely stressed regions of the state said bob nielsen extension corn specialist but if you look at the state as a whole the corn has hung in there amazingly well   corn in indiana will begin a crucial period for its development in late june and the first half of july pollination insufficient water during pollination can significantly reduce the amount of corn the crop produces by harvest in the fall  corn in a few fields in southern indiana already has started to pollinate the big concern now is as we approach pollination statewide nielsen said   we can lose an awful lot of yield potential per day with drought stress during pollination although dryness is not uncommon in indiana in the summer it is unusual for drought to hit in the spring as it did this year soon after farmers planted corn and soybeans annually the state s two biggest crops   it is among the earliest onsets of severe dry weather we ve had in at least the last 25 years or so nielsen said farmers and agricultural economists harken to 1988 when a season long drought devastated crops and to 1991 which also saw major reductions in yield because of drought  while only 37 percent of this year s indiana corn crop was rated good to excellent as of june 17 less than 5 percent of the 1988 crop had that rating by then  yields that year ended up 31 percent below the predicted trend yield for that year in 1991 when drought began later in the growing season about 75 percent of the crop was good to excellent in mid june  but by the first week of august it dropped to below 10 percent leading to a crop that was 27 percent below trend crop condition ratings at this point are nowhere as bad as they were in 1988 nielsen said   that s the good news the bad news is that we re already worse than we were in 1991 nielsen said it was still possible for the corn crop to produce yields close to trend but it would need widespread and timely rains now and for the remainder of the season   we don t want a repeat of 88 and 91 he said it s not a disaster yet we still have opportunities to recover there has been yield loss that we won t recover but i don t think it has been dramatic yield loss   agricultural economist chris hurt estimated that dry conditions already could have trimmed 15 bushels of corn per acre in indiana yields relative to the five year trend and projections from early planting  he projects that farmers could produce about 151 bushels per acre down from his estimate of 166 at the start of the growing season  with indiana being a high production state nationally projected yield losses are beginning to move corn prices upward hurt said  and he added it won t take much more damage before we see the corn market start to really light up hurt projects the potential of indiana soybeans to fall to about 45 bushels per acre down from 49 at the start of the season  soybeans that were planted early in the season in april and early may are faring better than those planted in mid may when the dry spell began said extension specialist shaun casteel  but soybeans that have just barely emerged and look stagnant for several days or longer might not be so bad off that is because beans are putting their energy into developing their roots in these dry conditions rather than their shoots casteel said  although soybeans can withstand dry conditions longer than corn he said bean plants that are severely stressed by drought will produce fewer nodes reducing yield   but beans can compensate casteel said if we get timely rains in july or august we can make up a lot of ground with pod retention and seed size  this is provided those plants are at least sustaining themselves during the current dry period indiana has had less rain than normal because of continued high pressure and lack of moisture from the gulf of mexico the state s primary source of moisture according to the indiana state climate office based at purdue  that has lowered humidity to the point where rain from the west can evaporate before reaching the ground compounding the problem is the insufficient moisture indiana received in the winter said state climatologist dev niyogi   entering the growing season we have low soil moistures and reserves to begin with due to the warm winter and the soil continues evaporating and losing water rapidly niyogi said   the rains we may get in parts can help but planning with drought in mind will be a judicious strategy at this point a storm front packing rain was forecast to move into indiana late this week  aside from that niyogi did not expect much to change in the next couple of weeks with dry areas continuing to get drier so unless storms in coming weeks bring good rains we could be in it for the long haul he said  the low humidity has had a positive effect for livestock producers it makes nights cool helping to reduce heat stress in cows  still producers could face reproductive failures in cows this year because of heat stress said extension beef specialist ron lemenager  he said producers should consider pregnancy checking and marketing cull cows earlier than normal to reduce feed needs and to avoid seasonally lower prices that typically occur october to december   if we don t manage cows correctly this year even though we have higher feed costs calf survival and cow herd reproduction can be compromised in year two which results in less calves marketed in year three he said   unfortunately there are no cheap solutions latest developments in crop

aS' purdue physicists part of discovery of new particle that could be higgs boson purdue university professors ian shipsey and daniela bortoletto stand with edinburgh university professors alan walker and peter higgs at cern  purdue scientists were part of the team of scientists who announced on july 4 the discovery of a new particle that may be the higgs boson  higgs is the professor for whom the particle is named and was the first to suggest the particle as the mechanism that gives mass to matter  pictured from left are walker shipsey higgs bortoletto purdue university photo courtesy of bortoletto download photo west lafayette ind   purdue university scientists were part of a historical event this 4th of july as scientists working on the biggest international experiment in particle physics history announced the discovery of a new particle that may be the long sought higgs boson  purdue s particle physics group has been a part of the more than two decade search for the elusive particle which could confirm the standard model of physics and provide insight into how the universe formed  daniela bortoletto the edward purcell distinguished professor of physics and ian shipsey the julian schwinger distinguished professor of physics attended the announcement at the european organization for nuclear research or cern laboratory in geneva switzerland   on a day where fireworks lit up skies across america the world of science unveiled explosive news concerning the longtime elusive higgs boson particle said shipsey who also is the co coordinator of the large hadron collider physics center at fermilab near chicago and was recently elected chair of the compact muon solenoid collaboration board at cern   more data are needed to establish whether this new particle has all the properties of the standard model higgs boson or whether some do not match which would imply new physics beyond the standard model  either way we ve discovered one more key to unlock the mysteries of the universe the announcement was received with cheers during a joint seminar at cern and the ichep conference in melbourne australia  the results came from experiments using the largest machine ever built by mankind the 27 kilometer long large hadron collider or lhc  superconducting magnets that drive the collider are kept at 1 9 kelvins colder than outer space and billions of protons traveling near the speed of light collide at the world record energy of 8 trillion electron volts  the energy of these collisions transforms into tiny subatomic particles which may never have been seen before and some of which live for only one trillionth of one trillionth of a second  the compact muon solenoid is one of three detectors at the lhc that captures traces of these tiny particles it is in essence a 14 000 ton camera the size of a four story office building that almost completely surrounds one section of the collider and takes up to 40 million pictures every second  purdue scientists and students contributed to the design and construction of several key parts of the cms camera the software used to operate camera and analyze the collisions and have contributed to a variety of key measurements with the data  bortoletto and shipsey led the camera design and assembly teams purdue physics professors virgil barnes and laszlo gutay contributed key design features to two major components of the detector the hadron calorimeters which detect showers of particles coming from high energy quarks and the muon detectors which detect heavy relatives of the electron  bortoletto also is the upgrade coordinator of the u s cms and is responsible for coordinating the 47 u s universities working to upgrade the cms camera  in addition purdue physics professors matthew jones david miller and norbert neumeister are part of the international cms team and 20 other purdue personnel including engineers scientists post doctoral researchers graduate students and undergraduates have participated in the experiment  neumeister with close collaboration from purdue s information technology group also is contributing to the global distributed computing system that analyzed the data from the experiments  the purdue cms tier 2 data storage and processing center is the largest one of its kind among u s universities bortoletto has been involved in several of the analyses searching for the higgs boson and neumeister and shipsey have been involved in the internal reviewing process  higgs bosons if they exist are short lived and quickly decay into other particles because scientists cannot look directly for the particle its discovery relies on observations of excess amounts of the particles into which it can decay  however just as making change for a one dollar bill can be done using different combinations of coins higgs bosons can decay into different combinations of particles  bortoletto s group looked for evidence of specific subatomic particles that would result from one possible decay of a higgs boson  an illustration of a particle collision measured by the cms detector image courtesy of cern download photo to avoid any possible bias while analyzing new data and ensure objectivity when looking for much sought after signs of new physics physicists draw blinds over the region where an excess of decay events is expected bortoletto said  this region is only unblinded when they are satisfied enough with their procedures to give confidence in the ultimate result   the moment the analysis was unblinded was amazing bortoletto said the excess at 125 3 gev was easy to see and we felt as though a major discovery was appearing in front of us  the statistical significance achieved was enough to be classified as a discovery the probability of the background alone fluctuating by this amount is one in three million   cms reported observations consistent with expectations for the standard model higgs boson the results were found with a statistical significance of 4 9 sigma a unit of standard deviation which means scientists are 99 99997 percent certain of the discovery  the standard model of particle physics describes the basic building blocks of matter and their interactions and its explanations of elementary particles and forces have held true through more than four decades of experimental testing  the higgs boson remains the only missing piece of the model and without it the critical component of how these particles obtain mass cannot be explained   the standard model higgs would tidily complete the standard model of particles and forces barnes said however the very precise and successful standard model does not explain all that we have observed   it does not give us guidance on how to unify gravity with the other known forces of nature explain why there are exactly three pairs of quarks and three generations of leptons or explain why the third generations are some ten thousand times heavier than the first generations he said   there are some very appealing theories involving a whole host of new particles some of which we are really hoping to find at the lhc barnes said   it is not impossible that our new particle could be for example one of the postulated supersymmetric higgses the higgs boson is named after peter higgs a professor of physics at the university of edinburgh who first suggested the particle as the mechanism that gives mass to matter  shipsey was a graduate student at the university of edinburgh and attended classes taught by higgs this announcement was the first time shipsey had seen higgs in 20 years   peter was a brilliant teacher and all the students were in awe of him shipsey said however he is an extremely modest person and is somewhat embarrassed that the particle carries his name  it was wonderful to see him again and share this moment with him the lhc continues to deliver new data at an impressive rate by the end of 2012 cms hopes to have more than triple its total current data sample  these data will enable cms to further elucidate the nature of this newly observed particle they will also allow cms to extend the reach of their many other searches for new physics bortoletto said  sources ian shipsey 765 409 2979 shipsey purdue edu skype ian shipseydaniela bortoletto cern 011 41 76 487 8773 bortolet purdue edu

aS' purdue president to graduates seek opportunities embrace change west lafayette ind congratulations graduates this is a special day for you for your families and friends and for all of us at purdue who have watched you grow your skills experience confidence and aspirations during your time here  college is indeed a time of transformation if you don t think you ve changed that much just ask your families i m sure they ve marveled at how you ve developed intellectually and socially since they waved good bye and drove away from campus that first year  for those of you who are earning your baccalaureate degrees this summer your earliest days at purdue may seem long ago you probably sat in this same hall at boiler gold rush wondering whether you would be able to fulfill the rigors of college and meet the high standard of excellence that is purdue  the anxious young freshmen who sat here several years ago have grown and today we celebrate as you become the future leaders of our communities and corporations of our academic institutions and our government agencies  we also commemorate our proud graduate students whose hard work has earned them master s doctorate and professional degrees you came here wondering if you could be the great thinkers that your advisers wanted you to be could you keep up with your peers  what if they found out what you were really like i think nearly every student goes through the imposter syndrome for at least a little while  but the purdue experience has changed you too you ve mastered your chosen areas of study you ve created new knowledge made significant advancements through your research and helped design useful tools that will assist others  emily cook has earned a master of science in biomedical engineering her work at purdue will help amputees control their prosthetic devices through a miniaturized radio frequency powered implantable electrode that speaks to targeted muscle sites  arthur chlebowski also in biomedical engineering has earned a doctor of philosophy degree he has designed a device that one day may continuously monitor the intraocular pressure of the eye  this will give ophthalmologists better tools for diagnosing and monitoring patients with glaucoma a disease that is expected to affect nearly 80 million people worldwide over the next 10 years  among you may be a best selling novelist a hotel manager an inspirational teacher a compassionate nurse a cyberforensics genius or a crop scientist who will help farmers around the world gain greater yields from land that struggles to produce  all of our graduates today have learned new levels of confidence independence and responsibility these leadership skills weren t all gained in the classroom  many were learned in the organizations you joined the athletic teams you participated in and the volunteer time you gave to our community  your confidence also came from the enduring love and support of your friends and family let s bring up the house lights so you can wave to your parents siblings grandparents and friends and thank them for all they ve done for you during your purdue years  some of you may have noticed that i ve been through a few changes of my own lately less than a month ago i was provost sands today i am honored to be entrusted with the responsibility of acting president for this extraordinary institution  i ve also been an undergraduate a graduate student an industrial researcher a professor a graduate student adviser in fact two of my students are receiving their doctoral hoods today a research center director and perhaps my most important role the parent of college students all boilermakers by the way two graduated two still here  as i ve moved through the changes of each new role i ve picked up a few tips that i d like to share with you on this special day  you have been taught and mentored by some of the finest faculty in the world internalize the skills and traits that you found effective in them and apply them to your own life  whether you are going on to a faculty position at another university starting a company or joining a fortune 500 corporation you can always draw useful information from the people around you  i encourage you to watch and learn from others who are more experienced and remember someday young people will be learning from you  the researchers in the audience know what i m talking about when i say that sometimes you need to be very patient before you re able to reach your ultimate goal  when it comes to your career it may take a while before you find work that interests you fully the bureau of labor statistics reports that the average person born in the latter years of the baby boom that s 1957 to 1964 held 11 jobs from ages 18 44  that s 11 jobs in 26 years that s a lot of changing and a lot of opportunities we expect that your generation will change jobs just as much if not more  but although change is sometimes tough or even scary every new position can be viewed as a step closer to something you really want to do or an opportunity to make a greater impact  you might graduate from a college that begins with for example the letter p then you might go on to earn a law degree and become a corporate leader somewhere in indiana  perhaps then you ll lead a federal government agency and work for the president of the united states you might go from there to become the governor of a great midwestern state maybe even indiana again  and then who knows someday you might even end up as the president of another university with a name that coincidentally also begins with the letter p and happens to be the greatest institution in the entire country  it could really happen through your life each step over time will lead you closer to something you will love to do something you were meant to do something that will make a bigger difference  be patient and seek the opportunities as they present themselves and when a door opens for you and your immediate reaction is the opportunity is too early too much of a jump or not in the original plan think twice before saying no thanks   don t be afraid to jump in over your head repeatedly it leads to personal growth it helps you refine what type of person you want to be and what you want to do with your career  it often leads to more money or you might even discover that money is not a major criterion for you after all maybe for you it is autonomy or a sense of higher purpose or the opportunity to master your field  and there is something else that is good about change it is something you can count on it will be a constant in your life but as you do remember one thing no matter how many cities you live in or positions you hold or how many times you completely change careers one thing will never change   '

in the school of veterinary medicine and associate director of discovery groups for the purdue center for cancer research also will deliver a keynote lecture on international efforts to prevent breast cancer development to a panel of african health and public policy experts on monday jan  16 in kumasi the incidence of breast cancer has risen rapidly in many african countries and the world health organization is asking scientists from around the world to help shift efforts from detection toward primary prevention said leli vre pronounced le lee yea vre   that s because many developing countries will not be able to withstand the costs associated with the necessary heavy treatments especially since women usually consult at advanced stages of the disease   leli vre and gruenbaum with support from the purdue global policy research institute are researching how legal and cultural aspects impact policy decisions in terms of breast health in countries such as ghana lebanon france japan and uruguay  gruenbaum a medical anthropologist and head of the department of anthropology also will work on establishing a collaboration to study cultural and religious practices affecting breast health and dietary patterns   many african women are dying from breast cancer mainly because of a lack of understanding about the disease s early symptoms and beliefs about the effects of breast cancer gruenbaum said   while the country s fatality rate from breast cancer is 10th highest in africa ghanaian health care officials and government leaders are working aggressively to raise awareness and educate women about how lives can be saved from early screening and treatment   during their visit to ghana leli vre and gruenbaum will meet with african breast cancer awareness leader

and ghana as well as france japan uruguay and lebanon  through the project launched in 2010 each country has a dedicated research team focused on a number of milestones and allows scientists to study worldwide diversity in breast cancer rates dietary patterns and cultural contexts  the project is bringing together experts in nutrition basic medical sciences statistics cancer epidemiology communication public policy economics health law anthropology and medicine to study a variety of factors such as how cellular mechanisms in breast cancer development link to diet as well as the role public policy plays in a population s available food source and disease prevention  leli vre said another important objective is to identify the link between different types of breast cancer nutrition and the epigenome the latter of which determines how the genome is organized within cells to control the on and off switch of genes  the ibcn s annual conference returns to the purdue campus this fall following the 2011 event in france lebanon is scheduled to host the conference in 2013  purdue hosted the inaugural conference in october 2010 purdue s global policy research institute focuses on the

aS' purdue researcher helps robots see in 3 d like humans zygmunt pizlo purdue professor in the department of psychological sciences stands between postdoctoral research assistants tadamasa sawada and yunfeng li as he adjusts the vision of a robot named 268 apek  the researchers will move around the dance floor in pizlo s laboratory while the robot watches the goal is to stimulate visual perception in the robot so it can see more like humans   photo provided by purdue research foundation west lafayette ind zygmunt pizlo and his research team glide across a parquet dance floor not in some club for a night on the town but in his purdue university visual perception lab as part of critical research for a technology that is ready to be licensed and commercialized they re moving so a robot named 268 apek can watch them and conceptualize the research team s actions as members move around objects like desks and chairs  the goal is to simulate visual perception in the robot so it can see more like humans enabling robots and other machines to see the world in 3 d like humans is one of the biggest challenges in robotics and artificial intelligence said pizlo a professor in the purdue department of psychological sciences   research in the field of robotic vision has typically focused on recording and analyzing 2 d images but really it is about 3 d visual perception being able to understand the 3 d scene in front of the robot so that it can decide what needs to be done with an object that is in its field of view  should the robot walk around it pick it up we believe there is a fundamental principle for human vision and that is we rely on a prior knowledge about a physical environment so we re trying to program this knowledge of the physical environment into a robot s artificial intelligence he said   we re developing a technology that will allow robotic machines to map their environment using two cameras for eyes he said this process eliminates the need for additional range sensors currently used for robotic vision and reduces the time and complexity of robotic sight   postdoctoral research assistants tadamasa sawada and yunfeng li are working with pizlo sawada said humans have the ability for cognitive functions that are computationally difficult and it is a challenge to incorporate that ability into a robot  view of zygmunt pizlo purdue professor in the department of psychological sciences and postdoctoral research assistants tadamasa sawada and yunfeng li demonstrating how a robot sees them moving across a dance floor in pizlo s laboratory   photo provided by purdue research foundation we quickly and easily perceive the physical world a 3 d shape and figure ground organization sawada said   figure ground organization is key to seeing an object in 3 d instead of 2 d figure ground perception is the tendency of a human s visual system to simplify a scene or photo into a main object and cognitively move everything else into the background   the question is how do we have a robot solve figure ground organization like we do he said we do this by incorporating visual mechanisms and a prior knowledge about the physical environment into a robot   conventional robotic vision technology uses multiple cameras with laser range finders and other sensors to detect objects around them  while the current systems allow for basic object recognition they do not replicate the 3 d capabilities that are possible for humans according to pizlo   the key element in solving the puzzle of enabling 3 d vision for robots is to realize that our visual system uses a prior knowledge about the physical world  we are implementing this knowledge as well as the visual mechanisms algorithms in a robot said pizlo who also is a professor of electrical and computer engineering   the physical world is not completely random most natural objects are symmetrical all objects have volume gravity is always present ground surfaces are approximately horizontal  there is enough prior knowledge in the human visual system that we automatically see everything in 3 d combining a prior knowledge with visual information helps robots see the same way we do   right now robots are used in a number of ways including manufacturing space research agriculture and even cleaning our floors but they can t bring us coffee in the morning he said   until they can see like us they can t truly interact with us once they can interact with us they can begin doing all types of tasks such as drive a car help surgeons in hospitals assist the elderly provide sight for the blind replace people in high risk situations like making repairs in a nuclear plant and yes bring us coffee in the morning   the patent pending technology is available

rolling out the first initiative of its decadal funding plan with the announcement on wednesday jan  11 that it will proceed with the first steps toward a balanced trimester the trimester is an effort designed to enhance students academic opportunities as well as help them move more quickly toward graduation  president france a c rdova during the announcement at the lumina foundation headquarters said that the balanced trimester initiative is one of several to be unveiled over the next few months in the decadal planning process  purdue s decadal funding plan is a long term commitment to help offset declining state appropriations and reduce tuition increases   we have spent a lot of time thinking through the various elements of the 10 year funding plan she said now that we better understand the costs and returns involved it s time to put these initiatives in motion   beginning this summer the university will expand its summer program offerings as a first step toward implementing a full summer trimester   purdue has moved boldly to become more productive affordable and supportive of students more quickly completing their degrees said indiana gov  mitch daniels this is how leaders act offering a third semester each year will help some students complete a nominal four year degree in as little as three years saving them time and money and it will give others the chance to take advantage of study abroad and internship opportunities  when fully implemented the trimester initiative could mean 40 million in additional revenue for the university and would make better use of classrooms residence halls and other campus facilities during the summer months   this initiative will make a purdue education more affordable because a greater array of summer course and program offerings combined with discounted summer tuition will result in a faster time to completion for some students said tim sands provost and executive vice president for academic affairs  purdue s fall and spring tuition schedule for the main campus in west lafayette is already designed to encourage full course loads by offering credits above eight for no additional charge  in addition students taking from eight to 16 credits in the summer receive a discount relative to fall and spring rates that discount is as high as 50 percent for students who take eight or nine credits in the summer  in embarking on this more aggressive efficiency and opportunity initiative purdue is exploring ideas for further incentives course packages and scholarships along with financial models that encourage departments to implement summer academic programs to jump start the trimester initiative  purdue president france a c rdova speaks wednesday jan 11 during an indianapolis news conference at the lumina foundation to announce the university will proceed with the first steps toward a balanced trimester   purdue university photo mark simons download photo purdue s decision to move toward a full summer trimester offers students expanded opportunities to accelerate graduation and save money and is aligned with the commission s goals of increasing completion and ensuring affordability said teresa lubbers indiana commissioner for higher education  jamie merisotis lumina foundation president and ceo said lumina foundation is honored to host the announcement of purdue s new trimester effort  we applaud purdue university and president c rdova s plan to accelerate the time to degree this is an innovative approach and reflects a strong commitment to serving students and the state of indiana   the project is a key part of the decadal funding plan to increase sources of revenue beyond tuition and state appropriations the traditional sources for public university funding by doubling revenue capacity through continued cost cutting expanding online degree and professional education offerings encouraging more robust use of campus facilities through summer teaching and learning and ramping up research commercialization  purdue trustee joann brouillette said the trimester effort was attractive to trustees because it would benefit students and the university s bottom line   the advantages for students are several and it helps the university financially while making better use of buildings and equipment she said   the additional revenue will help cut our cost per credit hour c rdova said we ve made a commitment to students and the state legislature that purdue will do everything possible to keep tuition affordable and still deliver an exceptional education and a valuable degree   currently 6 000 students take summer classes at purdue s main campus for an average of four to five credit hours each the goal is to grow the summer trimester to more than 20 000 students by 2022  although savings for students and the institution would accrue from year round utilization of facilities expenses also would grow with additional pay needed for professors and support staff  financial aid also would need attention since most programs typically cover only two semesters in an academic year one option for additional indiana student support will be purdue s indiana challenge scholarship program  c rdova announced this summer that 7 million earned through university investments would be used to boost private donations for student support with 300 000 dedicated to support veterans and their dependents and 6 7 million for the scholarship matching program  the purdue indiana challenge match will contribute to the access and success student scholarship and programming

aS' rap music powers rhythmic action of medical sensor this graphic illustrates the principles behind the operation of a new type of miniature medical sensor powered by acoustic waves including those found in music such as rap blues jazz and rock  the device a pressure sensor might ultimately help to treat people stricken with aneurisms or incontinence due to paralysis birck nanotechnology center purdue university  download photo west lafayette ind the driving bass rhythm of rap music can be harnessed to power a new type of miniature medical sensor designed to be implanted in the body  acoustic waves from music particularly rap were found to effectively recharge the pressure sensor such a device might ultimately help to treat people stricken with aneurisms or incontinence due to paralysis  the heart of the sensor is a vibrating cantilever a thin beam attached at one end like a miniature diving board music within a certain range of frequencies from 200 500 hertz causes the cantilever to vibrate generating electricity and storing a charge in a capacitor said babak ziaie a purdue university professor of electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering   the music reaches the correct frequency only at certain times for example when there is a strong bass component he said the acoustic energy from the music can pass through body tissue causing the cantilever to vibrate   when the frequency falls outside of the proper range the cantilever stops vibrating automatically sending the electrical charge to the sensor which takes a pressure reading and transmits data as radio signals  because the frequency is continually changing according to the rhythm of a musical composition the sensor can be induced to repeatedly alternate intervals of storing charge and transmitting data   you would only need to do this for a couple of minutes every hour or so to monitor either blood pressure or pressure of urine in the bladder ziaie said   it doesn t take long to do the measurement findings are detailed in a paper to be presented during the ieee mems conference which will be jan  29 to feb 2 in paris the paper was written by doctoral student albert kim research scientist teimour maleki and ziaie researchers have created a new type of miniature pressure sensor shown here designed to be implanted in the body  acoustic waves from music or plain tones drive a vibrating device called a cantilever generating a charge to power the sensor birck nanotechnology center purdue university  download photo this paper demonstrates the feasibility of the concept he said the device is an example of a microelectromechanical system or mems and was created in the birck nanotechnology center at the university s discovery park  the cantilever beam is made from a ceramic material called lead zirconate titanate or pzt which is piezoelectric meaning it generates electricity when compressed  the sensor is about 2 centimeters long researchers tested the device in a water filled balloon a receiver that picks up the data from the sensor could be placed several inches from the patient  playing tones within a certain frequency range also can be used instead of music but a plain tone is a very annoying sound ziaie said   we thought it would be novel and also more aesthetically pleasing to use music researchers experimented with four types of music rap blues jazz and rock   rap is the best because it contains a lot of low frequency sound notably the bass ziaie said the sensor is capable of monitoring pressure in the urinary bladder and in the sack of a blood vessel damaged by an aneurism  such a technology could be used in a system for treating incontinence in people with paralysis by checking bladder pressure and stimulating the spinal cord to close the sphincter that controls urine flow from the bladder  more immediately it could be used to diagnose incontinence the conventional diagnostic method now is to insert a probe with a catheter which must be in place for several hours while the patient remains at the hospital   a wireless implantable device could be inserted and left in place allowing the patient to go home while the pressure is monitored ziaie said  the new technology offers potential benefits over conventional implantable devices which either use batteries or receive power through a property called inductance which uses coils on the device and an external transmitter  both approaches have downsides batteries have to be replaced periodically and data are difficult to retrieve from devices that use inductance coils on the implanted device and an external receiver must be lined up precisely and they can only be about a centimeter apart  a patent application has been filed for the design

and implementation of a novel electromechanical energy scavenging and wireless interrogation scheme using low frequency components of musical vibrations to overcome challenges associated with previously reported passive transponders such as short transmission range misalignment sensitivity and complicated receiver circuitry  the transponder has two phases of operation 1 mechanical vibration phase in which an acoustic receiver a piezoelectric cantilever converts the sound vibration into electrical power and charges a capacitor and 2 electrical radiation phase in which the stored charge is dumped into an lc tank forcing it to oscillate at its natural resonance frequency and emitting the energy to an outside receiver  in a pressure sensing configuration the distance between a planar coil and a ferrite core is modulated by the pressure thus changing the inductance and in turn inducing a change in the frequency of the emitted signal  a prototype transponder was built and tested using a pzt cantilever with a mechanical resonant frequency of 435 hz encapsulated in a glass capsule length 40 mm diameter 8 mm along with a rectifier circuitry and a storage capacitor  the inductive pressure sensor located outside the capsule had a sensitivity of 2 5k hz kpa we were able to easily pick up the transmitted rf pulses at distances of up to 7 cm without the tight requirement on alignment between the receiver and the transponder coils   '

aS' rapidly cooling eggs can double shelf life decrease risk of illness kevin keener developed a rapid egg cooling system that uses circulated carbon dioxide to create a thin layer of ice inside an egg s shell that cools the inside of an egg within minutes strengthening proteins and increasing shelf life   purdue agricultural communication file photo keith robinson west lafayette ind taking just a few seconds to cool freshly laid eggs would add weeks to their shelf life according to a purdue university study  the rapid cooling process developed by kevin keener a professor of food science uses liquid carbon dioxide to stabilize the proteins in egg whites so much that they could be rated aa the highest grade for eggs for 12 weeks  earlier research showed that the same cooling technology could significantly reduce occurrences of salmonella illnesses there is no statistical difference in quality between eggs as measured by haugh units just after laying and rapidly cooled eggs at 12 weeks he said   this rapid cooling process can provide a significant extension in the shelf life of eggs compared to traditional processing keener s results published in the journal poultry science also show that membranes surrounding the eggs yolks were maintained for 12 weeks when eggs were rapidly cooled  that membrane is a barrier that keeps harmful bacteria from reaching the yolk a nutrient rich reservoir that bacteria could use as a food source   the structural integrity of the yolk membrane stays strong longer which may provide a food safety benefit he said the membrane being stronger would be another defense against bacterial invasion such as salmonella   the rapid cooling technology takes liquid carbon dioxide and turns it into a snow to rapidly lower the eggs temperature eggs are placed in a cooling chamber and carbon dioxide gas at about minus 110 degrees fahrenheit is generated  the cold gas is circulated around the eggs and forms a thin layer of ice inside the eggshell after treatment the ice layer melts and quickly lowers an egg s internal temperature to below 45 degrees the temperature at which salmonella can no longer grow  keener s previous research showed that the carbon dioxide in bicarbonate form significantly increases the activity of lysozyme an enzyme in the egg white that has bactericidal properties  traditionally eggs are at more than 100 degrees when placed into a carton thirty dozen eggs are then packed in a case and 30 cases are stacked onto pallets and placed in refrigerated coolers  the eggs in the middle of the pallet can take up to 142 hours nearly six days to cool to 45 degrees keener said keener said a 2005 u s  government report showed that if eggs were cooled and stored at 45 degrees within 12 hours of laying there would be about 100 000 fewer salmonella illnesses from eggs in the nation each year  rapid cooling could also increase the ability to export eggs to places where this isn t possible today you could send eggs anywhere in the world if you could get even eight weeks of shelf life at aa quality  we re seeing 12 weeks keener said right now you can t ship eggs anywhere in the world and expect to retain that quality keener said with additional funding he would continue to study the benefits of rapid cooling including inoculating the inside of shell eggs with salmonella and examining how other proteins in the whites and yolks of eggs are affected  keener is a technical consultant to the american egg board and a member of the united egg producers scientific advisory panel his work was funded by purdue and gift funds  maximizing carbon dioxide content of shell eggs by rapid cooling treatment and its effect on shell egg quality rapid cooling of shell eggs using liquid co 2 has been shown to cool eggs to 7 c within minutes as opposed to days required by traditional cooling treatments this quick cooling technique is component in the maintenance of egg quality and extended shelf life beyond the current 30 45 d period  the hypothesis for the current study was that maximizing co2 content of the eggs during cooling may increase haugh units and thus extend shelf life physical quality factors  the objective of this study was to maximize co2 content of shell eggs during rapid cooling with liquid co2 and determine its effect on egg quality during 12 wk of refrigerated storage  three cooling conditions selected for the study were 45 c for 18 min treatment a 60 c for 15 min treatment b and 75 c for 12 min treatment c  after rapid cooling treatment it took approximately 25 min for the internal temperature of eggs to equilibrate to 7 c the haugh units of the rapidly cooled eggs were significantly higher than the traditionally cooled control eggs  after 12 wk of refrigerated 5 7 c storage control eggs were only 37 aa grade 57 a grade and 6 b grade in comparison all the rapidly cooled eggs averaged to 80 aa grade and 20 a grade  after 6 wk the average quality of control eggs reduced to grade a whereas rapid cooling treatment was able to maintain aa quality up to 12 wk  the co2 content of the rapidly cooled eggs 1 8 mg of co2 g of albumen showed no difference between treatments a b and c but it was significantly higher than the control 1 3 mg of co 2 g of albumen in addition the vitelline membrane strength of the control decreased 65 during storage and was between 30 and 50 of the vitelline membrane strength of co 2 cooled eggs at 12 wk rapid cooling with liquid co2 extends shelf life of shell eggs '

aS' reduced cattle herd could mean bigger profits starting late 2013 west lafayette ind the u s beef herd has been shrinking and the worst drought in decades has only encouraged that trend to continue  but for beef producers who can withstand the financial hardship over the next several months reduced beef supplies could mean bigger profits starting as early as late 2013  the u s department of agriculture s midyear cattle inventory report showed beef cow numbers dropped by 3 percent in the last year  it projects the 2012 calf crop to be down 2 percent from last year and down 8 percent since 2006 part of what has been driving the decline is skyrocketing feed costs and prolonged drought in the southern plains said chris hurt purdue extension agricultural economist   this year s drought likely means further decreases in cow numbers over the next 12 14 months he said the impacts of the drought are just beginning to show up in some of the national data  we do know the direction but not the final magnitude since mid june corn prices have jumped by 60 percent and soybean meal prices by 25 percent  and according to the usda 82 92 percent of the pastures in indiana illinois arkansas missouri iowa kansas nebraska and colorado are in very poor or poor condition  the lack of available feed crops and forages and the high prices for what is available have forced many producers to start culling their herds  as more cattle have entered the market the value of calves and feeder cattle has fallen in the wake of high feed prices and uncertainty regarding forage availability calf and feeder cattle prices plummeted hurt said  for example oklahoma steer calf prices were 173 per hundredweight in mid june but fell to 138 in late july a 35 per hundredweight decline on a 550 pound calf is a nearly 200 per head value reduction   multiplying that across a national calf crop of 34 5 million head totals a potential decline in value of nearly 7 billion he said   it is still too early to count the actual damages but this illustration shows it s likely large the silver lining hurt said could be for producers who are able to weather the financial storm and hold onto their herds  as cattle numbers fall below beef consumer demand prices should rebound producers likely best positioned to keep their herds are those who locked in lower feed prices in the spring  that would mostly include large feedlots that tend to hedge on feed and feed cost and profit margins the message for cow calf producers is to hold onto the cows if possible hurt said   the short term losses of the next 12 to 14 months will be replaced by large profits in late 2013 2014 and 2015 hurt said the anticipated golden days are based on reductions in per capita beef supplies leading to higher retail beef prices and an expected return to more normal crop conditions in 2013  while that could revive some optimism in the cattle industry hurt was quick to point out that most thoughts of herd expansion would be pushed off until late 2013   the exception is for producers in areas of the country that have abundant forages he said for them buying cows sold this fall from distressed owners appears to be a strategic move   '

medications insulin and cancer treatments  today an estimated 2 million infusion pumps are in hospitals and clinics and thousands more are used by patients in their homes  the pumps come with a programmable computer to control the rate and volume of medication flow which can vary depending on the patient s illness weight age and other factors  a doctor nurse or other health care worker enters information on the infusion pump s keypad despite their advantages the fda reports that infusion pumps were linked to more than 56 000 adverse event reports from 2005 2009 including at least 500 deaths  cindy gaston senior clinical pharmacist for the university of wisconsin hospital clinics in madison says the purdue led community has been helpful in sparking discussion from hospital personnel in different environments who have diverse experiences and different vantage points   we re all human and we make mistakes gaston says when we re programming numbers into a pump we can make an error many times those errors won t cause patient harm but it can be one or two times that it does cause severe patient harm ultimately resulting in death   if we can prevent those deaths and improve our use of infusion pumps it s a very worthwhile project that purdue is leading in 2010 the u s  food and drug administration released guidelines designed to improve safety as part of its infusion pump improvement initiative which proposed stricter regulation of pumps and cited software defects user interface issues and mechanical or electrical failures as main causes of adverse events  infusion pump manufacturers say most problems stem from a nurse or health care worker accidentally entering the wrong data but the fda and hospital officials say the deaths and injuries were because of engineering and design defects of the devices  that was the driving force behind regenstrief s efforts to create the group to examine the problems with smart pumps and find solutions  beverly vermace parental infusion device coordinator and a registered nurse at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics says the purdue network has allowed her hospital system to work through existing hurdles encountered with the use of smart pumps while being proactive in avoiding potential hurdles learned from other hospitals   with all health care technology we cannot remove the human element vermace says technology needs to be designed to allow the clinician to do safe patient care  when that happens patient outcomes will improve a team led by ann christine catlin a research scientist in

tutorials q a forums and other educational and research resources all accessible via a web page  jim young quality assurance process improvement pharmacist at wishard says that through the group led by purdue hospitals can share individual processes for getting a better understanding about how to set guidelines and limits for dosages and concentrations of medication  young whose hospital system began using wireless infusion pumps in 2010 says pharmacists can learn a lot about their proper use by talking to the nurses and vice versa   the interaction with this community is helping us improve that communication process to make sure we can give our patients the best possible care he says   we re writing the textbook here through the interactions with this community of hospitals vermace at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics says the community also provides a form of encouragement for hospital administrators and staff who know other hospitals have similar issues and are committed to find solutions   we get good ideas such as what has worked from the lessons learned why pharmacists and nurses must work together more effectively she says   another advantage is the rapid response to questions asked and immediate contact with people with a shared experience kathy rapala is now vice president of clinical risk management at aurora health care in wisconsin  she first began looking into ways to address the infusion pump problem for hospital staff while pursuing her doctorate of nursing practice at purdue in 2008  through the indianapolis coalition for patient safety she submitted a grant to cardinal health with the vision of linking the smart pump databases of the indianapolis hospitals   it s exciting when an idea takes off rapala says to work with data on one platform with diverse organizations is a great step forward in understanding a device and the interaction with the care environment  the learning environment that purdue has created around the data platform will further that understanding and research community participants say they are convinced a continued focus on this national patient safety issue building on the research and data collection under way at purdue will give hospitals the necessary tools to improve use of infusion pumps spark ideas to improve the use of guardrails on the devices minimize alerts and grow their acceptance   the stakes are high wishard s young says this community established by purdue s regenstrief center and involving these many hospitals is helping us improve our patient safety measures and

aS' report corn ethanol waiver s effect on corn prices uncertain west lafayette ind corn prices pushed higher by the worst u s drought in half a century would not necessarily moderate if the federal government s corn ethanol mandate were temporarily suspended according to a report by purdue university agricultural economists the report potential impacts of a partial waiver of the ethanol blending rules suggests that corn prices could fall under some scenarios should the u s  environmental protection agency grant a partial waiver of the renewable fuel standard s corn ethanol provision but only under certain market conditions  the epa received a request by a consortium of livestock industry organizations to waive part of the mandate that effectively requires corn ethanol be blended with gasoline  the purdue report will be available wednesday aug 15 on the farm foundation website at http www farmfoundation org farm foundation nfp is an oak brook ill   based not for profit organization conducting public policy education for food agriculture and rural communities the authors will discuss their report during a live webcast thursday aug  16 a waiver could under certain conditions reduce the demand for corn and thus corn prices for livestock producers and other non ethanol corn buyers  under its normal schedule the epa has until october to gather information on the extent of any economic harm done by the original renewable fuel standard level and to decide if it will issue a waiver  for consumers the decision could affect what they pay for fuel and food the range of impact of an rfs waiver goes from zero to 1 30 per bushel for corn said wally tyner an energy policy specialist and the report s lead author  with corn crops shriveling in the field and yield projections dropping almost weekly corn prices have jumped 60 percent since june 15  a bushel of corn has topped 8 the prospect of a diminished crop and even higher corn prices has livestock producers worried that corn might not be available or will be too expensive to buy  corn is a feed mainstay for most livestock operations this year the rfs mandates oil companies blend 13 2 billion gallons of ethanol with the gasoline they produce  the mandate increases to 13 8 billion gallons in 2013 because oil companies blended 2 6 billion gallons of ethanol with gasoline above what was required in previous years they have built up blending credits known as renewable identification numbers or rins allowing them to count those gallons toward blending totals in this or future years  in the purdue study tyner along with fellow agricultural economists chris hurt and farzad taheripour looked at future corn and ethanol prices with and without an rfs waiver how rins and crude oil prices could factor in ethanol use and what might occur if the drought worsens   if corn prices remain high which seems likely and crude oil remains at 100 a barrel or lower then reducing the rfs could reduce the demand for ethanol and consequently the demand for corn tyner said   if the waiver resulted in less demand for ethanol that would in turn lead to lower corn prices than would have existed without the waiver  it also could lead to more ethanol plant closings at least temporarily conversely an epa waiver could have little effect if crude oil moves beyond 120 a barrel and oil companies continue blending ethanol at current levels tyner said  the severity of drought moving forward adds another layer of complexity to the issue the purdue economists said at the start of the crop season u s  corn production was projected at 14 7 billion bushels at a u s farm price of 5 34 per bushel the usda now estimates u s corn production will reach only 10 8 billion bushels this year at 8 20 a bushel  should the drought strengthen and the epa sticks to the mandated 13 8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2013 a corn crop of 10 5 billion bushels could push corn prices to 8 57 per bushel according to the purdue report  if drought conditions abate and corn production reaches 11 5 billion bushels corn prices could fall to 7 02 a bushel under a full rfs ethanol mandate   however because of carry forward blending credits from prior years the rins refiners and blenders could decide to produce and blend 2 billion fewer gallons of ethanol tyner said   that change alone could reduce the price of corn around 67 cents a bushel and that is without any epa waiver it will have to determine what impact issuance of a waiver actually would have given the way the market functions at present he said   for technical and economic reasons refiners may well continue to use nearly the same amount of ethanol even if they are not required to because of a waiver  technically they may not want to change their current mix of gasoline and ethanol to make 87 octane gasoline as an example economically they would not be expected to reduce ethanol use as long as ethanol prices are below gasoline as they are now  if refiners and blenders don t have or choose not to use operating flexibility and if reduced use of ethanol is not economical then a waiver would have no impact   to the extent that refiners and blenders do have flexibility with their use of ethanol a small waiver could reduce corn prices around 47 cents a bushel while a large waiver could reduce it as much as 1 30 a bushel depending on economic conditions   should a waiver lead to reduced ethanol use the epa could have an influence on who bears the brunt of the drought related corn losses tyner said   the total amount of harm from the drought is in the tens of billions of dollars he said the epa cannot change the loss it can only potentially redistribute it among the affected parties ethanol producers livestock producers corn

aS' research fungicides helpful when diseases are present west lafayette ind applying fungicides to soybeans free of foliar disease problems isn t likely to help alleviate drought stress and could contribute to fungicide resistant diseases says a purdue extension plant pathologist  soybean growers probably are feeling pressure to apply fungicides as the crop enters the r3 growth stage regardless of disease presence based on claims that the products can reduce drought stress increase photosynthesis and ultimately increase yields   we ve done research on fungicides in the absence of disease for several years now at purdue what we ve found is that when we don t have disease pressure there foliar diseases such as frogeye leaf spot or cercospora leaf blight we don t often see an economic benefit from a fungicide application kiersten wise said   we know that with soybean prices what they are that benefit would be something to really capitalize on this year but we just don t see a consistent response so it makes it very hard to recommend those fungicides in the absence of disease   many foliar diseases struggle to develop in hot dry weather so this year s excessive heat and drought have kept most at bay in fields that aren t irrigated and haven t had much rainfall  in addition to the lack of profitability wise said applying unnecessary fungicides also could lead to fungicide resistant diseases  one example is frogeye leaf spot a major disease of soybeans that already has resistant populations in five midwestern and southern states   one of the big drawbacks to using fungicides for these plant health benefits is that when we use the same mode of action over and over again we select for fungicide resistant strains of the fungus wise said   our standard recommendation is that fungicides should be applied only when foliar disease pressure is potentially yield limiting   more information and research results are available via purdue extension s aug 3 pest and crop newsletter in wise s article fungicide applications in soybean risk vs  reward at http extension entm purdue edu pestcrop 2012 issue19 index html fungicide'

aS' researcher s fish eye view could offer insights for human vision west lafayette ind a purdue university student s research project related to zebrafish eye development could lead to a better understanding of vision problems that affect billions of people worldwide  zeran li as an undergraduate student in biological sciences led a research team that uncovered an enzyme s role in the regulation of eye size in the fish  if the enzyme s role is similar in human eyes it could be relevant to human vision problems such as nearsightedness and farsightedness   new insights into the process of eye size control in zebrafish may help our understanding of the regulation of eye size in humans said li who has since graduated and is pursuing a doctorate in neuroscience at washington university   vision problems occur when the size or shape of the eye changes and what causes this is unclear perhaps this research will lead to a better understanding of this mechanism and the discovery of a new treatment for these problems   these vision problems called refractive errors occur because the physical length of the eye from the cornea to the retina is different from the optical length  if an eye is too long or too short light is focused in front of or behind the retina and vision is blurred she said refractive errors affect 3 8 billion people worldwide according to the international center for eye education  li worked in the laboratory of yuk fai leung a purdue assistant professor of biological sciences leung oversaw the research and guided the team but credits the two undergraduate students in his lab for the idea   the inspiration for this study came from the undergraduate students he said their observations and interpretations helped shape our current focus and allowed us to make this discovery  i m very proud of the scientists they are becoming the findings are detailed in a paper in plos one in addition to li and leung paper co authors include purdue undergraduate student devon ptak postdoctoral researchers liyun zhang and wenxuan zhong and continuing lecturer elwood walls  zebrafish are used as a model to study development and growth problems the zebrafish which are named for their naturally occurring black stripes must be made transparent to enable the careful observation and imaging necessary for the research  the most common way to achieve this transparency is to treat zebrafish embryos with a chemical called phenylthiourea that blocks the formation of black pigment he said  li had previously observed that zebrafish embryos treated with the chemical have smaller eyes than untreated fish and found that in addition to blocking pigmentation the chemical inhibits thyroid activity  the thyroid produces hormones that regulate metabolism and influence growth and it was thought that a general suppression of the thyroid hormone could be causing the reduction in eye size  li theorized that phenylthiourea might suppress thyroid hormone production because it shares the same structure as a known thyroid hormone inhibitor  she tested the effects of several different inhibitors and found that not all had the same effect on eye growth only those that halted production of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase resulted in smaller eye size   if thyroid peroxidase has a specific role in the regulation of eye growth it would be logical for it to express in the eye leung said   perhaps a localized manipulation of its activity in the eye could be used as a strategy to correct some vision problems of course first we must learn much more about how it regulates eye size   the findings also serve as a warning of the potential changes phenylthiourea may have on zebrafish a widely used animal model that could affect research results he said   our findings and others have shown that phenylthiourea can affect various aspects of physiology so the results obtained from fish treated with it may not truly reflect what is going on inside the embryo leung said   one should be cautious in interpreting their findings after phenylthiourea treatment this discovery highlights the need to find a new way to remove pigmentation   leung s group attempted to find an alternative inhibitor for pigmentation but all caused physiological problems and none were as efficient as phenylthiourea he said  the team plans to further investigate the relationship of thyroid peroxidase and thyroid hormone on eye growth and development  leung said the team also is analyzing the effects of traditional chinese medicines considered good for vision using fish models of human retinal degeneration   hopefully our efforts will expedite the discovery of novel treatments for human eye diseases he said li and ptak received national sigma xi awards for vision research  li also was a recipient of a sandy and zippy ostroy research experience for undergraduates award and a dr william h phillips undergraduate research internship  in addition to those awards this research was funded by grants from the national science foundation and u s department of energy  phenylthiourea ptu is commonly used for inhibiting melanization of zebrafish embryos in this study the standard treatment with 0 2 mm ptu was demonstrated to specifically reduce eye size in larval fish starting at three days post fertilization  this effect is likely the result of a reduction in retinal and lens size of ptu treated eyes and is not related to melanization inhibition  this is because the eye size of tyr a genetic mutant of tyrosinase whose activity is inhibited in ptu treatment was not reduced  as ptu contains a thiocarbamide group which is presented in many goitrogens suppressing thyroid hormone production is a possible mechanism by which ptu treatment may reduce eye size  despite the fact that thyroxine level was found to be reduced in ptu treated larvae thyroid hormone supplements did not rescue the eye size reduction  instead treating embryos with six goitrogens including inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase tpo and sodium iodide symporter nis suggested an alternative possibility  specifically three tpo inhibitors including those that do not possess thiocarbamide specifically reduced eye size whereas none of the nis inhibitors could elicit this effect  these observations indicate that tpo inhibition rather than a general suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis is likely the underlying cause of ptu induced eye size reduction  furthermore the tissue specific effect of ptu treatment might be mediated by an eye specific tpo expression compared with treatment with other tyrosinase inhibitors or bleaching to remove melanization ptu treatment remains the most effective approach  thus one should use caution when interpreting results that are obtained from ptu treated embryos '

aS' researchers sorghum should be in the mix as a biofuel crop west lafayette ind sweet and biomass sorghum would meet the need for next generation biofuels to be environmentally sustainable easily adopted by producers and take advantage of existing agricultural infrastructure a group of researchers led by purdue university scientists believes  the scientists from purdue the university of nebraska lincoln university of illinois and cornell university believe sorghum a grain crop similar to corn could benefit from the rail system grain elevators and corn ethanol processing facilities already in place  their perspective article is published early online in the journal biofuels bioproducts biorefining the midwest is uniquely poised to get the biorefining industry going on cellulose said nick carpita a purdue professor of botany and plant pathology   as we move to different fuels beyond ethanol the ethanol plants of today are equipped to take advantage of new bioenergy crops   the scientists argue that no single plant is a silver bullet answer to biofuels but sorghum should be a larger part of the conversation than it is today  cliff weil a purdue professor of agronomy said some types of sorghum would require fewer inputs and could be grown on marginal lands   in the near future we need a feedstock that is not corn weil said sweet and biomass sorghum meet all the criteria they use less nitrogen grow well and grow where other things don t grow   the ability to minimize inputs such as nitrogen could be a key to sorghum s benefits as a bioenergy crop carpita said corn which has been bred to produce a maximum amount of seed requires a lot of nitrogen  but sorghum could be genetically developed in a way that maximizes cellulose minimizes seeds and therefore minimizes inputs   if you re just producing biomass and not seed you don t need as much nitrogen carpita said farmers may also be more willing to grow sorghum a crop they re familiar with because it is an annual compared with perennials such as switchgrass or miscanthus that would take up a field for a decade or longer  sorghum would fit in a normal crop rotation with food crops rather than tying up valuable cropland if we re talking about planting switchgrass that s a 15 year commitment said nathan mosier a purdue associate professor of agricultural and biological engineering   you can t switch annually based on the economy or other factors you are committed to that crop conversion processes for turning biomass into fuel need to be scalable and take advantage of existing infrastructure for grain production said maureen mccann a purdue professor of biology and director of the energy center and the center for direct catalytic conversion of biomass to biofuels sorghum could be harvested and transported using existing rail lines to collection points such as grain elevators where the crop could be processed to a higher value more energy dense product before being transported for further processing in a refinery   biomass has roughly half the energy content of gasoline even if it s very compressed and tightly packed the issue is really how to increase the intrinsic energy density by preprocessing conversion steps that could be done on farm or at the silo so that you re transporting higher energy products to the refineries mccann said  farzad taheripour a purdue research assistant professor of agricultural economics said bringing sorghum back as a biofuel crop could have an economic impact on poorer rural areas of the country   given that sorghum can be produced on low quality marginal lands in dry areas producing sorghum for biofuel will significantly improve the economy of rural areas that rely on low productivity agriculture taheripour said   this could improve welfare in less developed rural areas and increase job opportunities in these areas purdue agriculture researchers are continuing to look at how bioenergy crops could be deployed into the agricultural landscape  work in the center for direct catalytic conversion of biomass to biofuels continues to develop a knowledge base for chemical and thermal conversion technologies that might be able to take advantage of the midwest s transportation infrastructure  ismail dweikat clifford weil stephen moose leon kochian nathan mosier klein ileleji patrick brown wendy peer angus murphy farzad taheripour maureen mccann nicholas carpita corn grain ethanol production is a mature industry built on a midwestern agricultural infrastructure second and third generation biofuels and bio based products industries could take advantage of this robust framework  significant but not insurmountable barriers remain for grower acceptance of bioenergy crop plants and capital investment in transitioning from grain to lignocellulosic biomass at scale  the existing infrastructure in the midwest provides a model for implementing an environmentally responsible and sustainable next generation biofuels industry into the agro economy   '

aS' restaurant smoking bans help snuff out european youth smoking west lafayette ind teenagers and young adults are less likely to smoke when faced with restaurant smoking bans and minimum tobacco purchase ages in europe according to new research by a purdue university sociologist   policies that restrict smoking directly affect young people s behavior and that may be a key element to curb smoking rates because most adult smokers report starting when they were teenagers says mike vuolo an assistant professor of sociology who studies youth behavior   in countries with restaurant smoking bans young people were 35 percent less likely to smoke regularly most studies look at individual factors such as income and education levels and smoking rates but this study also examined policies and other social influences such as antismoking messages in mass media and cigarette taxes  the article is published in a recent issue of social forces the results are based on self reported cigarette use of people ages 15 24 in the original 15 european union countries and the data is from eurostat the european commission s statistics branch and the world health organization  the survey information was collected in the spring of 2002 and there were 7 532 respondents with an average of 450 respondents per country   enforcing a law certainly plays a role in influencing behavior vuolo said while the bans and policies create a physical obstacle to smoking they also add a stigma that likely contributes to deterring young people from the habit   the study also found that local taxes and anti tobacco campaigns were less effective in reducing smoking than bans and age limits   strategies that rely on a personal cost or a cry to change behavior such as taxes or anti smoking posters weren t as likely to curb cigarette use as policies do he said   however a long term study that looks at the impact of each effort is needed to better understand how sociological factors contribute to individual behavior   because the 18 year old minimum purchase age in the united states is universal this finding is not as applicable as in europe when at the time of the 2002 data collection the restricted ages varied by regions  at that time six countries had no minimum purchase age three countries required consumers to be 18 and six countries required age 16  in countries with no minimum purchase age the probability of a young person smoking regularly was about 46 percent compared to 30 percent in countries with age restrictions   considering that most adult smokers start smoking when they are teenagers these laws and bans can be a first step to discouraging young people from smoking he said  note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the journal article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service at 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu abstract placing deviance in a legal and logical context a multilevel analysis of cigarette use in the european union though it has produced a high quality body of research the study of substance use has remained highly individualized in its focus  this paper adds further sociological understanding to that research using hierarchical methods the following explores how institutional and criminological theories can be incorporated into substance use research by examining cigarette smoking at three levels of variation  two main findings emerge first national legal context plays a role in understanding individual level probabilities of substance use even after controlling for individual and local characteristics  for example lower probabilities of smoking occur where there are smoking bans and minimum purchase ages second the effects of local context such as unemployment and the percentage of young people exhibit significant effects of individual level cigarette use   '

aS' sensor detects glucose in saliva and tears for diabetes testing these color enhanced scanning electron microscope images show nanosheets resembling tiny rose petals the nanosheets are key components of a new type of biosensor that can detect minute concentrations of glucose in saliva tears and urine  the technology might eventually help to eliminate or reduce the frequency of using pinpricks for diabetes testing purdue university photo jeff goecker  download photo west lafayette ind researchers have created a new type of biosensor that can detect minute concentrations of glucose in saliva tears and urine and might be manufactured at low cost because it does not require many processing steps to produce   it s an inherently non invasive way to estimate glucose content in the body said jonathan claussen a former purdue university doctoral student and now a research scientist at the u s  naval research laboratory because it can detect glucose in the saliva and tears it s a platform that might eventually help to eliminate or reduce the frequency of using pinpricks for diabetes testing  we are proving its functionality claussen and purdue doctoral student anurag kumar led the project working with timothy fisher  a purdue professor of mechanical engineering d marshall porterfield a professor of agricultural and biological engineering and other researchers at the university s birck nanotechnology center  findings are detailed in a research paper being published this week in the journal advanced functional materials most sensors typically measure glucose in blood claussen said   many in the literature aren t able to detect glucose in tears and the saliva what s unique is that we can sense in all four different human serums the saliva blood tears and urine  and that hasn t been shown before the paper featured on the journal s cover was written by claussen kumar fisher porterfield and purdue researchers david b  jaroch m haseeb khawaja and allison b hibbard the sensor has three main parts layers of nanosheets resembling tiny rose petals made of a material called graphene which is a single atom thick film of carbon platinum nanoparticles and the enzyme glucose oxidase  each petal contains a few layers of stacked graphene the edges of the petals have dangling incomplete chemical bonds defects where platinum nanoparticles can attach  electrodes are formed by combining the nanosheet petals and platinum nanoparticles then the glucose oxidase attaches to the platinum nanoparticles  the enzyme converts glucose to peroxide which generates a signal on the electrode typically when you want to make a nanostructured biosensor you have to use a lot of processing steps before you reach the final biosensor product kumar said   that involves lithography chemical processing etching and other steps the good thing about these petals is that they can be grown on just about any surface and we don t need to use any of these steps so it could be ideal for commercialization   in addition to diabetes testing the technology might be used for sensing a variety of chemical compounds to test for other medical conditions   because we used the enzyme glucose oxidase in this work it s geared for diabetes claussen said but we could just swap out that enzyme with for example glutemate oxidase to measure the neurotransmitter glutamate to test for parkinson s and alzheimer s or ethanol oxidase to monitor alcohol levels for a breathalyzer  it s very versatile fast and portable the technology is able to detect glucose in concentrations as low as 0 3 micromolar far more sensitive than other electrochemical biosensors based on graphene or graphite carbon nanotubes and metallic nanoparticles claussen said  these are the first findings to report such a low sensing limit and at the same time such a wide sensing range he said the sensor is able to distinguish between glucose and signals from other compounds that often cause interference in sensors uric acid ascorbic acid and acetaminophen which are commonly found in the blood  unlike glucose those compounds are said to be electroactive which means they generate an electrical signal without the presence of an enzyme  glucose by itself doesn t generate a signal but must first react with the enzyme glucose oxidase glucose oxidase is used in commercial diabetes test strips for conventional diabetes meters that measure glucose with a finger pinprick  the research has been funded by the u s office of naval research and the national science foundation note to journalists a

aS' signature of long sought particle that could revolutionize quantum computing seen by purdue physicist signature of long sought particle that could revolutionize quantum computing seen by purdue physicist west lafayette ind a purdue university physicist has observed evidence of long sought majorana fermions special particles that could unleash the potential of fault tolerant quantum computing  leonid rokhinson an associate professor of physics led a team that is the first to successfully demonstrate the fractional a c  josephson effect which is a signature of the particles the search for this particle is for condensed matter physicists what the higgs boson search was for high energy particle physicists rokhinson said   it is a very peculiar object because it is a fermion yet it is its own antiparticle with zero mass and zero charge the pursuit of majorana fermions is driven by their potential to encode quantum information in a way that solves a problem dogging quantum computing  the current carriers of quantum bits the basic unit of information in quantum computing are delicate and easily destroyed by small disturbances from the local environment  information stored through majorana fermions could be protected from such perturbances resulting in a much more resilient quantum bit and fault tolerant quantum computing he said   information could be stored not in the individual particles but in their relative configuration so that if one particle is pushed a little by a local force it doesn t matter rokhinson said   as long as that local noise is not so strong that it alters the overall configuration of a group of particles the information is retained  it offers an entirely new way of dealing with information majorana fermions also have the unique ability to retain a history of their interactions that can be used to encode quantum information he said   other particles are interchangeable and if two electrons trade places it is as if nothing had happened but when you swap two majorana fermions it leaves a mark by altering their quantum mechanical state rokhinson said   this change in state is like a passport book full of stamps and provides a record of exactly how the particle arrived at its current destination   rokhinson observed a variation of the josephson effect that is a unique signature of majorana fermions the effect describes the way an electrical current traveling between two superconductors oscillates at a frequency that depends on the applied voltage  the reverse also is true an oscillating current generates specific voltage proportional to the frequency in the presence of majorana fermions the frequency voltage relationship should change by a factor of two in what is called the fractional a c  josephson effect he said rokhinson used a one dimensional semiconductor coupled to a superconductor to create a hybrid nanowire in which majorana particles are predicted to form at the ends  when alternating current is applied through a set of two such wires a specific voltage is generated across the device which rokhinson measured  as a magnetic field was applied and varied from weak to strong the resulting steps in voltage became twice as tall a signature of the formation of majorana particles he said  victor yakovenko a professor of physics at the university of maryland was one of the first theorists to predict the fractional a c  josephson effect the effect is very unusual and is specific to majorana particles which makes this observation more definitive than signatures obtained through other approaches he said   majorana particles are the only particle that can produce this effect and experimental observation of it is a tremendous breakthrough yakovenko said   of course it will take time and independent confirmation to firmly establish it but this is very exciting the observation of this special state does not mean fault tolerant quantum computing will happen any time soon if at all yakovenko said   whether or not these particles will work for quantum computing has yet to be seen but in the process of trying we will learn a lot of unknown quantum physics he said   this could open the door to a whole new field of the topological effects of quantum mechanics a paper detailing the work will be published in the next issue of the journal nature physics and is currently available online co authors include xinyu liu and jacek furdyna of the university of notre dame who designed the material specifically for these experiments  furdyna also has an honorary degree from purdue the work was partially supported by grants from the army research office and the national science foundation  rokhinson next plans to perform follow up experiments and to modify the system to probe different properties of the observed state  the fractional ac josephson effect in a semiconductor superconductor nanowire as a signature of majorana particles topological superconductors that support majorana fermions have been predicted when one dimensional semiconducting wires are coupled to a superconductor  such excitations are expected to exhibit non abelian statistics and can be used to realize quantum gates that are topologically protected from local sources of decoherence  here we report the observation of the fractional a c josephson effect in a hybrid semiconductor superconductor insb nb nanowire junction a hallmark of topological matter  when the junction is irradiated with a radio frequency f0 in the absence of an external magnetic field quantized voltage steps shapiro steps with a height 8710 v hf 0 2e are observed as is expected for conventional superconductor junctions where the supercurrent is carried by charge 2e cooper pairs  at high magnetic fields the height of the first shapiro step is doubled to hf0 e suggesting that the supercurrent is carried by charge e quasiparticles  this is a unique signature of the majorana fermions predicted almost 80 years ago '

aS' specialists sell grain at harvest this fall store only if necessary west lafayette ind economic trends and concerns over the condition of grain because of the drought suggest there s little incentive for farmers to store grain this fall  but those who do will need to quickly dry it down to a proper moisture content and watch for contamination purdue university specialists say  as farmers prepare to harvest a poorer than expected corn and soybean crop they have to consider whether to hold onto their grain and hope for higher prices or sell it right out of the field  in most cases farmers should skip storage and take their grain directly to the elevator said corinne alexander agricultural economist   from an economics perspective in short crop years one of the things we tend to see is that prices peak early either before or during harvest and then decline through the remainder of the marketing year alexander said   the market is giving a strong signal to farmers to deliver early and at harvest because storage will not be profitable this is true for both corn and soybeans   markets reacted strongly to a pair of aug 10 u s department of agriculture reports one report estimated a 2012 national corn crop of just 10 8 billion bushels and a soybean crop of only 2 69 billion bushels down 13 percent and 12 percent respectively from 2011  another report projected lower world grain supplies for the 2012 marketing year that news along with a continued decline in crop condition as a summer long drought dragged on sent prices for corn and soybeans soaring  in recent weeks corn has eclipsed 8 a bushel while soybeans have shot past 16 a bushel farmers considering waiting out the market for even higher prices could be leaving money on the table if they put their grain in a bin alexander said  prices are likely to come down in the first quarter of 2013 as south american farmers harvest their corn and soybeans and provide some relief for stressed world stocks   those would include livestock producers who are supplying their own feed or producers who have contracts with either food or ethanol processors where the contract specifies a later delivery date she said  storing grain could present a host of challenges this fall including drydown methods mold leftover fine material in bins and insects said richard stroshine a grain quality specialist  grain could be going into bins at higher moisture levels and temperatures because many farmers planted early and could be harvesting later this month or in september when temperatures are hotter than in the typical harvest months of october and november stroshine said  unless farmers work fast to get grain dried down to appropriate levels their crop could spoil in the bin if grain is placed in a bin dry it needs to be cooled using aeration taking advantage of cooler nighttime temperatures stroshine said   mold will grow at 15 percent moisture if the corn is fairly warm say 80 degrees or so stroshine said it s very slow but there still can be mold growth there that could eventually compromise your ability to store the corn   for early harvested corn stroshine recommends a stored moisture content of 14 5 percent or 13 percent if the grain will be stored through next summer  to get corn down to those lower moisture levels rapidly farmers should use high temperature cross flow drying farmers who need to dry in the bin can increase the drying rate using a technique called layer drying stroshine said  like the name implies a farmer will place grain in the bin in layers while continuously drying that first layer will dry faster than normal and by the time you put your second layer in the bin you will have gotten some field drydown of that grain which should save some in bin drying time he said   another thing to remember is if you don t remove the fine material from the bin before you put grain into it you ll need to core your bin  fine material tends to concentrate in the center of the bin to core the bin open the center well pull out a load and you should get a lot of those fines out  if your grain is peaked you also should level the top surface which is very important for good aeration crop insurance crop losses incurred in the field are covered by insurance but post harvest crop losses are not   grain breakage dry kernels and kernels that have been invaded by fungi in the field will break up more easily so you ll need to set your combine at the lowest cylinder speed you can to get a decent removal of kernels from the cobs stroshine said   you ll also probably have a lot of foreign material with those kernels pieces of stalk and cob that could cause some problems  you might need some kind of cleaning equipment to help you out because i don t think the combine will be able to do it alone aspergillus ear rot  the hot and dry summer has provided a good environment for the development of this fungus in corn the fungus produces aflatoxin a carcinogen that can be harmful or fatal to livestock fed the infected corn  grain testing can identify infected kernels removing fine material and small kernels from the harvested grain can reduce the levels of mycotoxins but not eliminate them altogether   insects higher populations of grain damaging bugs are expected this year with the warmer temperatures and the availability of broken kernels and fine material as food  insect problems have been reported in grain already in storage additional grain storage tips are available on the purdue post harvest grain quality website at http www grainquality org general

teams have taken part in krannert school of management s experiential learning institute eli they have advised companies that are local from throughout the united states and from overseas that needed outside help with various projects   eli began in the fall of 2009 as a way to offer krannert mba students the opportunity to apply what they had learned in the classroom in an active business setting said matthew lynall a clinical associate professor of management and eli director   we are moving to make eli accessible to krannert undergraduates and to students from throughout the university he said as the program has developed we have undertaken projects in conjunction with other purdue colleges and schools including engineering agriculture pharmacy communication and aviation technology   we also do projects in europe where the students spend half the semester at gisma business school our partner school in germany and the other half in west lafayette   client companies get the benefit of bright and enthusiastic students solving critical business problems the companies also are helping develop a new generation of business leaders while identifying potential employees  participating companies pay expenses incurred by the school and the teams each team has four to five students they get four credit hours for the full semester course and spend 10 15 hours a week on the project   the companies typically have some affiliation with purdue perhaps through alumni connections or recruiting on campus lynall said   we have a growing number of repeat clients also graduates who have done an eli project often are keen to help develop projects at their new employers  and then some companies hear about the program and approach us out of the blue among past clients have been

plant orchard of golf west lafayette and kyk energy a company formed by two purdue undergraduates   beyond the credit hours eli students get valuable experience great references and can sometimes end up with a job offer from their client organization lynall said  ben crockett is a case in point in the fall of 2010 crockett a krannert mba student began working with four other students on a project for dow agrosciences at its world headquarters in indianapolis  the team which included a student from colombia and a student from china looked at how the company s forage sales representatives were approaching clients who are mostly dairy farmers   you apply what you ve learned and put into practice theories from your classes it s real business real problems he said crockett s team finished up last spring at the same time he completed his mba  he has been working for dow agrosciences since then in productivity and strategy acceleration utilizing six sigma methodology and recently was promoted into a global supply chain role  crockett is from idaho and earned his bachelor s degree at brigham young university in utah he chose purdue for his mba because of its strong reputation in strategy and supply chain management  he had not planned on staying in indiana until the eli project led to the dow agrosciences job offer now he and his family are happy to be settled in indianapolis  brian fife global strategy implementation leader for dow agrosciences is a purdue graduate who initiated the company s relationship with eli  he said the work has had three benefits for dow agrosciences the company benefits from good quality projects and opportunities to evaluate potential talent while strengthening its relationship with purdue   we have a positive and strong collaboration with dr lynall he said that has helped us for instance in expanding the project team into the college of agriculture  the whole partnership is a win win situation we get access to knowledge and the students get real world work experience get to know our business and have the opportunity to show us what they can do   after starting his job crockett was assigned to be the dow agrosciences liaison with the next krannert team working on a project  a member of that team anthony fisher has just been hired and fife said fisher will be the liaison for dow agrosciences next eli project which will be submitted in the fall  the success of the eli projects with dow agrosciences is just the outcome lynall wants for the program we want to help students turn their expertise into

aS' students prefer apps to the web when using smartphones west lafayette ind students prefer using apps on their smartphones instead of being pointed to mobile app sites according to a survey of purdue university students  this runs counter to a move toward mobile web development using html 5 by many web developers the study results are being published tuesday sept  25 at the online academic site educause center for applied research the study had 1 566 respondents and a margin of error of 3 3 percent  at issue is whether when looking for information such as wanting to check the weather forecast students go to a weather app or simply use their phone s browser to connect with a weather website  the survey results were clear students want the app for almost every type of use surveyed students prefer to use an app they have installed on their phones the lone exception was for reference information  using the weather example students had a preference for the app by 85 percent versus 8 percent who wanted to use the web the purdue students said native apps are faster and simpler to navigate perceptions that are also true says kyle bowen director of information technology at purdue s informatics group and one of the paper s co authors   they are easier and faster to use but native app programming is new and unfamiliar to most web developers bowen says and trying to cut corners in developing an app such as by using a template tool doesn t help you in the long run   this isn t welcome news for web developers who are part of a national trend toward favoring html 5 built mobile websites over apps  for example a 2011 article in the chronicle of higher education was headlined as mobile devices multiply some colleges turn away from building campus apps  but it s not just universities that are learning this lesson at the techcrunch disrupt conference in september mark zuckerberg said facebook s biggest mistake so far was betting on the html 5 mobile web instead of focusing on native apps purdue has developed seven mobile classroom apps designed to raise student performance through its purdue studio project bowen who leads the project says although he would prefer to develop mobile websites the project team learned early on that students weren t comfortable with them   the first version of our hotseat app had a mobile web interface there was no native app bowen says we discovered that students would go the app store and look for the hotseat app and when it wasn t there they wouldn t use the software on their phone   matthew pistilli a co author on the paper and an academic technologies research scientist at purdue says this information into use preferences is important because there is little doubt that mobile devices are the future for higher education   the advantage of using mobile devices in higher education is that it allows the student to take the classroom almost anywhere pistilli says   for example using an app such as purdue s jetpack or through mobile access to blackboard students can read articles work on assignments or collaborate with others from anywhere   pistilli says there are hidden benefits too because instructors and administrators can learn more about which educational approaches are working through data produced by the apps   analytics collected on application use allow an instructor or institution to do several things such as fine tune the software promote the use of other apps or simply provide information to students about how they can enhance their class performance pistilli says   when asked how to rank their skill level on using the phone from novice only using the phone for calls email and texting to expert having developed mobile apps 85 percent considered themselves either an intermediate 42 percent or advanced 43 percent user   students rely on their devices users describing themselves as novice used their device an average of 2 1 hours per day and expert users are on their device 5 3 hours per day   the most popular operating systems were android used by 43 percent of the students and apple s ios which was used by 40 percent   there are a number of manufacturers building many different android smartphones so apple s iphone is the clear favorite device among our students bowen says   the least popular device was the rim blackberry which was used by 9 percent of the respondents students are aware of data charges and 33 percent say they would never download a video unless connected to a wi fi network  in the debate over native versus neutral what do students prefer is a student s preference for a mobile learning application related to the nature of the information provided or the activity performed  this research bulletin examines a study conducted by purdue university regarding student mobile preferences this study provides insights into how students prefer to consume information on the mobile devices ranging broad categories to coursework specific areas of interest  additionally a brief case study of purdue s own mobile development activities illustrates one example for how this information can be practically applied  the information detailed in this research bulletin is intended to help inform future mobile application development efforts as well as establish expectations for companies with which institutions do business   '

universities were chosen by nasa to create an original experiment in capillary fluid dynamics through the space agency s national lab education projects for the international space station   this project will give students unique and in depth real world team based original design build test educational experiences that will accelerate their learning and their careers said steven collicott the purdue professor of aeronautics and astronautics whose students will complete the project while taking his course on zero gravity flight experiments  he is leading the project with john kizito a professor of mechanical engineering at n c a t the collaboration will expose our students the next generation of explorers to microgravity science and technology kizito said  the experiment is part of overall work to provide data that could help in the design of systems that require the precise control of fluids and gases such as life support equipment and fuel tanks for spacecraft  students will study the physics of how fluids change shape inside tubes in weightlessness findings also could apply to technologies for use on earth such as fuel cells medical instruments and miniature diagnostic devices  primarily undergraduate engineering students at both universities will design and build the shoebox size experiment develop the procedures for operation in space train the astronauts process the data and write research papers describing the results   we anticipate the experiment becoming operational in orbit in 2014 or 2015 said collicott who has designed previous experiments operated on the space station and also using suborbital rockets and drop towers   collaborating with dr kizito to lead our students in the development of an orbital experiment is an exciting step for me his nasa experiences and his teaching and research make this a good pairing   the project includes efforts to inspire middle school students to pursue and enjoy topics in science technology engineering and math or stem fields   we envision curriculum development that teaches basic stem concepts based on the topic of the experiment collicott said a great thing about the experiment topic is that we can design desktop demonstrations that middle school teachers and students everywhere can replicate and learn from in a hands on manner   the effort also will include contributions from portland state university other team members are professors mark weislogel of portland state and todd kelley from purdue and consultant emily cobabe ammann  about 20 purdue undergraduate students will be involved in the project each semester over approximately three years 10 n c a t  students per semester will be directly involved and about 20 fluid mechanics students per semester will do coursework related to

aS' study children abused by parents face increased cancer risk new purdue research shows that frequent child abuse by a parent can increase a child s cancer risk in adulthood and the effects are especially significant when mothers abuse their daughters and fathers abuse their sons  the research was conducted by kenneth ferraro distinguished professor of sociology and director of purdue s center on aging and the life course and sociology and gerontology graduate student patricia morton  their work was funded by the national institute on aging and is published online by the journal of aging and health purdue university photo mark simons  west lafayette ind frequent abuse by a parent can increase a child s cancer risk in adulthood and the effects are especially significant when mothers abuse their daughters and fathers abuse their sons according to new research from purdue university   people often say that children are resilient and they ll bounce back but we found that there are events that can have long term consequences on adult health said kenneth ferraro distinguished professor of sociology and director of purdue s center on aging and the life course in this case people who were frequently emotionally or physically abused by their parents were more likely to have cancer in adulthood and the link was greater when fathers abused sons and mothers abused daughters  overall the more frequent and intense the abuse the more it elevated the cancer risk we would like to see child abuse noted as an environmental factor that can increase cancer occurrence in adulthood  more research on this topic also could help mediate the effects or improve interventions to help abused children the research which was conducted with sociology and gerontology graduate student patricia morton was funded by the national institute on aging and is published online by the journal of aging and health we started examining a variety of childhood misfortunes including abuse and when these were all combined we found that men with the most stressors during childhood were more likely to develop cancer morton said   second we found that when children were abused by their same sex parent it increased their cancer risk the researchers can t say exactly why that is but a possible reason is the effect of the greater social bond between same sex children and parents   other studies have shown that if a mother smokes the daughter is more likely to smoke and the same relationship is found when sons mirror their father s behavior morton said   more research is needed but another possibility is that men may be more likely to physically abuse their sons and mothers are more likely to physically abuse their daughters   the study s findings were based on survey data from 2 101 adults in two waves of the national survey of midlife development in the united states  abuse was one of many childhood misfortunes including poverty loss of parent and family educational status that researchers examined to determine if there was a link to cancer in adulthood  in the first analysis the research team found that men who experienced the most cumulative stressors during childhood were more likely to have cancer  this was not true with women and this suggests that men and women may have different responses to childhood stressors morton said  the second analysis looked at each category of misfortune and this is where the connection between abuse and cancer was revealed  survey participants were not directly asked if they were abused but abuse was defined by survey answers to questions such as how frequently a parent sibling or other person insulted or swore at them as a child refused to talk them threatened to hit them pushed grabbed or shoved threw something at them kicked bit or hit them with a fist choked them or burned or scalded them  the frequency of these abuses also was identified the link was still there when controlled for the adults age lifestyle choices and economic status but the researchers would like to look closer at these mechanisms   it also is likely ferraro said that the effect between child abuse and cancer is underrepresented in our study because people who suffered abuse and were then incarcerated placed in a mental institution or died were not included in this survey of adults  these groups may represent people with more acute and severe effects from abuse and even though they are omitted we still find a link   the researchers are now examining potential links between child abuse and other health outcomes including heart attacks and types of cancer   the connection between negative childhood events and mental health is accepted and these findings reinforce that such events can also have a long lasting effect on a person s physical health morton said   it s shocking just how much the damage sticks and it is a reminder that childhood which is defined by rapidly changing biological systems is a sensitive period of development   in addition to morton and ferraro markus schafer an assistant professor of sociology at the university of toronto and former purdue graduate student also participated on the research team  the national survey of midlife development in the united states is sponsored by the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation network on successful midlife development  note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service at 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu objective to address the inconsistent findings on whether childhood misfortune increases adult cancer occurrence  methods this study uses longitudinal data from the national survey of midlife development in the united states midus that first sampled 3 032 respondents aged 25 to 74 during 1995 1996  a series of logistic regressions were estimated separately for men and women to test whether the effect of childhood misfortune on adult cancer was largely cumulative or specific to the type or profile of misfortune  results for men additive childhood misfortune physical abuse by father and frequent abuse by either parent increased cancer risk  for women physical abuse by mother and frequent abuse by either parent increased cancer risk discussion analyses reveal the importance of examining alternative specifications of childhood misfortune for men and women  additive childhood misfortune predicted cancer for men only whereas child abuse by parent of the same sex predicted cancer for men and women

neuroscience purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind the world continues to be a noisy place and purdue university researchers have found that all that background chatter causes the ears of those with hearing impairments to work differently   when immersed in the noise the neurons of the inner ear must work harder because they are spread too thin said kenneth s henry a postdoctoral researcher in purdue s department of speech language and hearing sciences   it s comparable to turning on a dozen television screens and asking someone to focus on one program the result can be fuzzy because these neurons get distracted by other information   the findings by henry and michael g heinz an associate professor of speech language and hearing sciences are published as a brief communication in nature neuroscience the work was funded by the national institutes of health and the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders   previous studies on how the inner ear processes sound have failed to find connections between hearing impairment and degraded temporal coding in auditory nerve fibers which transmit messages from the inner ear to the brain said heinz who studies auditory neuroscience   the difference is that such earlier studies were done in quiet environments but when the same tests are conducted in a noisy environment there is a physical difference in how auditory nerve fibers respond to sound   hearing loss suffered in varying degrees by 36 million american adults means there is damage to sensory cells in the cochlea and to cochlear neurons as well  the cochlea is the part of the inner ear that transforms sound into electrical messages to the brain in this study the researchers measured a variety of physiological markers in chinchillas some with normal hearing and others with a cochlear hearing loss as they listened to tones in quiet and noisy environments  chinchillas are used because they have a similar hearing range to humans and background noise is used in the study to simulate what people would hear in a crowded room   the study confirmed that there is essentially no change even for those with hearing loss in terms of how the cochlear neurons are processing the tones in quiet but once noise was added we did observe a diminished coding of the temporal structure henry said  the researchers focused on coding of the temporal fine structure of sound which involves synchrony of neural discharges to relatively fast fluctuations in sound pressure  both coding of fast fine structure information and coding of slower envelope fluctuations are critical to perception of speech in everyday listening environments   when noise was part of the study there was a reduction in how synchronized the neurons were with the temporal fine structure henry said  the auditory system filters sound into a number of channels that are tuned to different frequencies and those channels vary based on their frequency tuning  in a normal system the channels are sharp and focused but they get broader and more scattered with hearing impairment now that we know a major physiological effect from hearing loss is that the auditory nerve fibers are particularly distracted by background noise this has implications for research and clinical settings said heinz who also has a joint appointment in biomedical engineering   for example most audiology testing whether it is lab research or hearing loss screenings takes place in a quiet environment but testing noisy more realistic backgrounds is necessary to truly understand how the ear is processing sound  this also could influence the design of hearing aids and assistive technologies designers are often working on improving the temporal coding of the signal but this research suggests that a primary focus should be on improving noise reduction algorithms so the hearing aid provides a clean signal to the auditory nerve  other ways people can reduce background noise include induction loop hearing systems which are used in churches and other public settings to provide a cleaner signal by avoiding room noise   next the researchers plan to expand the study to focus on more real world noises and coding of slower envelope information in sound   additional study is certainly needed and there are others who are also looking at the role the central nervous system plays too henry said   but ultimately we found that hearing loss degrades temporal coding of sounds in background noise in the cochlea the most peripheral level of auditory processing

humans suggest that sensorineural hearing loss snhl decreases sensitivity to the temporal structure of sound but neurophysiological studies in mammals provide little evidence for diminished temporal coding  we found that snhl in chinchillas degraded peripheral temporal coding in background noise substantially more than in quiet these results resolve discrepancies between previous studies and help to explain why perceptual difficulties in hearing impaired listeners often emerge in noisy situations   '

aS' study moms can be stressed when certain children care for them research by megan gilligan from left a purdue doctoral student and jill suitor a professor of sociology found that older mothers are more likely to be stressed when they receive help from an adult child who is not their preferred caretaker   purdue university photo andrew hancock download photo west lafayette ind older mothers are more likely to be stressed when they receive help from an adult child who is not their preferred caretaker according to new research from purdue university   most mothers have a preference for which child they turn to in a crisis confide in and prefer as their future caregivers said jill suitor a professor of sociology   and when mothers received care from the adult child who was not their first choice they reported more depressive symptoms such as sadness loneliness and sleep disturbances  although mothers appreciated and acknowledged efforts from caregivers who were not their first choices these children were less likely to share the mothers values and to have the personal characteristics important to the mothers in selecting preferred caregivers  this incompatibility can have some strong negative effects on the flip side receiving care from a mother s preferred child did not affect the mom s psychological well being she said   we expected having that preferred child care for a parent would make a positive difference but surprisingly it didn t suitor said   and we also found that mothers depressive symptoms were higher when they received care from the non preferred child than when they received no care from their offspring   suitor also a faculty member in purdue s center on aging and the life course who studies parental favoritism with adult children collaborated on this research with megan gilligan a purdue doctoral student and karl pillemer professor and director of the cornell institute for translational research on aging at cornell university  the research was funded by the national institute on aging and is online in the gerontologist the findings were based on in person interviews with 234 older mothers as part of a larger study of 566 multigenerational families that began in 2001 when the mothers were 65 75 and had at least two adult children still living  all of the mothers were interviewed again seven years later the new research is based on the 234 women who reported they needed care within the previous two years because of serious injury or illness  during the initial interviews 75 percent of the mothers named a particular child they would prefer provide care if they became ill or disabled  this was compared to the children s actual roles seven years later after the mothers needed help the reasons why preferred children sometimes could not care for their moms were because they moved away or had medical problems themselves  researchers also controlled for family size and no differences were found based on number of children the researchers found that being cared for by a non preferred child is stressful because the alternate caregivers did not possess the social and emotional characteristics that the mothers expected   this matters because it makes people comfortable and this is especially important when people are under a lot of stress and in situations where they relinquish control to another person suitor said   and who do you want to give up control to to someone who has the same outlook on life and who you think is very much like you and therefore can respond to your needs and be a source of reassuring support   for example one of the moms in the study said that her preferred caregiver who lives far away was her preference because they can talk about anything  i think she understands me best and while the mom acknowledged the daughter caring for her was helpful and reliable she couldn t talk with her as openly  she would get annoyed with me although she s my rock here because she s the one that s here these findings are similar to previous work by suitor and pillemer that shows these factors are critical in relationships for spouses and adult siblings   as people become older and their health declines they start placing greater emphasis on relationships with family and friends with whom they have a personal history or an especially close and comfortable relationship and reducing contact with people with whom they are less comfortable gilligan said  when asked about the implications of these findings suitor said making assumptions about which children mothers want as their caregivers may be problematic  her previous studies on adult children and mothers show that the children accurately predict whether their mothers favor some children over others about 80 percent of the time but they are correct only about half the time in identifying which child the mom favors regarding closeness confiding in or for future care   we are not clinicians but i think there are lessons that can be learned from this research that can be put to use in conversations that families have about advanced care planning suitor said   perhaps these conversations can be expanded to include which children mom would prefer provide her with care geography often plays a role in preventing the preferred child from providing care but perhaps the adult children stepping into the role can call their brother or sister and say i m thinking about doing this for mom what do you think   ideally they can coordinate and avoid conflict the survey data is part of a 13 year project the within family difference study led by suitor and pillemer to evaluate the role favoritism plays in adult and family relationships  the data for the project was collected in the boston metropolitan area by the center for survey research at the university of massachusetts boston  in the project s next phase they plan to expand the study of causes and consequences of favoritism to three generations of the families they have been following  they also plan to extend the project by collecting data from several hundred multigenerational hispanic families in the chicago metropolitan area  note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service at 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu abstract the role of violated caregiver preferences in psychological well being when older mothers need assistance purpose of the study theory and research suggest that congruence between individuals preferences for future care and the patterns of care received will affect well being  in this paper we explore whether older mothers psychological well being was affected by whether the children they preferred as future caregivers provided assistance at a later point when the mothers experienced illness or injury  design and methods in this article we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collected from 234 older mothers and two points seven years apart beginning when the mothers were 65 75  results multivariate analyses demonstrated that mothers who received assistance from children whom they did not identify as preferred future caregivers reported higher depressive symptoms at t2 receiving care from children identified as preferred caregivers did not affect well being  qualitative data suggested these patterns occurred because the alternate caregivers did not possess the socioemotional attributes of preferred children  implications these findings contribute to a growing body of research demonstrating the consequences of violated preferences particularly when individuals are in need of support in later life   '

aS' superconductor flaws could be key to its abilities purdue physicist erica carlson stands in front of an illustration of the fractal clusters present in copper oxygen based superconducting material   purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind many researchers studying superconductivity strive to create a clean pure perfect sample but a team of physicists found that some flaws might hold the key to a material s unique abilities  erica carlson a purdue university associate professor of physics led a team that mapped seemingly random four atom wide dark lines of electrons seen on the surface of copper oxygen based superconducting crystals  the team uncovered a pattern in these flawed lines which are separate from the expected structure of the material and discovered that they exist throughout the crystal  the findings suggest the lines could play a role in the material s superconductivity at much higher temperatures than others this material is ceramic like your dinner plates and it has no business conducting electricity but under the right conditions it conducts electricity perfectly with zero energy loss carlson said   a better understanding of how and why this superconductor works could help us design better ones if we can create a superconductor that works at high enough temperatures it could transform how we use and generate energy   for instance room temperature superconductive wires could lead to power lines that do not leak electricity in transit saving tremendous amounts of energy and money  superconductors also have special magnetic properties that could allow for levitated frictionless trains and stronger more durable permanent magnets like those used in wind turbines she said  the electrons confined to these mysterious lines behave radically different than those that freely move throughout the crystal and it had been suggested that they could play a role in superconductivity  however whether the lines were merely surface effects or extended into the material was unknown because the scanning tunneling microscopy that reveals them can only be used on the material s surface she said  carlson collaborated with karin dahmen from the university of illinois and purdue graduate student benjamin phillabaum on a study to examine the tiny ladderlike lines that point vertically or horizontally across the surface of the crystal  by treating sets of neighboring parallel lines as part of a single cluster the team discovered that the patterns formed by the clusters are fractal in nature meaning they fall between two dimensions of space carlson said   when thinking of a fractal imagine a crumpled piece of paper she said it is more than the two dimensional flat piece of paper and it enters three dimensions but it does not quite fill that space  it is not a true and solid ball fractals can occupy fractions of a dimension they also have a pattern that is maintained even as you view smaller and smaller pieces of it   fractal patterns are mathematically understood and the patterns present on the surface of the copper oxygen based high temperature superconductors could be compared to known models of how that pattern can arise  using this information the team was able to determine that these patterns originate from deep inside the material a paper detailing the nsf and research corporation for science advancement funded research was published in nature communications the fractal patterns also offer information about the space they occupy and through this work the team developed a new analysis method to help understand the materials and the interactions going on inside of them carlson said   if you see pattern formation then you can try to identify the fundamental physics causing its formation she said it can apply to a lot of systems and materials beyond superconductors   carlson said the method could be used to identify the dominant class of disorder present in a material which helps in understanding its unique characteristics   we want to move beyond trying to get rid of disorder striving for unattainable purity in the materials we examine and instead take the disorder into account and use it to our advantage carlson said   these little patches of imperfection where things aren t lined up in a perfect crystal lattice are important and old methods that overlooked them fail to capture important physics  the flaws in the lines are like a fingerprint they reveal the identity deeper inside abstract surface probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy have detected complex electronic patterns at the nanoscale in many high temperature superconductors  in cuprates the pattern formation is associated with the pseudogap phase a precursor to the high temperature superconducting state  rotational symmetry breaking of the host crystal in the form of electronic nematicity has recently been proposed as a unifying theme of the pseudogap phase  however the fundamental physics governing the nanoscale pattern formation has not yet been identified here we introduce a new set of methods for analyzing strongly correlated electronic systems including the effects of both disorder and broken symmetry  we use universal cluster properties extracted from scanning tunneling microscopy studies of cuprate superconductors to identify the fundamental physics controlling the complex pattern formation  because of a delicate balance between disorder interactions and material anisotropy we find that the electron nematic is fractal in nature and that it extends throughout the bulk of the material   '

aS' survey indiana farmland values cash rents soar west lafayette ind indiana s farmland values and cash rents have continued to soar in 2012 even amid the worst drought in decades according to a june 2012 purdue university survey  the purdue farmland value survey showed a statewide increase in farmland value ranging from 14 3 percent to 18 1 percent depending on land quality since the 2011 survey  cash rents increased between 12 8 percent and 15 2 percent robust net farm incomes favorable interest rates strong farmland demand and a limited supply of farmland for sale kept indiana farmland values and cash rents moving higher said craig dobbins purdue extension agricultural economist  statewide the average value of bare indiana cropland ranged from 5 013 per acre for poor quality land to 7 704 per acre for top quality land  to assess farmland productivity survey respondents estimated long term corn yields for poor average and top quality land for the state the average long term corn yields for poor average and top were 126 159 and 192 bushels per acre respectively  the farmland value increases are good news for landowners but not necessarily for some prospective buyers dobbins said for the landowners the increase is generally a good thing he said   it makes the asset that much more valuable and if they are thinking about selling it they can sell it for a good price if you re someone who is trying to start out or get into farming this news isn t all that good  it just makes it more difficult to make a farmland purchase according to dobbins 2012 was the year many thought crop production margins and thus farmland values would level out or even fall  but the season long drought hiked grain prices and the prospects of higher 2013 and maybe 2014 grain prices led to higher farmland values  values of farmland moving out of agriculture called transitional land also are on the rise after a four year decline the 2012 average value was 8 505 up 7 2 percent from 2011   this is a specialized market with the transitional land value strongly influenced by the planned use and location dobbins said   the estimated value of farmland in this market has a very wide range for example transitional land value estimates in the june survey ranged from 2 500 per acre to 21 000  because of those variations dobbins said the median transitional land value of 8 000 per acre is likely more meaningful than the average  that number represents an increase in value of 750 per acre the survey also looked at the value of rural recreational land which includes land used for hunting and other recreational activities  the average value of an acre of recreational land was 3 489 an increase of 3 9 percent from 2011 the median value in june 2012 was 3 000 per acre the same as last year   as with transitional land there is a wide range of values for rural recreational land again making the median value a more meaningful indicator than arithmetic average dobbins said  this year s survey includes responses from 276 farm managers appraisers land brokers agricultural loan officers purdue extension educators farmers and professionals representing the farm credit system the farm service agency county offices and insurance companies  respondents represented six indiana regions and all but four indiana counties a full assessment of the survey results and more information about respondents and data gathering methods are available in the august 2012 edition of the purdue agricultural economics report at http www agecon purdue edu extension pubs paer pdf paer8_2012 pdf'

aS' test video photo abstract members of the jefferson high school football team seen here during practice were monitored in research to learn how impacts to the head affect brain function   purdue university file photo andrew hancock west lafayette ind a two year study of high schoolfootball players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits overtime and not from a single blow to the head as commonly believed  purdue university researchers have studied footballplayers for two seasons at jefferson high school in lafayette ind where 21players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season including 16 repeating players  helmet sensor impact data from each player were comparedwith brain imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before during and aftereach season   the most important implication of the new findingsis the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow but it s really the totality of blows that took place over the season said eric nauman an associate professor of mechanical engineering and anexpert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma the one hitthat brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel sback   researchers evaluated players using a type of brainimaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging or fmri alongwith a computer based neurocognitive screening test  the fmri scans revealwhich parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks thomas talavage an expert in functional neuroimaging andco director of the purdue mri facility said the scans indicate players areadapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes  brain scans show differences among high school football players in a two year study that suggests concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head as commonly believed   purdue university image thomas talavage the changes in brain activity we are observingsuggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced talavage said   the level of change in the fmri signal is significantly correlated to thenumber and distribution of hits that a player takes performance doesn tchange but brain activity changes showing that certain areas are no longerbeing recruited to perform a task   findings detailed in a paper to appear online in the journal of biomechanics are contrary toconventional thinking most clinicians would say that if you don t have anyconcussion symptoms you have no problems said larry leverenz an expertin athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology however we are finding that there is actually a lot of change even whenyou don t have symptoms   the paper was written by mechanical engineering graduatestudent evan breedlove nauman leverenz talavage former purdue professor ofeducational studies jeffrey gilger biomedical engineering graduate studentmeghan robinson health and kinesiology graduate student katherine e  morigaki electrical and computer engineering graduate student umit yoruk mechanicalengineering undergraduate student kyle o keefe and undergraduate student inelectrical and computer engineering jeffrey king  gilger is now a researcher atthe university of california merced the research may help to determine how many blows it takesto cause impairment which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting thenumber of hits a player receives per week   any change in fmri data is a concern but we don tyet know what these changes mean what they translate to in terms of cognitiveimpairment breedlove said  a common assumption in sports medicine is that certainpeople are innately more susceptible to head injury however the new findingssuggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the mostimportant factor talavage said   over the two seasons we had six concussed players but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not haveconcussions talavage said   there is good correlation with thenumber of hits players received but we need more subjects the researchers have expanded the study to include anadditional high school football team and girls soccer   we want to increase the number of football playersin the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don t wear headprotection nauman said   we also want to include girls to seewhether they are affected differently than boys the research findings represent a dilemma because theysuggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose   this might be especially important in young peoplebecause the brain is still developing so even though subtle unexpressed damagedoesn t manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life gilger said  changes were seen in regions of the brain that have beenassociated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte a progressivedegenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and otherforms of head injury   this is still circumstantial evidence but itsuggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as aresult of all these hits and the regions most affected are the ones thatexhibit cte nauman said  players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1 900hits to the head in a single season with two players exceeding 1 800 hits helmet sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 gs tomore than 100 gs  findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive andaccurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions moreaccurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from headimpacts determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a singleimpact or repeated impacts and develop new interventions to reduce the riskand effects of head impacts   now that we know there is definitely a buildup ofdamage before the concussion occurs ultimately there is hope that we can domore to prevent concussions nauman said  the work is ongoing and supported with grants from theindiana state department of health s spinal cord and brain injury researchfund general electric healthcare the indiana clinical and translationalsciences institute and through the national science foundation and nationaldefense science and engineering graduate fellowships  researchers also will follow the case studies of playerswho take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes inbrain structure using mri scans  the

were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan  in addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes  stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the biomechanical

molten rock in the plume condensed and solidified falling back to the surface as a thin layer  this sample was found in western australia and formed 2 63 billion years ago in the aftermath of a large

smalldroplets of molten and vaporized rock in the plume condensed and solidified falling back to earth as a thin layer the round or oblong particles werepreserved in layers of rock and now researchers have analyzed them to recordprecise information about asteroids impacting earth from 3 5 billion to 35million years ago   what we have done is provide the foundation forunderstanding how to interpret the layers in terms of the size and velocity ofthe asteroid that made them said jay melosh an expert in impactcratering and a distinguished professor of earth and atmospheric sciences physics and aerospace engineering at purdue university  findings which support a theory that the earth endured anespecially heavy period of asteroid bombardment early in its history aredetailed in a research paper appearing online in the journal nature on wednesday april 25  thepaper was written by purdue physics graduate student brandon johnson and melosh the findings based on geologic observations support a theoretical study in acompanion paper in nature byresearchers at the southwest research institute in boulder colo  the period of heavy asteroid bombardment from 4 2 to 3 5billion years ago is thought to have been influenced by changes in the earlysolar system that altered the trajectory of objects in an asteroid belt locatedbetween mars and jupiter sending them on a collision course with earth   that s the postulate and this is the first realsolid evidence that it actually happened melosh said some of theasteroids that we infer were about 40 kilometers in diameter much larger thanthe one that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago that was about12 15 kilometers  but when we looked at the number of impactors as a functionof size we got a curve that showed a lot more small objects than large ones apattern that matches exactly the distribution of sizes in the asteroid belt for the first time we have a direct connection between the crater sizedistribution on the ancient earth and the sizes of asteroids out inspace   because craters are difficult to study directly impacthistory must be inferred either by observations of asteroids that periodicallypass near the earth or by studying craters on the moon  now the new techniqueusing spherules offers a far more accurate alternative to chronicle asteroidimpacts on earth melosh said   we can look at these spherules see how thick thelayer is how big the spherules are and we can infer the size and velocity ofthe asteroid melosh said   we can go back to the earliest era inthe history of the earth and infer the population of asteroids impacting theplanet for asteroids larger than about 10 kilometers in diameter the spherules are deposited in a global layer   some of these impacts were several times larger thanthe chicxulub impact that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago johnson said   the impacts may have played a large role in the evolutionalhistory of life the large number of impacts may have helped simple life byintroducing organics and other important materials at a time when life on earthwas just taking hold   a 40 kilometer asteroid would have wiped out everything onthe earth s surface whereas the one that struck 65 million years ago killedonly land animals weighing more than around 20 kilograms   impactcraters are the most obvious indication of asteroid impacts but craters onearth are quickly obscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonicprocesses johnson said   however the spherule layers if preservedin the geologic record provide information about an impact even when thesource crater cannot be found   the purdue researchers studied the spherules usingcomputer models that harness mathematical equations developed originally tocalculate the condensation of vapor   there have been some new wrinkles in vaporcondensation modeling that motivated us to do this work and we were the firstto apply it to asteroid impacts melosh said  the researchers also are studying a different type ofartifact similar to spherules but found only near the original impact site whereas the globally distributed spherules come from the condensing vaporizedrock these melt droplets are from rock that s been melted and notcompletely vaporized   before this work it was not possible to distinguishbetween these two types of formations melosh said nobody hadestablished criteria for discriminating between them and we ve done thatnow   one of the authors of the southwest research institutepaper david minton is now an assistant professor of earth and atmosphericsciences at purdue  findings from the research may enable melosh s team toenhance an asteroid impact effects calculator he developed to estimate whatwould happen if asteroids of various sizes were to hit the earth  thecalculator impact earth allows anyone to calculate potentialcomet or asteroid damage based on the object s mass note to journalists  an electronic copy of the research

photo west lafayette ind an annual purdue university summer program that has benefited nearly 3 000 low income tippecanoe county children for more than a decade by providing lessons about sports and healthy living also is boosting campers self esteem and interest in physical activity according to new research  the purdue athletes life success program which serves children who qualify based on income guidelines began its 12th year on june 13 and will run through july 12  the program is housed in the department of health and kinesiology and does not advertise or recruit but more than 500 campers are registered and there is a waiting list   when we started in 2002 the focus was on sports and physical well being and while that drives the activities each year the heart of the programming is positive personal development said bill harper pals co director and professor of health and kinesiology   pals has just four weeks with these children but all aspects are dedicated to encouraging positive attitude self esteem and hope so they will be successful in life   since 2007 researchers have been studying the effectiveness and consequences of this approach and we re finding that yes four weeks in a program like ours makes a difference harper said   moving forward the next research phases will tell us how the camp experience helps children in the classroom and how we can better train our program team leaders   the campers ages 8 14 spend time at various stations strategically spaced on campus so campers walk more than an hour a day to learn about sports such as soccer judo softball basketball swimming volleyball and active team building games  other stations include art dance careers healthy eating and american sign language purdue federal credit union also offers a financial literacy component  the campers are placed in groups based on age and are with the same team leaders through the program these relationships between campers and their adult role models are associated with changes in self esteem and positive attitudes said meghan mcdonough associate professor of health and kinesiology who is leading the research  the first sets of findings were recently published in research quarterly and journal of adolescence and a consistent finding is that campers self esteem improves by the end of camp   the campers who reported the most supportive leaders at the end of camp were more likely to improve self esteem and motivation for physical activity mcdonough said   and self esteem is especially important for these at risk youth we also found that these higher self esteem levels were retained after camp ended   local youth ages 8 14 swim at the 2012 purdue athletes life success program this year s camp is june 13 to july 12 and more than 500 campers

of these team leaders are purdue ncaa athletes or are involved in club sports  eight of this year s team leaders are former campers themselves and 10 recent campers were selected to serve as junior team leaders  while the data analysis and publication of research data takes time mcdonough and her team regularly report their preliminary findings to harper so the camp can be updated   the research takes place behind the scenes but it is essential to camp function and helps us improve the camp each year harper said   a few years ago the researchers picked up on a theme of campers referencing local gang activity so we adapted the programming to have anti gang speakers and work more closely with local anti gang resources  these research findings also inspired us to adopt themes related to kindness fairness courage and caring pals is supported by many community and campus contributions including the division of recreational sports which provides the fields pool and other areas for activity stations and housing and food services where the campers eat breakfast and lunch every day  doctors and nurse practitioners from purdue university student health center and unity healthcare

aS' ag economist 2013 a transition year for grain farmers west lafayette ind changes in the economics of grain production after drought led to record high farm incomes in 2012 could mean a shift in the demand for and prices of agricultural inputs for the 2014 crop a purdue extension agricultural economist says  the 2012 drought ravaged crop left short supplies and high demand with farmers receiving high prices for the grain they were able to produce and high insurance indemnities on covered crops that were destroyed  high grain farm incomes capped a series of years with abnormally high grain prices but with some drought relief in major corn and soybean production states leading to expected higher yields and lower commodity prices grain farmers can expect to see changes in what they pay for inputs such as seed fertilizers fuels and chemicals for the 2014 crop  an apparent shift in market demand for corn and soybeans also could play a major role in what it will cost growers to produce the next crop alan miller said   the markets are currently saying they want more soybeans and less corn in 2014 which changes the demand for inputs he said for example growers don t need as much nitrogen fertilizer if they are growing less corn  that ultimately will affect the prices of inputs the big story in 2014 crop production costs miller said is fertilizer prices  potash and phosphate prices have been declining since the fall of 2012 and are down 15 17 percent since last spring nitrogen prices peaked last spring and have dropped about 22 percent this fall  farmers ability to apply fertilizer this fall will help determine what prices will look like for next spring if weather or a late harvest were to keep farmers from applying fertilizers this fall it could drive fertilizer prices down for the spring he said   normally fertilizer prices hit bottom in the early fall but we will have to wait and see is if the market is weak enough to sustain the drop into the spring   nitrogen prices also are falling because the u s is now a low cost producer north american fertilizer producers are expecting historically strong sales this fall  during the height of the ethanol boom farmers were growing more corn and using more nitrogen plus natural gas prices were high  since then natural gas prices have fallen which has led to renewed interest in investing in domestic production capacity for nitrogen fertilizers  this leads to greater supplies of u s produced nitrogen in the future if the cost of producing it here stays well below its market price as it is now   corn growers really will start to see the full effect of more domestically produced nitrogen in 2015 miller said we have been importing more than 50 percent of our nitrogen fertilizer meaning supply disruptions could easily impact prices  as we produce more of our own we will import less the bigger supply will benefit corn producers recent prices for nitrogen in anhydrous ammonia form have hovered around 700 per ton  according to miller that could possibly eventually fall to as low as 400 or 500 per ton if u s production capacity increases considerably  one area where farmers won t see price relief is seed costs by miller s estimates some seed could be up by 2 3 percent or more for the 2014 planting season   seed is not the place where growers will cut corners to try to save money he said they will be careful in pricing inputs but they want the technology to produce the best crop possible   the prices of chemicals such as herbicides pesticides and fungicides are likely to be a mixed bag for the most part chemical prices will be up slightly about 1 percent according to miller  the exception is herbicide where prices will remain flat prices for fuels commonly used on the farm currently are expected to be down in 2014  the costs for both diesel which powers most farm machinery and propane which farmers use to power grain dryers could be down by about 4 percent  fuel prices however can be among the most volatile costs farmers encounter each year because much of it is imported while an increase in domestic energy production has helped thwart major supply disruptions miller said tensions abroad could affect what farmers pay for fuel in the u s   we have to be a concerned because of the unrest in the middle east he said it could quickly change the fuel price outlook  farmers who have wanted to purchase new tractors combines implements or other machinery have encountered increasing prices machinery prices increased by an average of 7 4 percent per year from 2002 to 2012 because record high farm incomes increased demand  the sustained increases in machinery prices could quickly come to a halt especially for used farm equipment if commodity prices decline and stay down for an extended period of time miller said  as producers make their decisions about inputs for the 2014 crop year miller said the bottom line is that they should keep an eye on the economics of each decision  for fertilizer that means waiting to see if prices continue to decline while it also means going ahead and spending the money now for seed that best fits individual production systems   farmers always need to look for ways to be more efficient by looking for ways to drive down the cost per unit of output he said   they also need to be cautious with capital investments such as equipment and land purchases and rents '

camps for alaska native youth in the copper river valley in august  the goal is to teach them about the science and art of making copper tools like their ancestors made 1 000 years ago the ahtna culture is rich in stories and history about their ancestors and copper and our program will bring in the science components of archaeology geology and engineering of native copper said h kory cooper an assistant professor of anthropology who has been working in the copper river region since 1995 cooper focuses on archaeometallurgy which is the study of ancient and historic metals   after learning about the science of copper and archaeology the campers will have a chance to make tools using traditional ahtna copper working techniques and native copper nuggets he said   by incorporating archaeology and science lessons with their cultural history we hope to inspire these youth to study science or engineering   copper found in a very pure form considered 99 99 percent and is known as native copper was used by several different native groups in alaska and yukon as early as about 1 000 years ago  the ahtna a dene speaking alaska native group were best known for their copper working skills and for their control of the trade of copper to other native groups  children from the ahtna communities of klutina and ts edi na will participate in the cultural day camps which are sponsored by the ahtna heritage foundation and run by community members the program dates are aug 2 and 3 for the klutina community which is near the city of copper center and aug  10 for the ts edi na community which is about 50 miles from copper center this programming is supported by a grant cooper received in 2011 from the arctic social sciences division of the national science foundation  several ahtna communities offer culture camps on a regular basis usually in the summer where youth can learn more about their culture and traditional technology including such topics as gathering preparing and preserving different foods tanning hides and hunting and fishing  purdue graduate student elizabeth carroll who is working on her master s degree in anthropology and studies metal work will lead the cultural camp students through using stone tools and traditional ahtna techniques to make tools out of native copper nuggets   we want to let the youth feel and work with the material and experience how long it takes to create something cooper said the tools will be mirrored after items found at a local archaeological site near the ahtna community of gulkana that was excavated by cooper and others in the 1990s  these tools which include awls date back to a d 900 1200 an awl is an all purpose tool used to punch holes in leather for sewing and a variety of other tasks  cooper also will share with the students his research on native copper innovation in the region how this technology emerged in the past how it was used and how it spread  as part of the national science

are working on a range of options to overcome a fundamental obstacle in commercializing plasmonic metamaterials that could bring advanced optical technologies for more powerful computers new cancer treatments and other innovations  the materials could make it possible to harness clouds of electrons called surface plasmons to manipulate and control light plasmonic materials under development now rely on the use of metals such as gold and silver which absorb too much light for devices to be practical and are said to be lossy for this reason  they also are not compatible with the complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos manufacturing process used to construct integrated circuits   however there are many alternative materials other than conventional metallic components that exhibit metallic properties and provide advantages in device performance said gururaj v  naik who is involved in the research and received a doctoral degree in electrical and computer engineering last month from purdue university  alternative materials range from specially doped semiconductors to transparent electrically conductive oxides and ultrathin layers of carbon called graphene  an article about the materials was featured on the june cover of the journal advanced materials the article provided a summary of recent developments in the search for better plasmonic materials and an outlook of further research directions  it was authored by naik alexandra boltasseva a purdue university associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and vladimir m shalaev scientific director of nanophotonics at purdue s birck nanotechnology center a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering and a scientific adviser for the russian quantum center  plasmonic materials are promising for various potential advances including more powerful microscopes sensors new types of light harvesting systems for more efficient solar cells computers and consumer electronics that use light instead of electronic signals to process information cancer treatment data storage and even a cloak of invisibility  shalaev and boltasseva have formed a startup company nano meta technologies inc based at the purdue research park the company recently received 1 million in first round funding from the venture capital firm quantum wave fund to advance its early stage technology  nano meta technologies is focusing initially on two applications a new type of magnetic storage technology for computers and a new cancer treatment approach  the researchers have proposed replacing metals in plasmonic materials with a host of alternatives sidestepping the limitations of gold and silver   as far as i know we are the first to address this issue of lossy metals and come up with alternative materials shalaev said  the researchers are working to replace silver and gold in materials that are created using two options making semiconductors more metallic by adding metal impurities to them or adding non metallic elements to metals in effect making them less metallic  examples of these materials include zinc oxides and titanium nitride the purdue researchers propose using titanium nitride instead of metals for the data storage concept  because it has a higher melting point than gold or silver it is especially promising for the technology which works by using heat to record information on a magnetic disk  unlike gold and silver titanium nitride is cmos compatible nano meta technologies is developing prototype hard drive heads in the cancer treatment concept tiny titanium nitride nanoparticles might be injected into the bloodstream so that they accumulate in tumors clinicians might shine a certain wavelength of light on these nanoparticles from outside the body causing the particles to heat up and killing the cancer cells  information about nano meta technologies is available online at http www nanometatech com home php we are especially excited about using our materials to enable the next generation of ultra high capacity computer hard drives   said don stocks vice president of business operations at nano meta technologies the heat assisted magnetic recording hamr drives promise far greater capacity than is possible with current technology he said   the most difficult challenge faced by the industry is identifying a robust and reliable plasmonic heat source with the necessary optical properties stocks said   we believe we have a solution to this problem our cmos compatible plasmonic materials exhibit optical properties similar to gold with the added advantage of being very mechanically and thermally durable   lenses made of traditional materials can t focus light onto a spot smaller than half its wavelength the company is developing nanostructured compounds that can concentrate light through plasmonic effects to bypass this hurdle called the diffraction limit which restricts the resolution of light microscopes and lithography

demonstrates how the speak all app allows the user to select images to create a sentence  a version of speak all is available as a free download through the itunes store and a premium version will be available to purchase this summer   purdue research foundation photo download photo west lafayette ind stephen and diane beaudoin have tried for years to fully communicate with their son david 11 who is diagnosed with severe non verbal autism  the beaudoins credit speak all an ipad application with the enriched communication they now have with their son david has been using speak all  for about one year we ve found that david is building real sentences that we weren t getting no matter how many times we mimicked the behavior we wanted from him stephen beaudoin said   speak all helped him complete more meaningful interesting sentences which led to more meaningful interesting communication  he enjoys the interface and this has helped him pick up speak all very quickly david is one of many children who may be helped by the app  the centers for disease control and prevention report that as many as 1 in 50 children in the united states has some form of autism  developed at purdue university speak all helps children communicate by using photos and graphic symbols that represent what a child wishes to say and helps the child construct sentences  the app speaks the word or sentence which allows a child to communicate a thought and reinforces the word to help the child learn to talk  speak all resulted from research by oliver wendt a purdue assistant professor of speech language and hearing sciences and was developed by purdue s engineering projects in community service or epics program with support from the purdue innovation and commercialization center there are varying degrees of autism severity and the most severe degree is the non verbal where the child or young adult does not have natural speech to meet their daily communication needs wendt said   most children with severe autism learn to communicate by using a simple communication book where they pull pictures of what they want such as a picture of an apple and then they exchange the photo for what they want   following nearly 20 years of research on using low technology communication books and picture cards wendt and his team embraced using an ipad s interface for the same process but in a simpler less cumbersome way  a child affected by severe non verbal autism uses the speak all app to communicate with a student in purdue s speech language and hearing sciences department   purdue research foundation photo download photo the app allows the child to choose several images to form a sentence such as i want a big pretzel   the app can be customized for the child s interests and the recording within the program can use the parent s or primary caregiver s voice  ryan schneider and dorsey armstrong both associate professors in purdue s department of english have used the speak all app with their daughter mallory 7   mallory has been using speak all for a few months and before it was such a struggle for her to explain to us her needs and wants armstrong said   we ve seen a marked improvement in mallory she enjoys using the ipad and her frustration level has dropped dramatically for most people a child with autism comes into their lives and suddenly they are faced with all these different challenges jeff wallace said   speak all is a straightforward approach to teaching communication to children children using the app also have experienced a physiological change in their neurological connections   as part of our program we do research on the neurophysiological effects of interventions like speak all wendt said we ve found through neuroimaging that the brain activity moves to a more normal level during speak all  intervention a version of speak all is available as a free download through the itunes store and a premium version will be released summer of 2013 for a nominal fee  under development is a progressive version called speak more which is designed for children who have advanced beyond using simple sentence structures  wendt s research is

aS' cell detection system promising for medical research diagnostics this schematic depicts a new system that uses tiny magnetic beads to quickly detect rare types of cancer cells circulating in a patient s blood an advance that could help medical doctors diagnose cancer earlier than now possible and monitor how well a patient is responding to therapy   purdue school of mechanical engineering image bin da chan download photo west lafayette ind researchers are developing a system that uses tiny magnetic beads to quickly detect rare types of cancer cells circulating in a patient s blood an advance that could help medical doctors diagnose cancer earlier than now possible and monitor how well a patient is responding to therapy  while other researchers have used magnetic beads for similar applications the new high throughput system has the ability to quickly process and analyze large volumes of blood or other fluids said cagri savran pronounced chary savran an associate professor of mechanical engineering at purdue university he is working with oncologists at the indiana university school of medicine to further develop the technology which recently was highlighted in the journal lab on a chip the approach combines two techniques immunomagnetic separation and microfluidics in immunomagnetic separation magnetic beads about a micron in diameter are functionalized or coated with antibodies that recognize and attach to antigens on the surface of target cells  the researchers functionalized the beads to recognize breast cancer and lung cancer cells in laboratory cultures we were able to detect cancer cells with up to a 90 percent yield said savran working with purdue postdoctoral fellow chun li chang and medical researchers shadia jalal and daniela e  matei from the iu school of medicine s department of medicine we expect this system to be useful in a wide variety of settings including detection of rare cells for clinical applications   previous systems using immunomagnetic separation to isolate cells required that the cells then be transferred to another system to be identified counted and studied   what s new here is that we ve built a system that can perform all of these steps on one chip said savran also an associate professor of biomedical engineering   it both separates cells and also places them on a chip surface so you can count them and study them with a microscope another innovation is the fast processing he said  other microfluidic chips are unable to quickly process large volumes of fluid because they rely on extremely narrow channels which restrict fluid flow   the circulating cancer cells are difficult to detect because very few of them are contained in blood savran said that means you have to use as many magnetic beads as practically possible to quickly screen and process a relatively large sample or you won t find these cells   the new design passes the fluid through a chamber that allows for faster flow a standard 7 5 milliliter fluid sample can run through the system in a matter of minutes  the purdue portion of the research is based at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park the beads are directed by a magnetic field to a silicon mesh containing holes 8 microns in diameter  because the target cells are so sparse many of the beads fail to attract any and pass through the silicon mesh the beads that have attached to cells are too large to pass through the holes in the mesh  if needed the cells can quickly be flushed from the system for further analysis simply by turning off the magnetic field not only can the cells be readily retrieved for further usage the chip can be re used for subsequent experiments savran said  the work has been supported by the walther oncology physical sciences and engineering research embedding program in the purdue oncological sciences center the purdue center for cancer research the national science foundation and the indiana university melvin and bren simon cancer center  findings were detailed in a research paper published last year in proceedings of ieee sensors the work also was highlighted on sept  18 in lab on a chip purdue has filed a patent application on the concept note to journalists an electronic copy of the research paper is available from emil venere purdue news service at 765 494 4709  venere purdue edu aschool of mechanical engineering bbirck nanotechnology center and cweldon school of biomedical engineering purdue university we report a microchip system based on a combination of immunomagnetic separation and microfluidics for high throughput detection of whole cells  in this system target cells bound to magnetic beads flow parallel to a microchip with flow rates of mls min a magnetic field draws the bead bound cells toward the microchip which contains apertures that allow passage of unbound beads while trapping the target cells  the cells can be analyzed clearly under a microscope and released from the chip for further analysis by removing the magnetic field  the system was characterized by detecting breast cancer cells mcf 7 and lung cancer cells a549 in culture media using anti epcam conjugated magnetic beads  we were able to detect mcf 7 cells with 90 yield using a flow rate of about 4 ml min and a549 cells with 78 yield with 1 ml min  we also demonstrated high throughput detection of cells with concentrations as low as 0 8 cells ml in large sample volumes 12 ml  we expect this system to be useful in a wide variety of settings including detection of rare cells for

according to data from purdue university   students who worked out at purdue s gym at least once a week were more likely to earn a higher grade point average than students who visited less or not at all says tricia zelaya pronounced zah lie ah assistant director for student development and assessment at purdue s division of recreational sports going to the gym is so much more than going to the gym students who are motivated by fitness and wellness tend to have better time management skills and research shows that being fit is good for the mind  it all ties together for example the more than 1 820 students who visit purdue s france a c rdova recreational sports center at least 16 times a month earned a gpa of 3 10 or higher  the correlation between grades and gym use also is shown with

in using their student identification number  using these identification numbers school officials can then generate a report based on gpa because the facility was under renovation the last two years comparable data for recent semesters is not available but will be later this year once a full semester is recorded  so far the preliminary data is showing the same trend zelaya says kirsty crofton a

there is research that shows how physical activity has a positive impact on student academic achievement including children preschool through 12th grade   it s not a surprise to see this relationship for college students says blankenship who monitors a midwest study that looks at how an exercise based afterschool program contributes to elementary school students cognitive function   the cognitive benefits of physical activity is something i emphasize in our physical education teacher courses and it s a lifestyle habit that is never too young to learn   facilities such as purdue s are being renovated to increase space and to add services that support health and wellness at purdue registered dietitians are on staff to discuss nutrition and students have access to personal trainers and fitness consultants  representatives from the student wellness office are also onsite student success research shows that engaged students do better academically and we see that when they come here with their friends as well as classmates or study groups zelaya says   this is a place where students learn to use physical activity to cope with stress being fit also is about getting the appropriate amount of sleep and that is key to doing well in school  our goals for success go beyond the classroom and are aimed at helping young people develop healthy habits for life while many universities have studied user demographics such as frequency of on or off campus students who visit the gym zelaya says comparing grades with gym use is a new trend which is made easy by new student

aS' conservation easements preserve land for agriculture west lafayette ind landowners who to want preserve their agricultural land and prevent future development can consider granting a conservation easement  a conservation easement is the gifting of the development rights on a piece of land to a land trust which is a private nonprofit organization that works to conserve land  in doing so the landowner not only ensures the land can never be commercially developed even if sold but also receives federal income tax deductions   conservation easements on farmland are authorized by indiana law said gerry harrison purdue extension agricultural economist   the grantee or charitable entity has the responsibility under the law to see that the land is not developed for anything other than the landowner s retained purposes agricultural production and perhaps a homestead   in this type of voluntary agreement the landowner retains land ownership while the land trust makes sure that the terms of the conservation easement are followed  landowners can reserve certain rights in the deed of the agreement such as building a house or farm facilities something harrison said they should be careful to consider  landowners considering a conservation easement also should consider a current tax amendment that allows greater than normal tax deductions   the gift of a conservation easement provides a federal income tax charitable deduction harrison said the allowable charitable deduction was expanded by an amendment to the internal revenue code in 2006  that provision was temporary but has been extended through 2013 the temporary provision allows farmers or ranchers to deduct 100 percent of their contribution base adjusted gross income computed without any net operating loss carryback to the taxable year in a given year if at least 50 percent of their income is derived from farming  for example if a farmer had an adjusted gross income of 100 000 and gave a 90 000 conservation easement plus 10 000 in other charitable contributions he or she could deduct the entire 90 000 in the tax year of the donation as well as the additional 10 000  with a higher value conservation easement the taxpayer could carry over anything above 100 000 for a maximum of 15 years farming and ranching corporations that donate conservation easements also can qualify for the 100 percent limit  according to harrison ongoing government budget discussions mean the extension of the enhanced deduction for the gift of a conservation easement might or might not be available after 2013   interested landowners would be wise to consult with an accountant or tax lawyer on how these rules might reduce their federal income tax liability and how future gifts or inheritance of the land with a conservation easement might reduce values for lifetime gifts and the federal estate tax he said  even if the enhanced deduction provision is not extended beyond the end of the year harrison said gifting a conservation easement still has tax benefits  for example the landowner would be responsible for the cost of a professional appraisal to determine the fair market value minus the agricultural value of the parcel of land  the difference is the value of the conservation easement costs involved include the appraisal and the service fee paid to the entity that takes the easement harrison said   these costs should be easily offset by the income tax savings from the charitable tax deduction of the value of the easement  harrison said landowners interested in pursuing a conservation easement agreement should consult a lawyer because the deed over development rights is a legal document   tax treatment of conservation easements id 275 by bill hoover purdue university professor of natural resources and social science  both publications can be downloaded for free in purdue extension s the education store at http www the education store com by searching their id numbers  '

aS' corn crops expected to set record but not as large as anticipated west lafayette ind the u s corn crop is projected to reach record production this year but won t be quite as large as initially expected because heavy spring rain in parts of the country prevented some acres from being planted according to the u s  department of agriculture s friday nov 8 crop production report the report gave farmers and commodities traders their first glimpse at u s  crop production since september because the partial federal government shutdown canceled the october report the usda s national agricultural statistics service is projecting that corn production will reach 14 billion bushels up nearly 1 billion bushels from the record set in 2007  while a record purdue extension agricultural economist chris hurt said production won t be as high as some expected which is good news for farmers   there was a lot of fear coming into this report that the corn crop would be so large that prices would be extremely low he said   but while yields were up substantially prevented planting acres offset some of that usda lowered harvested corn acres by nearly 1 9 million and soybean acres by about 700 000 primarily because of land that did not get planted due to excessive spring rains  another positive result for farmers is that usda recognized the growing demand for the nation s corn and soybean crops from both export buyers such as china and domestic buyers such as livestock producers   a lot of people are breathing a sigh of relief that the crop is not larger and that there s a growing demand base for the crops produced hurt said   this report might provide a bottom for prices the usda currently is estimating the national average farm level corn price for the 2013 crop will be 4 50 per bushel compared with 6 89 per bushel for the 2012 crop  usda projected national soybean production to reach 3 26 billion bushels which would represent the third largest crop on record  the national average price received for 2013 soybeans is estimated to be 12 15 compared with 14 40 for the 2012 crop according to hurt soybeans could offer some income stabilization for crop farmers   we haven t seen the same erosion in soybean prices that we have in corn because of the strong demand from china and tight world supplies until the south american crop comes into the markets later this winter he said   soybeans could be a stabilizing influence in farm incomes it s never just about the size of the crop but what buyers you have and at what price they will pay for it   the overall large corn and soybean crops will be welcome news to end users such as processors and livestock producers and ultimately food and fuel consumers  with grain more readily available and at lower prices food price inflation should fall below the general rate of inflation for the last two years food price inflation has been higher than general inflation  indiana farmers are following the national trend with projected record corn production at more than 1 billion bushels for the first time  at 174 bushels per acre the state s farmers also are expected to break the record for yield the record of 171 bushels per acre was set in 2009  this compares with a national per acre corn yield average of 160 4 bushels which hurt said would be a fairly normal yield the state s soybean farmers are expected to produce an estimated 2 6 million bushels on yields of 50 bushels per acre  that would tie per acre yields from 2006 and fall just short of the record 51 5 bushels per acre in 2004 these yields compare with 43 bushels per acre nationally which hurt said also is close to normal expectations  '

aS' device speeds concentration step in food pathogen detection purdue university doctoral students from left xuan li and seockmo ku operate a new system that concentrates foodborne salmonella and other pathogens faster than conventional methods representing a potential new tool for speedier detection  the research is led by michael ladisch center a distinguished professor of agricultural and biological engineering purdue university photo steven yang  download photo west lafayette ind researchers have developed a system that concentrates foodborne salmonella and other pathogens faster than conventional methods by using hollow thread like fibers that filter out the cells representing a potential new tool for speedier detection  the machine called a continuous cell concentration device could make it possible to routinely analyze food or water samples to screen for pathogens within a single work shift at food processing plants   this approach begins to address the critical need for the food industry for detecting food pathogens within six hours or less said michael ladisch a distinguished professor of agricultural and biological engineering at purdue university ideally you want to detect foodborne pathogens in one work shift from start to finish which means extracting the sample concentrating the cells and detection   a report from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc indicates a lack of recent progress in reducing foodborne infections and highlights the need for improved prevention  although many foodborne illnesses have declined in the past 15 years the number of laboratory confirmed salmonella cases did not change significantly in 2012 compared with 2006 to 2008  the first step in detecting foodborne pathogens is concentrating the number of cells in test samples the new system enables researchers to carry out the concentration step within one hour compared to a day for the standard method now in commercial use said ladisch also a professor of biomedical engineering and director of purdue s laboratory of renewable resources engineering lorre  findings are detailed in a research paper to appear in november in the journal applied and environmental microbiology the paper was authored by doctoral student xuan li lorre research scientist eduardo ximenes postdoctoral research associate mary anne roshni amalaradjou undergraduate student hunter b  vibbert senior research engineer kirk foster engineering resources manager jim jones microbiologist xingya liu arun k bhunia a professor of food microbiology and ladisch  findings showed the system was able to concentrate inoculated salmonella by 500 to 1 000 times the original concentration in test samples  this level of concentration is required for accurate detection another finding showed the system recovered 70 percent of the living pathogen cells in samples ladisch said   this is important because if you filter microorganisms and kill them in the process that s self defeating he said the goal is to find out how many living microorganisms are present   the machine was used to concentrate cells in a sample of chicken meat the sample is first broken down into the consistency of a milkshake and chemically pretreated to prevent the filtering membranes from clogging  the fluid is then passed through 12 hollow fiber filters about 300 microns in diameter that are contained in a tube about the size of a cocktail straw  the filtering process continues until pathogens if present are concentrated enough to be detected the technique developed by researchers from purdue s colleges of engineering and agriculture could be performed during food processing or vegetable washing before the products are shipped  the u s department of agriculture will test the system which is not yet ready for commercialization one feature that could make the machine practical for commercial application is that it can be quickly cleaned between uses  the tubes are flushed with sodium hydroxide and alcohol the research is funded by the u s department of agriculture purdue s agricultural research programs and center for food safety engineering and the department of

aS' discovery of gene function may help prevent kidney stones west lafayette ind the discovery of a gene s function in e coli and other bacteria might lead to a probiotic to prevent the most common type of kidney stone according to a purdue university study  human cells can t metabolize oxalate an acidic chemical found in nearly all plants we eat so any oxalate we absorb from food must be excreted from the body  calcium oxalate urinary stones can form when oxalate reaches a high concentration in the kidneys about 80 percent of kidney stones are composed of insoluble calcium oxalate  t joseph kappock assistant professor of biochemistry and his research team made the discovery during a study of genes in acetobacter aceti a harmless bacterium that is typically used to convert wine to vinegar  acetobacter aceti which normally lives on plant tissue thrives in acidic conditions that easily kill most other bacteria kappock said  the researchers were searching for other acids in addition to acetic acid the acid present in vinegar that the bacterium can metabolize   we were very excited when we realized e coli has the same genetic setup as acetobacter aceti said kappock whose findings were published in the journal plos one kappock and doctoral students elwood a mullins and kelly l sullivan found that acetobacter aceti and e coli each contain an enzyme with a previously unknown function called yfde in e  coli dna sequencing had identified related genes in each bacterium but provided little insight about its function when we look at a bacterial genome by dna sequencing we can t tell what many of the proteins in the organism do kappock said   i compare it to knowing that a vehicle has an internal combustion engine you don t know if it s in an indy car or a diesel truck  dna sequencing tells us we have an internal combustion engine in this organism but we don t know what it s for or what it can do   a few bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract eat oxalate and we think we know how those work kappock said but we don t know why so many others are killed by oxalate even though they have genes that would seem to be able to protect them  oxalate is a very hard nut to crack it s a very stable molecule that is difficult to decompose the enzymes that process it are pretty specialized and don t seem to connect to normal bacterial metabolic pathways in an obvious way   the researchers determined which chemicals are processed by the yfde enzyme following a hunch that it would use oxalate their results connected oxalate degradation to the core of bacterial metabolism  assigning a function to yfde may help identify beneficial bacteria that could serve as probiotic agents in the human gastrointestinal tract to reduce the risk of kidney stone formation  kidney stones which affect more than 5 percent of the u s population can cause painful blockages of the urinary tract if we understand what bacteria need to degrade oxalate then we might have a better idea how to identify strains that can do that and thereby suppress the uptake of dietary oxalate he said   there are probably bacteria out there that have engineered themselves to do this for us because we ve figured out what the gene product does we will be able to find it in any organism and can zero in on those that might be beneficial he said  the researchers used x ray crystallography to pinpoint the most important regions of the yfde enzyme kappock said the information has other applications as well  scientists and engineers who are interested in mapping and reprogramming microbial metabolism now know what one more gene product does  agricultural research at purdue the national science foundation and the u s department of energy funded the research acetyl coa oxalate coa transferase 1 function and x ray crystal structure of escherichia coli yfde many food plants accumulate oxalate which humans absorb but do not metabolize leading to the formation of urinary stones the commensal bacterium oxalobacter formigenes consumes oxalate by converting it to oxalyl coa which is decarboxylated by oxalyl coa decarboxylase oxc  oxc and the class iii coa transferase formyl coa oxalate coa transferase fcoct are widespread among bacteria including many that have no apparent ability to degrade or to resist external oxalate  the evga acid response regulator activates transcription of the escherichia coli yfdxwuve operon encoding yfdw fcoct yfdu oxc and yfde a class iii coa transferase that is 126 30 identical to yfdw  yfdw and yfdu are necessary and sufficient for oxalate induced protection against a subsequent acid challenge neither of the other genes has a known function  we report the purification in vitro characterization 2 1 a crystal structure and functional assignment of yfde yfde and uctc an orthologue from the obligate aerobe acetobacter aceti perform the reversible conversion of acetyl coa and oxalate to oxalyl coa and acetate  the annotation of yfde as acetyl coa oxalate coa transferase acoct expands the scope of metabolic pathways linked to oxalate catabolism and the oxalate induced acid tolerance response  fcoct

download photo west lafayette ind researchers have discovered that rising temperature induces key changes in the dengue virus when it enters its human host and the findings represent a new approach for designing vaccines against the aggressive mosquito borne pathogen  the researchers found that the dengue virus particles swell slightly and take on a bumpy appearance when heated to human body temperature exposing epitopes or regions where antibodies could attach to neutralize the virus  the discovery is significant because it could help to explain why vaccines against dengue have been ineffective said michael g  rossmann hanley distinguished professor of biological sciences at purdue university scientists have been designing vaccines targeting the virus s smooth appearance found at the cooler temperatures of mosquitoes and ticks   the bumpy form of the virus would be the form present in humans so the optimal dengue virus vaccines should induce antibodies that preferentially recognize epitopes exposed in that form rossmann said  the findings are detailed in a research paper appearing online this week in proceedings of the national academy of sciences the researchers used a technique called cryo electron microscopy to see the three dimensional structure of the virus at temperatures ranging from 28 37 degrees celsius 37 degrees celsius is 98 6 degrees fahrenheit or human body temperature  findings showed that the virus has a smooth appearance while at the cooler temperatures found in mosquito or tick vectors but then it morphs into the bumpy form at warmer temperatures before fusing to the host cell and delivering its genetic material   these findings were a big surprise said richard j kuhn professor and head of purdue s department of biological sciences and director of the bindley bioscience center   no one expected to see the virus change its appearance as it moves from the mosquito to humans the paper was co authored by postdoctoral researcher xinzheng zhang lab manager ju sheng postdoctoral researcher pavel plevka kuhn michael s  diamond a researcher at washington university school of medicine and rossmann findings also could apply to related infections in the flavivirus family which includes a number of dangerous insect borne diseases such as west nile yellow fever tick borne encephalitis and japanese encephalitis  dengue pronounced den g 275 is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some asian and latin american countries causing 50 million to 100 million infections per year  globally dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades placing about half the world s population at risk of infection the researchers determined that the bumpy form of the virus is more efficient at infecting mammalian cells  the team was able to measure the virus s infectivity using a laboratory procedure where cells are infected in a culture dish the bumpy shape is an intermediate stage before the virus becomes unstable releasing its genetic material  the virus is made of subunit molecules that separate when the virus particle expands into its bumpy form revealing exposed membrane surfaces between the subunits where antibodies might bind  the work is funded by the national institutes of health and purdue through university support for a structural biology electron microscope facility  note to

aS' drug may reduce chronic pain for spinal cord injuries purdue researcher riyi shi is leading work to study the role of a known neurotoxin in chronic pain for people who suffer from paralysis  a drug that has been shown to remove the toxin might be used to treat the pain purdue university photo michel schweinsberg download photo west lafayette ind researchers have discovered that a known neurotoxin may cause chronic pain in people who suffer from paralysis and a drug that has been shown to remove the toxin might be used to treat the pain  the toxin called acrolein is produced in the body after nerve cells are injured triggering a cascade of biochemical events thought to worsen the injury s severity  the drug hydralazine which has been approved by the u s food and drug administration for hypertension has been shown to be effective in reducing acrolein levels in the body  new research shows hydralazine is effective in reducing chronic pain in laboratory animals and potentially in people who have suffered neurotrauma resulting in paralysis said riyi shi pronounced ree shee a professor of neuroscience and biomedical engineering in purdue s department of basic medical sciences college of veterinary medicine and weldon school of biomedical engineering   beyond paralysis chronic neuropathic pain drastically impairs the quality of life for spinal cord injury victims he said   pain can persist for decades post injury which could contribute to depression and suicide the research is a collaboration between purdue and the indiana university school of medicine  new findings are detailed in a research paper appearing this month in the journal of neurochemistry the paper was authored by michael due a postdoctoral fellow at the iu school of medicine purdue graduate students jonghyuck park lingxing zheng and michael walls iu graduate student yohance m  allette fletcher a white the v k stoelting chair of anesthesia professor of pharmacology and toxicology at iu school of medicine and shi  researchers studied the role acrolein plays in hypersensitivity to pain in laboratory rats and the effectiveness of hydralazine in reducing the pain   it turns out that acrolein is a very important compound behind neuropathic pain shi said in a chronic pain situation a stimulus that ordinarily might feel pleasant even just a little touch could cause pain   findings show the quantity of acrolein increases after a spinal cord injury and may activate pain receptors protein channels called trpa1 contained in pain sensory nerve fibers of dorsal root ganglia located alongside the spine  following spinal cord injury the dorsal root ganglia could be affected biochemically or directly through physical trauma the amplification of pain can be exacerbated in spinal cord injury due to acrolein s direct activation of pain receptors as well as acrolein induced inflammation that further intensifies pain sensation shi said   sometimes you have pain even without stimulation you can have excruciating pain just sitting there findings also indicate that injury causes a three fold increase in the number of trpa1 channels which could further amplify pain caused by acrolein  the research showed hydralazine significantly reduces pain in experiments that measure a rat s reaction to stimulation even if we delay administration of hydralazine we can still reduce the pain meaning not only acute but chronic pain might be reduced by acrolein scavenging treatment shi said   this could be promising news for millions of spinal cord injury victims who may suffer from debilitating pain the research is funded by the national institutes of health indiana department of health and the indiana ctsi collaboration in biomedical translational research  note to

sensitization and hyperreflexia following sci via the trpa1 dependent mechanism  here we report that there are enhanced levels of acrolein and increased neuronal sensitivity to the aldehyde for at least 14 days after sci  concurrent with injury induced increases in acrolein concentration is an increased expression of trpa1 in the lumbar l3 l6 sensory ganglia  as proof of the potential pronociceptive role for acrolein intrathecal injections of acrolein revealed enhanced sensitivity to both tactile and thermal stimuli for up to 10 days supporting the compound s pro nociceptive functionality  treatment of sci animals with the acrolein scavenger hydralazine produced moderate improvement in tactile responses as well as robust changes in thermal sensitivity for up to 49 days  taken together these data suggests that acrolein directly modulates sci associated pain behavior making it a novel vietherapeutic target for preclinical and clinical sci as an analgesic  '

aS' engineering pre eminent teams get priority in hiring west lafayette ind purdue university s college of engineering has named four research teams that will be a priority for faculty hiring during the coming year  the teams were chosen because the work they do has the potential for dramatic impact and international pre eminence they are part of the college s strategic growth plan that will add as many as 107 faculty over five years  in addition to the team hiring other hires are related to strengthening disciplines and taking advantage of opportunities to enhance quality or diversity  the strategic growth plan is part of purdue moves a range of initiatives designed to broaden purdue s global impact and enhance educational opportunities for its students   the pre eminent teams are a research centric approach to faculty hiring said leah jamieson the john a edwardson dean of engineering   we asked the candidates to tell us how they would form a team to catapult their research to the level of international prominence  that was the starting point for choosing the first year teams the teams already are part of the college to become pre eminent teams they went through a process similar to a pitch entrepreneurs would give to venture capitalists  in the first round 32 team leaders competed before a panel of distinguished engineering faculty in the second round 12 team leaders made their pitches to a panel with half of its members coming from outside the university  from the university panelists were from both inside and outside of the college of engineering the successful teams showed agility creativity a willingness to take risks and an ability to move outside their comfort zones jamieson said   implantable networks of wireless nanoelectronic devices to enable medical

suppression of epileptic seizures prosthesis control for injured military personnel modulation of cardiac arrhythmias treatment of depression and gastroparesis a partial paralysis of the stomach and monitoring of intraocular pressure and therapeutic intervention for glaucoma  the research calls for a partnership among the center for implantable devices with the national science foundation needs nano engineered electronic device simulation initiative led by mark lundstrom the don and carol scifres distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering the goodman campbell brain and spine neurosurgical practice and the indiana university school of medicine   the key enabling technologies come from nanotechnology irazoqui said access to them comes from our partnership with needs

systems far more powerful than today s computers the research team is led by vladimir m  shalaev scientific director of nanophotonics at purdue s birck nanotechnology center and the robert and anne burnett distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering  the technology hinges on using single photons the tiny particles that make up light for switching and routing in future computers that might harness the exotic principles of quantum mechanics  the quantum information processing technology would use structures called metamaterials artificial nanostructured media the metamaterials when combined with tiny optical emitters could make possible a new hybrid technology that uses quantum light in future computers  computers based on quantum physics would have quantum bits or qubits that exist in both the on and off states simultaneously dramatically increasing the computer s power and memory  quantum computers would take advantage of a strange phenomenon described by quantum theory called entanglement instead of only the states of one and zero there are many possible entangled quantum states in between   other important quantum information applications include for example a quantum internet secure information quantum simulators atomic clocks ultrapowerful sensors quantum cryptography and teleportation shalaev said   new methods to study energetic materials including explosives propellants and pyrotechnics for applications largely focused on national defense and security  the research team is led by stephen beaudoin a professor of chemical engineering researchers are working to characterize detect and defeat existing and emerging energetic materials and to develop new and improved materials for military applications  the primary driver is in homeland security environments work that aims to transform the way that explosives screening is performed allowing the implementation of arrays of complementary sensors designed to detect and track explosives when they are at large distances from intended targets  some technologies being developed will analyze the spectrum of light shining through vaporized samples others will analyze solid residues  the research includes work focusing on detecting traces of explosives characterizing homemade explosives so that their threat can be better assessed and using ct and other scanners to detect and identify bulk explosives in containers such as luggage and cargo cases   the work we do aims to improve screening for explosives at airports sea ports and other public venues like football arenas and the civilian infrastructure beaudoin said   techniques to more efficiently use the increasingly congested radio spectrum for communications in commercial military and emergency services applications  the growing number of mobile devices in operation threatens a coming spectrum crisis advances are needed to ensure reliable communications to reduce dropped calls and slow downloads and to ease congestion over the airwaves  the research team is led by david love a professor of electrical and computer engineering and university faculty scholar the effort dovetails with a recent national focus on the problem  congress approved a national broadband plan in march 2010 the white house announced a 100 million investment in spectrum initiatives earlier this year and efforts also involve multiple government agencies including the national science foundation and defense advanced research projects agency  the research aims to help reduce interference in radio communications and allow high priority radios for the military and disaster relief to operate with minimal disruption and loss of life love said  researchers are developing advanced models and mathematical theory to better analyze and understand radio transmissions these teams have the potential to dramatically build on their current strengths with strategic hires jamieson said   their research will have far

aS' excited about a cloudy future at purdue university and emc bringing massive data storage to students and faculty excited about a cloudy future at purdue university and emc bringing massive data storage to students and faculty west lafayette ind   comedian george carlin famously observed that all you need in life is a place to put your stuff for college students where to put their digital stuff including materials developed through their academic careers their many favorite photos and a multitude of other digital files can be a problem  it s an even bigger problem for researchers and instructors who may have enormous data files that need to be managed curated and analyzed  a new service at purdue however called boilerbackpack will give students faculty and staff 100 gigabytes of personal storage so everyone at purdue will have a large amount of space to store their digital stuff  purdue and emc corp are embarking on a five year relationship that will both address the issue of where students and faculty can put their digital files as well as develop solutions that can be adapted throughout higher education   when we looked to solve our data management and storage issues we wanted to look well beyond current practices and work to develop new solutions that can move science forward and improve student success says gerry mccartney chief information officer faculty member of the college of technology at purdue and the olga oesterle england professor of information technology   emc is the only corporation we talked to that had the capability to both address our current data storage needs and to partner with us to develop new technologies to improve data management   purdue is naming emc as one of its foundational it partners a group that includes intel hp and cisco foundational it partners work with the university in developing new technologies to be used in higher education and scientific discovery  the purdue partnership fits well with emc s goal of transforming it says pat gelsinger president and chief operating officer of emc information infrastructure products   the amount of digital information in the world will grow forty four fold this decade and in some academic disciplines such as bioinformatics datasets have become so large that they defy the ability of conventional forms of information technology to store manage analyze and gather important insights from them gelsinger says   emc s partnership with purdue is designed to advance new technology architectures and algorithms to deal with the challenges of all of this big data   for faculty and students at purdue the most visible and immediate benefit of the agreement will be in place when they return for classes in the fall of 2012 with the launch of the boilerbackpack service  the service will be similar to other popular cloud data services which typically offer between 2 gb to 7gb of free storage like those services backpack will allow students and faculty to sync files access those files from any computer and share files or folders with others  boilerbackpack apps will be available for android smartphones apple iphones and ipads as well as apps for windows and macintosh desktop computers  as with the commercial services boilerbackpack users will be able to purchase additional storage space if needed and the university is exploring ways to allow students to continue to use the service after they graduate   we ll announce specific details of the service as it launches in august but we re pleased to offer our students and faculty a needed resource that they wouldn t find at this scale on any other campus mccartney says  beyond the cloud storage service for the purdue community emc and purdue will work together in several specific ways emc and purdue will jointly develop a new architecture for research data management and curation   emc and purdue will work to develop new technologies to ingest analyze transfer and manage enormous research data sets especially in the field of bioinformatics   with emc s assistance purdue will begin building a repository of all purdue intellectual property research engineers and scientists from both organizations will work together on academic papers and presentations as well as presentations at trade conferences  the purdue emc relationship is needed to address the challenges and opportunities of using data analysis of massive data sets so called big data to gain insights and forecast outcomes by both researchers and students at purdue  purdue has been a leader in using data sets to improve student success and retention with its signals data analytics program big data will be to the next decade what the internet was to the 1990s and early 2000s mccartney says   over the next ten years it will change businesses and education in ways that we can t imagine right now with this partnership we re positioning purdue to be a leader in these changes   our foundational it partner companies have not only committed to provide excellent products and service to purdue but they have also committed to work with us to develop technologies to speed the pace of scientific discoveries and to improve the rate of student success in higher education mccartney says   emc is exactly the kind of company we are looking to partner with in this effort and because we will be advancing data science this relationship has the potential to change every market that uses the internet   '

aS' extension specialist offers reminders advice for winter wheat planting west lafayette ind now that corn and soybean harvest are well underway some indiana farmers also should be thinking about planting their winter wheat crops says a purdue extension wheat specialist  winter wheat a crop that can help manage fields with drainage issues in the spring and bring in extra revenue is usually planted directly after fall harvest to allow time for emergence before the plant goes dormant during cold weather months   wheat is a good option for a number of reasons shaun casteel said in the northeast part of the state where poorly drained soils can cause problems in the spring wheat can be used to reduce the pressure of planting corn or soy across that landscape   in the southwest part of the state there s a long enough growing season to offer farmers another potential stream of revenue farmers can use double cropping and get both beans and wheat in  wheat also provides a nice break in normal corn to soybean crop rotations casteel said the timing of wheat planting usually depends on three factors corn and soybean harvest weather and hessian fly free dates  since wheat planting follows harvest casteel said it s always a good idea to start with as clean a field as possible in terms of weeds and to correct nutritional deficiencies  if farmers are planting wheat following corn the crop residue could be a source of disease for the wheat this year weather conditions have been favorable for gibberella also known as fusarium graminearum in wheat ear rot of corn in some fields  the fungus left behind in corn residue can transfer to a subsequent wheat crop where it can cause head scab a disease that can reduce yields and damage grain quality  the good news for wheat farmers is that after a flash drought in parts of indiana much of the state has had rain recently fortunately most parts of the state got some rain over the last couple weeks so we re starting to get a little bit of a recharge in soil moisture at least in the upper portion of the soil casteel said   if we have good soil moisture at planting the crop will be off to a good start for stand establishment casteel also said farmers need to plant wheat after hessian fly free dates which range from sept  22 in northern indiana to oct 9 in southern indiana it s best to plant after those fly free dates or within 10 days or so of that date  the yield potential will likely drop if wheat is planted several weeks after that point it s a balancing act he said hessian flies are mosquitolike in appearance and feed on green plant growth including developing wheat plants  more information about wheat including planting considerations and growing season management can be found in purdue extension s wheat field guide available through purdue extension s the education store at http www the education store com search id 448 copies are 5 each '

learning in cancer chronic disease prevention west lafayette ind   the discovery learning research center is partnering with a purdue university basic medical sciences professor to advance a research project for interdisciplinary and distance learning based on the prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases  sophie leli vre the 2012 faculty fellow for the discovery learning research center and a college of veterinary medicine professor is leading the effort to educate and focus the attention of researchers on the little studied field of preventative medicine   my goal is to develop a learning system across disciplines on primary prevention of breast cancer to facilitate the design of multidisciplinary research projects among scholars and prepare future scholars for interdisciplinary and international work in public health leli vre said  leli vre pronounced le lee yea vre believes that primary prevention research is underrepresented in the scientific community  her proposal for a distance learning program was intended to correct this by exposing a large number of college science students across many universities to the current state of the research  future members of the scientific community are drawn from this pool so this should result in a greater awareness and representation of this field  currently leli vre is studying the development and behavior of both normal and cancerous cells using a three dimensional culture that permits the architectural mimicry of physiologically relevant tissue  in particular this culturing method allows her to study the effect of polarity the way cells organize themselves to make certain structures face certain directions on the development of tumors  her laboratory also examines how the genome of cells is affected by the organization of cell components in the nucleus in relation to tissue architecture   most of those who study cancer use already cancerous cells for their research in primary prevention research you start with normal cells to see how they become abnormal said leli vre who also is associate director of discovery groups for the purdue center for cancer research  leli vre who also co leads the international breast cancer and nutrition project ibcn said this course was piloted in 2010 and she is now working with purdue anthropology professor ellen gruenbaum   this project serves the mission that the discovery learning research center has set to impact a global community by fostering the development of a large scale interdisciplinary program focused on breast cancer prevention said center director gabriela weaver   it involves many disciplines in the areas of science technology engineering and mathematics stem and its goal is to promote learning in public health issues with translational research impact and the potential to influence educational policies across the globe   leli vre and connie weaver distinguished professor of foods and nutrition at purdue lead the multinational ibcn to learn more about the role that diet and other environmental factors can play to promote or prevent this disease  involving the world health organization and the international agency for research on cancer ibcn is focusing initial efforts on the united states and ghana as well as france japan uruguay and lebanon  its annual conference returns to the purdue campus on oct 10 12 lebanon is scheduled to host the 2013 conference purdue hosted the inaugural conference in 2010 and france was host in 2011  through the project launched in 2010 each country has a dedicated research team focused on a number of milestones and allows scientists to study worldwide diversity in breast cancer rates dietary patterns and cultural contexts  a native of france leli vre earned her doctorate in veterinary medicine from the university of louvain in belgium in 1990 and her doctorate in cancer pharmacology in 1995 from the university of paris vi  leli vre who has been a purdue faculty member since 2000 also earned a master s degree in law health and ethics in 2008 from the university of rennes i in partnership with the school of public health in france  purdue s discovery

aS' farmers landlords enter lease renegotiations as fall approaches west lafayette ind now that harvest is underway many farmers and landlords might be negotiating renegotiating or terminating lease agreements for the 2014 crop year  farmers like to know as early as possible which land they will rent the following year and under what terms so they can make fertilizer seed fuel and other input decisions immediately following harvest  but landlords who face a nov 30 deadline for lease terminations in the state of indiana sometimes want to wait until closer to the deadline so they have a better idea of what farm incomes might look like in the coming year   tenants like to know by september about land to lease for 2014 if they don t already have a lease arrangement for a particular farm or parcel said gerry harrison purdue extension agricultural economist   however a landlord might want to wait until november if there is doubt about the lease terms for 2013 the outlook for 2014 in november might be much different than in september of the current year   one lease arrangement that might suit both parties is a flexible lease in this type of agreement terms are included to address actual variations in crop yields or prices in determining a final rent payment harrison said  if a landlord or tenant is uncertain about continuing with the current terms of a lease arrangement such as the rent rate harrison said it s best to start renegotiations with a notice to quit or terminate a lease   from litigation in indiana in 2012 it would be careless to deal with anything other than a written notice properly delivered to end the current lease and to open up negotiation for new lease terms he said   to give notice to terminate an existing lease does not need to imply the tenant and landowner can t reach a new agreement and tenants who have a lease in place for the coming year might be wise to revisit the arrangement with the landlord   if there is no more than a comment or oral notice that a new rent or other new lease terms need to be agreed to the parties to the lease might find that they are under the same terms for the 2014 lease   the only time tenants and landlords are not entitled to a written notice to quit is when the initial lease agreement is a term lease that specifically states it can be terminated orally  according to harrison both tenants and landlords can protect themselves by consulting farm attorneys to end current lease agreements and set up new ones  purdue extension offers free resources to help farmers and landowners better understand farmland leases through the education store at http www the education store com those publications include legal aspects of indiana farmland leases and federal tax considerations written by harrison  it can be downloaded by visiting the above url and searching for ec 713 w indiana cash farm lease written by purdue extension agricultural economist craig dobbins  this publication helps farmers and landlords put lease agreements in writing and includes a blank cash lease form it also can be downloaded through the education store by searching for ec 257 w   '

aS' focus on color means white veggies dropped like a hot potato west lafayette ind colorful vegetables are promoted as key to a healthy diet but white vegetables especially potatoes shouldn t be forgotten according to a purdue university expert   potatoes are a great source for potassium and only 3 percent of american adults consume the recommended daily intake for this mineral that s essential to healthy blood pressure says connie weaver distinguished professor of nutrition science potatoes are often discounted from being healthy because of how they are cooked topped or the amount consumed but when prepared in a healthy way potatoes are nutritious  people need to remember that white veggies have a place at the table too in addition to potatoes other white vegetables often neglected are cauliflower turnips onions parsnips mushrooms corn and kohlrabi  these vegetables and related topics such as ambiguity regarding classification of white vegetables and limitations of color as measure of nutritional content are published this month in the advances in nutrition journal supplement white vegetables an forgotten source of nutrients the journal is published by the american society for nutrition and highlights research reviews in the field  weaver is editor of the journal supplement on white vegetables and she served as chair for the june 2012 white vegetables roundtable  the roundtable was funded by the alliance for potato research and education it s recommended that the variety of fruits and vegetables consumed daily should include dark green and orange vegetables but no such recommendation exists for white vegetables even though they are rich in fiber potassium and magnesium weaver says   overall americans are not eating enough vegetables and promoting white vegetables some of which are common and affordable may be a pathway to increasing vegetable consumption in general   the daily recommendation is 4 5 cups of fruits and vegetables in a 2 000 calorie diet but americans consume less than half of that or about 1 8 cups  in 2004 the adequate intake for potassium was set at 4 700 milligrams a day but the average adult intake is about half that amount  potassium is one four nutrients identified by the dietary guidelines for americans as lacking in daily diets western diets have led to a decrease in potassium with fewer fruits and vegetables and at the same time there s been an increase in sodium consumption because people eat more processed foods says weaver who is an expert in mineral bioavailability calcium metabolism and bone health  while potatoes are one of the highest sources of dietary potassium when processed they are often higher in salt while potassium improves blood flow too much salt increases blood pressure making the vascular system work harder   the relationship between potassium and sodium is interesting because how the two work together may influence risk of cardiovascular disease weaver says   the human body needs both but today s problem is sodium consumption is up and potassium is down because potassium to sodium intake ratios are more strongly related to cardiovascular disease risk than

nutrient by the dietary guidelines for americans 2010 advisory committee  the committee concluded that there was a moderate body of evidence for the association between potassium intake and blood pressure reduction in adults which in turn influences of risk of stroke and coronary heart disease  evidence is also accumulating for the protective effect of adequate dietary potassium on age related bone loss and on reduction of kidney stones  these benefits depend on organic anions associated with potassium as occurs in foods such as vegetables in contrast to similar blood pressure lowering benefits of potassium chloride  benefits to blood pressure and bone health may occur at levels below current recommendations for potassium intake especially from diet but dose response trials are needed to conform to this  nevertheless intakes considerably above current levels are needed for optimal health and studies evaluating small increases in fruit and vegetable intake on bone and heart outcomes for short periods have had disappointing results  in modern societies western diets have led to a decrease in potassium intake with reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables with a concomitant increase in sodium consumption through increased consumption of processed foods  consumption of white vegetables is associated with decreased risk of stroke possibly related to their high potassium content potatoes are the highest source of dietary potassium but addition of salt should be limited  low potassium to sodium intake ratios are more strongly related to cardiovascular disease

aS' formula will help when estimating soybean yield potential west lafayette ind soybean producers can easily get an idea of the yield potential of their crops with a purdue extension soybean specialist s calculation method  soybean yield potential is built on many factors including the genetics selected management decisions during the season and the weather  yield components of soybeans are pods seed size and number of seeds per pod individual plant production varies and every field will vary based on pests soils fertility and other factors said shaun casteel   but i ve simplified the process of estimating soybean yields so that producers can scout multiple areas quickly while maintaining representative estimates   casteel s system is based on estimated yield in one ten thousandth of an acre the basic formula involves multiplying the number of pods by the number of seeds per pod then dividing that result by the seed size factor  that calculation will show the estimated bushels per acre to calculate producers first need to count the number of pods in one ten thousandth of an acre an area determined by a 21 inch length of a row of plants and how far apart the rows were planted   nearly 90 percent of our indiana soybean acres are planted in 30 15 or 7 5 inch rows so just remember that each count needs to be 21 inches long casteel said   you will count the number of pods in one row for 30 inch width two rows for 15 inch and four rows for 7 5 inch producers should count the number of pods that are at stage r5 or higher when they can see seeds  next they must determine the number of seeds per pod casteel said using the average of 2 5 seeds per pod is best because there can be a range of 1 4 seeds per pod   this value is conservative since we don t know exactly how the rest of the season will finish casteel said the third step is to calculate seed size factor  casteel said the starting point is seed size factor 18 equaling about 3 000 seeds per pound if you expect larger seeds from late season rains you would divide by a lower seed size factor such as 15 which equals about 2 500 seeds per pound he said   if the field has late season stress such as a lack of water you would divide by a higher seed size factor like 21 or 3 500 seeds per pound   the three values number of pods in stage r5 or higher number of seeds per pod and seed size factor go into casteel s equation  for example 250 pods times 2 5 seeds per pod divided by a seed size factor 15 equals 41 7 bushels per acre fair soybean growth with limited pod retention but with good late season moisture will result in a fair crop  although producers can start estimating yields as soybeans enter the r5 stage the estimates will be more accurate as soybeans develop and enter r6 or full seed  if soybeans are just coming into r6 casteel said the yield potential still depends on pod retention and seed size the weather is an important contributor to yield potential and dry conditions over the past 4 5 weeks have lowered yield potential in some fields   reductions in excessive heat and the return of rain helped yield potentials more in seed size than pod retention assuming the soybeans are into r6 and beginning to drop leaves casteel said   if fields are green soybean yield potentials could improve if fields are losing foliage yield gains will be very limited '

aS' high nitrogen rates increase micronutrient uptake storage in corn west lafayette ind a purdue university study shows that high yielding modern corn hybrids take up not only more nitrogen from soil but more micronutrients such as zinc iron manganese and copper  nitrogen fertilizer rates also influence how much of these nutrients are stored in the grain at harvest growers may need to use fertilizers to meet the increased micronutrient requirements of hybrid corn in high yield systems especially if soil nutrient levels are too low   this study raises the question of whether we need to pay more attention to micronutrients in fertilizer management said tony vyn  purdue professor of agronomy and co author of the study in high yield systems it s not just that corn requires more macronutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus which is what farmers normally think about more micronutrients are needed as well  if you have soil that is deficient in micronutrients you could be limiting your yields though micronutrients are essential for optimum plant growth and reproductive development current management practices rarely take them into account as growers often assume that soil nutrient concentrations for these nutrients are adequate  but in modern crop production systems deficiencies could occur vyn said for many years we didn t have to worry about micronutrients he said   but if you re in a cash crop situation where you re producing bigger plants and more grain you are exporting more micronutrients away from the field at harvest  if you re not replacing them the soil is going to be depleted over time soil factors such as ph and moisture can also influence micronutrient availability said ignacio ciampitti co author of the study and assistant professor at kansas state university nutrient availability is more complex than soil nutrient concentrations ciampitti said   nutrient availability is also related to the plant s ability to take up each nutrient at the soil root interface in the second part of a study on how modern corn hybrids post 1990 absorb and allocate nutrients under contemporary management practices vyn and ciampitti measured how simultaneous increases in the number of plants per acre and nitrogen rates affected the concentration of zinc copper iron and manganese in two hybrids of corn  vyn said the influence of plant density on the uptake of micronutrients was relatively minor even at high crowding levels in that higher plant density resulted in similar yields as medium and low densities  but as nitrogen rates increased yields rose and corn plants took up a substantially greater amount of micronutrients and allocated more micronutrients to the ears   from a human nutrition viewpoint there s always a concern that increasing yields will dilute the nutritional quality of corn vyn said   but as long as soil concentrations of nutrients are sufficient higher yields tend to mean more micronutrients are concentrated in the grain not less   growers are not used to thinking about how much zinc leaves the field when they harvest grain corn vyn said but that s part of the management equation that has to be considered   at high plant density 42 000 plants per acre and high nitrogen rates 200 pounds per acre 58 percent of zinc taken up by corn hybrids was removed in the grain compared with 31 percent of copper 18 percent of iron and 15 percent of manganese  vyn and ciampitti also observed differences in when micronutrients are absorbed and where they are stored in the corn plant zinc is taken up throughout the season and is primarily stored in the stems during the vegetative stage while iron is allocated to the leaves  copper and manganese are distributed to both leaves and stems and are taken up mostly before the flowering period to prevent deficiencies vyn suggests growers add zinc to bulk fertilizer with phosphorus which has a similar uptake pattern or put it in a starter while manganese can be supplied in a foliar application where necessary  growers usually can rely on soil for sufficient levels of iron and copper he said '

aS' hurt falling feed prices to push hogs back to profitable west lafayette ind hog production is returning to profitability as feed prices fall and a reduction in slaughter numbers seems to show that producers are noticing purdue extension agricultural economist chris hurt says  major drought in 2012 ransacked the nation s feed crops sending livestock feed prices sky high and driving hog producers to quickly send animals to slaughter  with a large yielding corn crop expected this year feed prices have been decreasing which has turned around the outlook for hog profits   this year the hog outlook is almost the opposite of what it was last year hurt said feed prices especially corn have been falling sharply  the hog outlook is profitable so producers are more likely to be retaining or building the breeding herd and weights are expected to increase as producers hold onto market hogs longer to gain profits on every pound   the most recent hog numbers available from the u s department of agriculture from the september hogs and pigs report showed that hog inventories are unchanged to somewhat larger compared to a year ago   yet slaughter in recent weeks has been very low seemingly indicating a divergence from usda s reading hurt said between mid august and the end of september slaughter rates dropped by an average of more than 5 percent and weekly slaughter rates have been down anywhere from 3 to 10 percent  one explanation for the perceived difference in usda s inventory numbers and slaughter rates could be related to animal deaths from the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus or pedv  the usda doesn t track pedv deaths so hurt said those numbers aren t known for certain and it could be several months before hog markets are able to sort out the effects of the virus  another explanation for seemingly low slaughter rates could be attributed to the way the industry and markets evaluate herd numbers with year to year comparisons  hogs went to market at higher than normal rates in 2012 because high feed prices meant the cost of production was higher than producers could sustain   what is being viewed as a very low slaughter in recent weeks might be due to an aberration in the slaughter numbers a year ago hurt said   the unusually high slaughter in the late summer of 2012 was being driven by the drought record high feed prices and large anticipated losses provided a grave outlook for the industry and some producers began to adjust   those adjustments included an increase in sow slaughter and in some cases total herd liquidation a year ago now that the outlook has improved breeding herd expansion has likely started and hogs are being held to higher weights  these factors mean that fewer animals are headed to market right now and prices have strengthened given low slaughter numbers cash prices of hogs have been sharply higher than in the same period in 2012 when they averaged 55 per live hundredweight hurt said   with lower slaughter this year they have averaged about 68 since mid august higher cash hog prices combined with lower feed costs are the important drivers for a profitable outlook over the next 12 months  hurt said eastern corn belt live hog prices are expected to average in the mid 60s in the final quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014  spring and summer prices are expected to move slightly higher with the cost of production estimated at 57 per hundredweight hurt said cash prices in the mid to high 60s would mean profits of more than 20 per head   these profits will enable producers to recover losses of about the same amount in the past year due to the drought he said '

aS' hurt higher corn soybean yields put indiana grain industry back to work west lafayette ind a return to better crop production weather and larger corn and soybean yields have combined to give much of indiana s grain handling industry a full workload after the 2012 drought left it with little grain to store transport or process  indiana has nearly 1 3 billion bushels of grain storage capacity and according to purdue university estimates about 30 percent of it sat idle last year  that represents the largest underutilization of the state s grain storage capacity since the 1988 drought the annual value of the indiana grain industry at the farm level is nearly 10 billion so to not use 30 percent of the capacity had considerable economic impacts across rural communities in terms of lost jobs and reduced hours for workers said chris hurt purdue extension agricultural economist  grain storage is a fixed capacity meaning the associated costs continue even if there isn t enough grain production to use it all  that capacity has to be in place for high production years but in low production years similar to 2012 it comes with continuing costs and no returns  the economic implications weren t limited to just grain storage though processors of biofuels food animal feed and other products made from corn and soybeans also slowed production because of a lack of grain and extremely high prices for grain that was available   indiana is a major grain processing state so those industries are now returning that idled capacity to work after periods of shutdown in the past year hurt said  the drivers behind that return to work are a corn crop that s expected to be near a record high 1 billion bushels this year and near normal soybean production around 250 million bushels   we expect about a 5 percent underutilization and it turns out that over the last several decades that s been about normal he said  a link to a video clip of purdue university agricultural economist chris hurt talking about how this year s crops will produce more business for the grain handling industry following last year s drought is available at http www youtube com watch v _3yqr_p1ywe feature youtu be agriculture news page'

aS' invasive asian carp may be able to spread further than once thought a collection of carp eggs collected by goforth s team photo provided by reuben goforth download photo west lafayette ind those concerned about the spread of asian carp in midwest rivers had some comfort in the expectation that varieties of these invasive fish could only invade a restricted range of river conditions until now  a purdue university study shows that asian carp are spawning in waters generally thought too narrow or slow moving and while spawning was thought to end sometime in july researchers have found evidence of fish spawning far upstream and eggs drifting in water as late as september in the wabash river in indiana   it looks like the carp can probably become established in a wider range of environmental conditions than once thought said reuben goforth an assistant professor of forestry and natural resources   while the presence of eggs indicates successful spawning by these fishes in new areas it s not known yet whether those eggs would be successful in surviving to adulthood   silver carp black carp grass carp and bighead carp known collectively as asian carp are spreading throughout midwest rivers  these invasive species may be outcompeting native species that are commercially and recreationally desirable the fish can weigh up to 60 pounds and silver carp jump out of water when disturbed sometimes causing injuries to boaters and others using rivers and streams  while conservation workers and scientists are working hard to contain asian carp there is still concern that they could spread to other tributaries if they get into the great lakes  models used to predict where and when asian carp might spawn have been heavily based on information gathered from native habitats in asian rivers and streams  but goforth said there is strong evidence that the carp are able to reproduce in waters and conditions that were not expected the reason truly invasive species are so successful is because they overcome obstacles goforth said   when you base their limitations on what happens in their native ecosystems it s a good start but it may be a good idea to go back and take this new data to recalculate more precise limits based on these new understandings   goforth said it had been believed that heavier spring rain that increased water depth and flow in rivers was necessary for successful spawning  but last year s severe drought limited stream flows and asian carp eggs were found in shallow and narrow portions of the wabash river once thought incapable of supporting the species   we didn t have the normal spring floods and they spawned anyway goforth said those changes in water flow and depth might be a cue to spawn but they re not something that s absolutely necessary   goforth said his laboratory would work on determining what allows asian carp to adapt to conditions unlike those in their native habitats   what we don t know is whether they have the ability to acclimate to those conditions or whether there is a sort of micro evolution going on that allows them to adapt to these conditions he said  the indiana department of natural resources and the u s geological survey s upper midwest environmental sciences center collaborated with purdue researchers  their findings were published in the journal freshwater biology the indiana dnr u s environmental protection agency and great lakes restoration initiative funded the research  phenotypic plasticity in the spawning traits of bigheaded carp hypophthalmichthys spp in novel ecosystems 1 bigheaded carp including both silver  hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead h nobilis carp are successful invasive fishes that threaten global freshwater biodiversity  high phenotypic plasticity probably contributes to their success in novel ecosystems although evidence of plasticity in several spawning traits has hitherto been largely anecdotal or speculative  2 we collected drifting eggs from a midwestern usa river from june to september 2011 and from april to june 2012 to investigate the spawning traits of bigheaded carp in novel ecosystems  3 unlike reports from the native range the presence of drifting bigheaded carp eggs was not related to changes in hydrological regime or mean daily water temperature  bigheaded carp also exhibited protracted spawning since we found drifting eggs throughout the summer and as late as 1 september 2011  finally we detected bigheaded carp eggs in a river reach where the channel is c 30 m wide with a catchment area of 4579 km2 the smallest stream in which spawning has yet been documented  4 taken with previous observations of spawning traits that depart from those observed within the native ranges of both bighead and silver carp our findings provide direct evidence that bigheaded carp exhibit plastic spawning traits in novel ecosystems that may facilitate invasion and establishment in a wider range of river conditions than previously envisaged  '

aS' legal levels of atrazine alter neuroendocrine reproductive genes in zebrafish a purdue study found that an agricultural herbicide alters reproductive and neuroendocrine genes during embryonic development in fish a finding that will help establish a genetic profile to determine atrazine s specific effects according to jennifer freeman an assistant professor of toxicology in the school of health sciences   purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind a purdue university study found an agricultural herbicide alters reproductive and neuroendocrine genes during embryonic development in fish a finding that will help establish a genetic profile to determine atrazine s specific effects   the exact connection to health outcomes is not defined but we found gene alterations in our animal model when exposed to the level of atrazine that is deemed safe for drinking water said jennifer freeman an assistant professor of toxicology in the school of health sciences also of concern was an increase in head length in the study s young zebrafish when exposed to low doses of this widely used herbicide   the federally approved amount of atrazine is 3 parts per billion in drinking water the amount is currently under review by the environmental protection agency because the herbicide is considered an endocrine disrupting chemical and potential carcinogen  while atrazine is confirmed by many animal studies as harmful to endocrine systems its specific effects are still unknown freeman said  atrazine is used to kill broadleaf and grassy weeds in crops such as corn especially in the midwest the chemical is sometimes used on residential lawns in the southeast  this study partially funded by the national institutes of health and published by toxicological sciences journal focused on exact gene changes  the researchers tested atrazine at three levels 0 3 ppb 3 ppb and 30 ppb by exposing developing zebrafish embryos the 3 ppb level is the current safe level in drinking water and the larger amount of atrazine tested represents what a worker may be exposed to or may be present in surface water  by using the zebrafish model the researchers were able to focus on the 72 hour embryonic development time which mirrors human prenatal development  the researchers started by evaluating the more than 35 000 genes in the zebrafish s genome they found that two genes cyp17a1 and samhd1 were changed in all three treatments cyp17a1 plays a role in biosynthesis of steroid hormones and the conversion of androgens to estrogen and samhd1 controls immune function also of concern was that 42 of the genes including cyp17a1 and samhd1 were affected in the 30 ppb treatments as well as in the 3 ppb treatment  the lh gene which produces the hormone that triggers ovulation is another example of an affected gene at both 3 ppb and 30 ppb treatment levels   there is a connection between the current legal level of atrazine and higher concentrations that need further study freeman said   specifically we need to focus on the 3 ppb level to determine if it is safe or if these changes play a role in adverse health effects   the affected genes in this study correlate with findings in other studies but freeman and her team also identified a number of novel genes that are linked with functions previously associated with atrazine toxicity but for which genetic targets are not yet known   identification is just the beginning freeman said the goal is to understand the genetic pathways and how they are altered to see what s happening in the big picture   another difference in the purdue study was the increase in head length of the exposed zebrafish this was a subtle change for the fish larva at all exposure levels that we were able to see with finer measurements but not with the eye alone freeman said   this morphological change in the zebrafish indicates that low levels of atrazine can stimulate development and alter the physiology of exposed individuals   the researchers also will be looking at the long term effects of the fish exposed to these three atrazine levels as they grow and reproduce to link the developmental gene changes to adverse health outcomes  the epa working with the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act scientific advisory panel continues to evaluate scientific research regarding a potential link between atrazine and cancer in humans  according to the epa website even though the panel agreed with epa that the epidemiologic evidence does not strongly suggest a link between atrazine and cancer the panel did not agree that a lack of strong evidence justifies a conclusion that atrazine is not likely to be a human carcinogen   freeman said continuing to investigate changes in genes associated with cancer is critical because there needs to be more information before determining if atrazine is a human carcinogen   in our study a number of gene changes were associated with cancer pathways too and while related gene pathways for cancer are involved we are not saying atrazine causes cancer she said   we know these genes are changing in some way and we need to do further targeted mechanistic studies to determine if there is a connection   the grants from the national institutes of health s national center for research resources and national institute of environmental health sciences supporting this work are shared between freeman and maria sep lveda an associate professor of forestry and natural resources  gregory weber a doctoral student in health sciences is the paper s lead

developmental atrazine exposure in zebrafish are associated with disruption of neuroendocrine and reproductive system function  cell cycle and carcinogenesis atrazine a herbicide commonly applied to agricultural areas and a common contaminant of potable water supplies is implicated as an endocrine disrupting chemical edc and potential carcinogen  studies show that edcs can cause irreversible changes in tissue formation decreased reproductive potential obesity and cancer  the u s environmental protection agency considers an atrazine concentration of 3 ppb in drinking water safe for consumption  the specific adverse human health effects associated with a developmental atrazine exposure and the underlying genetic mechanisms of these effects are not well defined  in this study zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations to establish toxicity morphological transcriptomic and protein alterations were then assessed at 72 hours post fertilization hpf following developmental atrazine exposure at 0 0 3 3 or 30 ppb  a significant increase in head length was observed in all three atrazine treatments transcriptomic profiles revealed 21 62 and 64 genes with altered expression in the 0 3 3 and 30 ppb atrazine treatments respectively  altered genes were associated with neuroendocrine and reproductive system development function and disease cell cycle control and carcinogenesis  there was a significant overlap 42 genes between the 3 and 30 ppb differentially expressed gene lists with two of these genes cyp17a1 and samhd1 present in all three atrazine treatments  increased transcript levels were translated to significant up regulation in protein expression overall this study identifies genetic and molecular targets altered in response to a developmental atrazine exposure to further define the biological pathways and mechanisms of toxicity  '

aS'  metasurfaces to usher in new optical technologies this schematic view of a nanoantenna array a at left is an example of new plasmonic metasurfaces that are promising for various advances including a possible hyperlens that could make optical microscopes 10 times more powerful  at right b is a hyperbolic metasurface a tiny metallic grating for enhancing quantum emitters which could make possible future quantum information systems far more powerful than today s computers   birck nanotechnology center purdue university download photo west lafayette ind new optical technologies using metasurfaces capable of the ultra efficient control of light are nearing commercialization with potential applications including advanced solar cells computers telecommunications sensors and microscopes  the metasurfaces could make possible planar photonics devices and optical switches small enough to be integrated into computer chips for information processing and telecommunications said alexander kildishev associate research professor of electrical and computer engineering at purdue university   i think we know enough at this point that we can realistically start to develop prototypes of devices for some applications he said  the promise of metasurfaces is described in an article appearing friday march 15 in the journal science the article was co authored by kildishev alexandra boltasseva an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and vladimir m  shalaev scientific director of nanophotonics at purdue s birck nanotechnology center and a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering  the metasurfaces are extremely thin films of metamaterials assemblies that contain features patterns or elements such as tiny antennas or alternating layers of oxides that enable an unprecedented control of light  under development for about 15 years the metamaterials owe their unusual potential to precision design on the scale of nanometers  optical nanophotonic circuits might harness clouds of electrons called surface plasmons to manipulate and control the routing of light in devices too tiny for conventional lasers  the metasurfaces are typically created using electron beam lithography or focused ion beam milling and may also be made of materials that are compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing and industrial processes   that is one of the attractive features of metasurfaces kildishev said if we use certain types of plasmonic material they can be integrated into existing semiconductor processes which makes them practical for commercialization   plasmonic metamaterials are promising for various advances including a possible hyperlens that could make optical microscopes 10 times more powerful advanced chemical sensors new types of light harvesting systems for more efficient solar cells computers and consumer electronics that use light instead of electronic signals to process information and a cloak of invisibility   if you apply voltage the optical properties of graphene change and if you couple a graphene layer with a metasurface these properties then change dramatically kildishev said  metasurfaces could make it possible to use single photons the tiny particles that make up light for switching and routing in future computers  while using photons would dramatically speed up computers and telecommunications conventional photonic devices cannot be miniaturized because the wavelength of light is too large to fit in tiny components needed for integrated circuits  nanostructured metamaterials however could make it possible to reduce the size of photons and the wavelength of light allowing the creation of new types of nanophotonic devices shalaev said  some of the new materials may have applications involving near infrared light the range of the spectrum critical for telecommunications and fiberoptics  other materials also might work for light in the spectrum s visible range unlike natural materials metamaterials may possess an index of refraction less than one or less than zero  refraction occurs as electromagnetic waves including light bend when passing from one material into another it causes the bent stick in water effect which occurs when a stick placed in a glass of water appears crooked when viewed from the outside  being able to create materials with an index of refraction that s negative or between one and zero promises a range of potential breakthroughs in a new field called transformation optics  development of new technologies using metamaterials has been hindered by two major limitations too much light is lost or absorbed by metals such as silver and gold contained in the metamaterials and the materials need to be more precisely tuned so that they possess the proper index of refraction  ultrathin metasurfaces made of novel low loss plasmonic material components is a promising way to address this challenge researchers are working to replace silver and gold in materials that are created either by making semiconductors more metallic by adding metal impurities to them or adding non metallic elements to metals in effect making them less metallic  examples of these materials include transparent conducting oxides and titanium nitride boltasseva said note to journalists a copy of the article is available by contacting the science press package team at 202 326 6440  scipak aaas org metamaterials or engineered materials with rationally designed subwavelength scale building blocks allow us to control the behavior of physical fields in optical microwave radio acoustic heat transfer and other applications with flexibility and performance that are unattainable with naturally available materials  in turn metasurfaces planar ultrathin metamaterials extend these capabilities even further optical metasurfaces offer the fascinating possibility of controlling light with surface confined flat components  in the planar photonics concept it is the reduced dimensionality of the optical metasurfaces that enables new physics and therefore leads to functionalities and applications that are distinctly different from those achievable with bulk multilayer metamaterials  here we review the progress in developing optical metasurfaces that has occurred over the past few years with an eye toward the promising future directions in the field  '

aS' nanoparticles ph phoresis could improve cancer drug delivery west lafayette ind researchers have developed a concept to potentially improve delivery of drugs for cancer treatment using nanoparticles that concentrate and expand in the presence of higher acidity found in tumor cells  the concept involves using nanoparticles made of weak polybases compounds that expand when transported into environments mimicking tumor cells which have a higher acidity than surrounding tissues  the researchers used sophisticated modeling to show how the particles would accumulate in regions of higher acidity and remain there long enough to delivery anticancer drugs   this phenomenon which we term ph phoresis may provide a useful mechanism for improving the delivery of drugs to cancer cells in solid tumor tissues said you yeon won an associate professor of chemical engineering at purdue university solutions with a ph less than 7 are said to be acidic and those with a higher ph are basic or alkaline  the ph phoresis concept hinges on using synthetic polymer micelles tiny drug delivery spheres that harbor medications in their inner core and contain an outer shell made of a material that has been shown to expand dramatically as the ph changes from alkaline to acidic  a twofold size increase could result in a similar increase in the efficiency of drug delivery to tumors such an effect would be a game changer by delivering the proper dose of anticancer drugs inside tumor cells won said   this ph phoresis concept also could be combined readily within other established drug delivery methodologies making it potentially practical for medical application   the concept is described in a research paper that will appear in the journal of controlled release on july 15 and an unedited version appeared online june 19  the paper was written by won and doctoral student hoyoung lee findings showed how the micelles expansion is optimized in the specific ph in tumor cells  the researchers demonstrated that the highest degree of micelle swelling in tumors needs to occur when there is a ph of about 7 0 plus or minus 0 5 for optimal delivery of drugs to tumor tissue   solid tumors have a significantly lower extracellular ph about 6 5 6 9 compared to normal tissue which has an average ph of 7 4 won said  the weak polybases in the micelles contain molecules called amines which are made of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms the micelles swell at lower ph due to the increased protonation or the addition of protons to nitrogen atoms in the amines  because the protons are positively charged the like charged amines repel each other causing the nanoparticles to expand the positive charge slows the movement of micelles out of tumor tissue which would cause the nanoparticles to accumulate inside the tumor mass long enough to enter tumor cells and release anticancer drugs   this concept is straightforward to understand yet no one recognized it previously won said and it took us a while to put this description on a mathematical footing  to do that we had to modify the famous fick s first law diffusion equation the law derived by physician and physiologist adolf fick in 1855 describes how molecules diffuse from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration  the micelles also are coated with protective varnish so that they might remain intact long enough to reach tumor sites where they would expand and then biodegrade  more research is needed to determine how well the approach could enhance drug delivery but the ph phoresis concept developed by won and his student represents a step in developing nanomedicine techniques in drug delivery he said  the research has been funded by the national science foundation and purdue s school of chemical engineering support also came from the global rnai carrier initiative program fellowship from the biomedical research institute of the korea institute of science and technology kist and also the research fellowship from purdue s bindley bioscience center  note to journalists an electronic copy of the research paper is available from emil venere 765 494 4709 venere purdue edu 3 center for theragnosis biomedical research institute korea institute of science and technology we propose a new concept describing how nanoparticles composed of weak polybases such as polyamines would behave when they are exposed to a ph gradient weak polybase containing particles will tend to accumulate preferentially in low ph regions under a ph gradient environment  this phenomenon which we term ph phoresis may provide a useful mechanism for improving the delivery of drugs to cancer cells in solid tumor tissues  '

aS' new 4 d transistor is preview of future computers this image taken with a transmission electron microscope shows the cross section of a new type of transistor shaped like a christmas tree that was created by researchers at purdue and harvard universities  the transistor is made from tiny nanowires of a material called indium gallium arsenide which could replace silicon within a decade   purdue university image download photo west lafayette ind a new type of transistor shaped like a christmas tree has arrived just in time for the holidays but the prototype won t be nestled under the tree along with the other gifts   it s a preview of things to come in the semiconductor industry said peide peter ye a professor of electrical and computer engineering at purdue university  researchers from purdue and harvard universities created the transistor which is made from a material that could replace silicon within a decade  each transistor contains three tiny nanowires made not of silicon like conventional transistors but from a material called indium gallium arsenide  the three nanowires are progressively smaller yielding a tapered cross section resembling a christmas tree the research builds on previous work in which the team created a 3 d structure instead of conventional flat transistors  the approach could enable engineers to build faster more compact and efficient integrated circuits and lighter laptops that generate less heat than today s  new findings show how to improve the device performance by linking the transistors vertically in parallel a one story house can hold so many people but more floors more people and it s the same thing with transistors ye said   stacking them results in more current and much faster operation for high speed computing this adds a whole new dimension so i call them 4 d   findings will be detailed in two papers to be presented during the international electron devices meeting on dec 8 12 in san francisco  one of the papers has been highlighted by conference organizers as among the most newsworthy topics and papers to be presented   the work is led by purdue doctoral student jiangjiang gu and harvard postdoctoral researcher xinwei wang the newest generation of silicon computer chips introduced this year contain transistors having a vertical 3 d structure instead of a conventional flat design  however because silicon has a limited electron mobility how fast electrons flow other materials will likely be needed soon to continue advancing transistors with this 3 d approach ye said  indium gallium arsenide is among several promising semiconductors being studied to replace silicon such semiconductors are called iii v materials because they combine elements from the third and fifth groups of the periodic table  the authors of the research papers are gu wang purdue doctoral student h wu purdue postdoctoral research associate j shao purdue doctoral student a  t neal michael j manfra purdue s william f and patty j miller associate professor of physics roy gordon harvard s thomas d  cabot professor of chemistry and ye transistors contain critical components called gates which enable the devices to switch on and off and to direct the flow of electrical current  smaller gates make faster operation possible in today s 3 d silicon transistors the length of these gates is about 22 nanometers or billionths of a meter  the 3 d design is critical because gate lengths of 22 nanometers and smaller do not work well in a flat transistor architecture  engineers are working to develop transistors that use even smaller gate lengths 14 nanometers are expected by 2015 and 10 nanometers by 2018  however size reductions beyond 10 nanometers and additional performance improvements are likely not possible using silicon meaning new materials will be needed to continue progress ye said  creating smaller transistors also will require finding a new type of insulating or dielectric layer that allows the gate to switch off  as gate lengths shrink smaller than 14 nanometers the dielectric used in conventional transistors fails to perform properly and is said to leak electrical charge when the transistor is turned off  nanowires in the new transistors are coated with a different type of composite insulator a 4 nanometer thick layer of lanthanum aluminate with an ultrathin half nanometer layer of aluminum oxide  the new ultrathin dielectric allowed researchers to create transistors made of indium gallium arsenide with 20 nanometer gates which is a milestone ye said  the work based at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park is funded by the national science foundation and the semiconductor research corp  20 80nm channel length ingaas gate all around nanowire

ss and dibl are greatly limited by the large eot of the devices 1 furthermore although lateral parallel to the wafer surface integration of nws has been demonstrated with high drive current per wire the overall current drivability of the devices is limited by the large pitch of the nws  to overcome this drive current bottleneck for the first time a top down process technology has been developed to fabricate vertically stacked normal to the wafer surface iii v nwfets similar to some explored si nwfets 2 3  we call this new type of nanowire devices iii v 4d transistors to distinguish them from iii v 3d transistors 1 which has only one vertical layer and multiple lateral wires  the experimental results in this abstract show that the drive current per wire pitch wpitch is greatly increased from 3d to 4d structure  the new device concept is very promising for future high speed low power logic and rf applications '

center hopes it can be a leader in finding solutions the purdue center for predictive materials and devices c primed and its focus on modeling for materials engineering dovetails with the national materials genome initiative mgi announced by president barack obama in 2011 this federal initiative will concentrate on developing methods to double the speed and halve the cost of creating new advanced materials  purdue s nanohub org developed by the network for computational nanotechnology and arguably the world s largest nanotechnology user facility is highlighted in the white house s national science and technology council report in june 2011 that paved the way for the mgi  the 18 page report titled materials genome initiative for global competitiveness says accelerating the pace of discovery and deployment of advanced material systems will therefore be crucial adding open innovation will play a key role in accelerating the development of advanced computational tools   the council s report goes on to say an existing system that is a good example of a first step toward open innovation is the nanohub   c primed represents a continuation and a deepening of ongoing purdue research efforts through nanohub org said gerhard klimeck  a professor of electrical and computer engineering the new discovery park research center part of 12 million in new investment by purdue s research infrastructure is led by klimeck and alejandro strachan a professor of materials engineering  other purdue investment efforts in this area include conte the nation s fastest university owned supercomputer and the center for prediction of reliability integrity and survivability of microsystems prism   our efforts will focus on ways to accelerate the time it takes to introduce advanced materials to the marketplace for everything from airplane wings solar cells and electronic devices to packaging that keeps food fresher klimeck said   that s the dream behind c primed and it s more attainable now through those efforts purdue investment totaling 12 million in the past decade has led to additional research funding totaling nearly 50 million from the national science foundation and other federal agencies for cyber platforms that support infrastructure and online content development for the nanotechnology research community   these large scale high impact projects by purdue in the past decade have set the stage for an even larger initiative that can transform materials design and device development said alan rebar director of discovery park and senior associate vice president for research at purdue   professors klimeck and strachan bring the leadership vision and spirit of collaboration to c primed that will position purdue as a key global player in addressing this nation s need to accelerate the pace of discovery and deployment of advanced material systems   a named purdue directorship honors klimeck s leadership as the inaugural reilly director of the center for predictive materials and devices  klimeck also is director of the network for computational nanotechnology and its signature nanohub org online science and engineering gateway and cyber platform projects  his research focuses on creating atomic scale models of future computer processor components and their quantum interactions strachan is a leader in developing and validating computational methods for predicting the behavior of materials and their application in technology  he is deputy director at prism we have the computational modeling that can assist us in accelerating the pace at which new materials are discovered developed and transitioned into manufactured products klimeck said   we can simultaneously drive the process through the system requirements and certification as new materials it will be a coupling of expertise interests and people with the potential for real impact to take research concepts developed together and used for a translational piece   purdue researchers have been working the past 10 years to make calculations with quantified uncertainties in what is now referred to as predictive science  these sophisticated computer simulations and models can test materials for their thermal and mechanical properties as well as their stiffness strength flexibility and weight   today i require a hundred experiments to learn something important about a material strachan said the question is can i do 10 experiments 10 very well designed experiments instead of a hundred  that requires powerful computers new simulation capabilities and a framework for decision making that combines simulations with experiments   the approach hinges on a fundamental change in how products are created by introducing a procedure known as material product co design   now when we develop a product the materials are fixed strachan said you take material a material b and material c i know the properties and i am going to pick from those  however in material product co design at the same time i am developing the airplane and the shape of the wings i am also changing the material  instead of saying polymer 1 polymer 2 polymer 3 i m optimizing everything at the same time knowing the uncertainties allows you to predict not just the mean behavior of a material but its across the board performance with enough confidence to make decisions about which designs to concentrate on strachan said   you want to be able to make decisions based on these predictions and that means you have to be able to guarantee the prediction   complementing c primed purdue is recruiting six faculty positions for research and teaching in materials engineering and predictive science  this faculty cluster hire effort is interdisciplinary and involves the colleges of engineering and science faculty will be needed with expertise in fields ranging from chemistry and materials science to mechanical engineering and physics  klimeck said advanced materials are so much a part of everyday life that it s hard for many people to understand how extremely difficult and time consuming it is to develop them  for example the lithium ion batteries common in today s laptops and portable electronic devices were first proposed in the mid 1970s but only achieved broad market adoption and use in the late 1990s  by building on demonstrated purdue research strengths in computer simulation and materials engineering c primed gives the university the critical mass necessary to compete for significant federal and industrial investments stemming from the mgi which is a part of the u s  government s new advanced manufacturing partnership we see an opportunity to set purdue apart on a global stage in an increasingly important new research and application area klimeck said   through c primed we will draw together existing strengths provide the necessary glue and seed funding and create an overall structure needed for high visibility   locating c primed in discovery park also will help purdue researchers and their national and global partners overcome the foundational challenge of multidisciplinary work klimeck said   discovery park provides us the home to establish an incentive framework for many faculty outside their traditional departmental settings he said   we also will be better positioned to attract new faculty from national research laboratories and industry who see a high value in transformative research and development   for more information on purdue s investment in research infrastructure and

natural and exploratory shape modeling by introducing novel 3 d interactions for creating modifying and manipulating 3 d shapes using arms and hands  though current design tools provide complex modeling functionality they remain non intuitive and require significant training since they segregate 3 d shapes into hierarchical 2 d inputs thus binding the user to stringent procedural steps and making modifications cumbersome  in addition the designer knows what to design when they go to cad systems and the creative exploration in design is lost we present a shape creation paradigm as an exploration of creative imagination and externalization of shapes particularly in the early phases of design  we integrate the capability of humans to express 3 d shapes via hand arm motions with traditional sweep surface representation to demonstrate rapid exploration of a rich variety of fairly complex 3 d shapes  we track the skeleton of users using the depth data provided by low cost depth sensing camera kinect our modeling tool is configurable to provide a variety of implicit constraints for shape symmetry and resolution based on the position orientation and speed of the arms  intuitive strategies for coarse and fine shape modifications are also proposed we conclusively demonstrate the creation of a wide variety of product concepts and show an average modeling time of only a few seconds while retaining the intuitiveness of communicating the design intent  '

aS' new effort to create green electronics workforce west lafayette ind the world s love affair with gadgets many of which contain hazardous materials is generating millions of tons of electronic waste annually  now purdue and tuskegee universities are leading an international effort to replace conventional electronics with more sustainable technologies and train a workforce of specialists to make the transition possible   the rapid global proliferation of smart phones laptops tablets and other electronic devices has connected the world in positive ways but the electronic waste is literally piling up said carol handwerker purdue s reinhardt schuhmann jr  professor of materials engineering we want to create materials that will allow computer components to be disassembled recycled and reused  there is a growing realization that the traditional linear model of consumption design it build it use it throw it away has long ceased being viable for electronics  that is why we proposed this innovative integrative global education and research program to educate and train a ph d workforce with an unprecedented capacity for analyzing complex dynamic systems   the new global traineeship in sustainable electronics is funded with a five year 3 2 million grant from the national science foundation  handwerker is leading the project with four co principal investigators including mahesh hosur a professor of materials science and engineering at tuskegee  the three other co principal investigators are inez hua associate director of purdue s global engineering program and a professor of civil engineering karthik ramani the donald w  feddersen professor of mechanical engineering and ananth iyer associate dean for graduate programs and purdue s susan bulkeley butler chair in operations management at the krannert school of management  researchers are working closely with the international electronics manufacturing initiative inemi a consortium of electronics manufacturers suppliers associations government agencies and universities   this collaboration will enable doctoral students and faculty to take a global supply chain perspective that integrates engineering issues and business realities and enhances research effectiveness iyer said   being linked to industry leaders and to research experts will offer us an opportunity to understand business challenges and provide impactful research solutions   at the same time programs like these are critical to industry he said industrial research has consistently decreased over the past two decades making it important for industry to aggressively encourage and support academic research programs such as this one that focus on innovation to meet technology needs   the workforce should include specialists in many disciplines from engineering and science to economics anthropology management and political science   it s not just an engineering problem it s not just a technology problem handwerker said it involves people s behavior dynamics of social systems industrial systems legislation and regulation  we will bring together all of these disciplines and people to address the complex set of issues related to sustainable electronics   more than 3 million tons of e waste were generated in 2007 in the united states with 13 6 percent collected for recycling and 86 4 percent going to landfills and incinerators  electronic products contain hazardous materials such as heavy metals and brominated flame retardants the materials can leach out of landfills into groundwater or be converted into super toxins including dioxin while being incinerated  environmental concerns have led 25 states to pass laws mandating e waste recycling because many states have laws prohibiting disposal of electronic waste in landfills the waste is incinerated or shipped to developing countries said fu zhao an assistant professor in purdue s school of mechanical engineering and division of environmental and ecological engineering   neither scenario is good from a sustainability perspective incineration is expensive and materials and energy are wasted exporting e waste to developing countries damages local environments harms people s health and is against environmental justice   researchers will work to develop nanocomposites made of natural materials for structural applications in casings and circuit boards  another thrust will be to create lignin and soy based resins for circuit board construction to replace petroleum based resins being naturally derived and plentiful these materials may offer an opportunity for low cost non fossil fuel derived materials for high performance structural applications  whether they are more environmentally benign than alternatives will depend on their life cycle environmental costs this is truly a case where the devil is in the details handwerker said  other goals include development of adhesives from marine organisms for the construction and disassembly of electronics and green replacements for brominated flame retardants   we foresee a future of increasing collaboration on many fronts hosur said we are developing a curriculum and we need to expand our research base on both campuses  the grant has strengthened the two decade long relationship that tuskegee has had with purdue in advanced materials through nsf and the u s  department of defense the first course design for global sustainability is being offered this semester at purdue and tuskegee with graduate students from management engineering and political science enrolled she said  the program will involve university partners in germany colombia china and india connected through globalhub a web site for international collaboration based on purdue s hubzero software  seven purdue graduate students and three tuskegee students are involved with a total of 28 two year fellowships funded over the five year program  cynthia williams inemi 207 871 1260

aS' new imaging technology could reveal cellular secrets this image illustrates the concept for a new type of technology that combines two biological imaging methods atomic force microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance to create a new way to study cancer cell metastasis and other disease related processes   purdue university image xin xu download photo west lafayette ind researchers have married two biological imaging technologies creating a new way to learn how good cells go bad   let s say you have a large population of cells said corey neu an assistant professor in purdue university s weldon school of biomedical engineering   just one of them might metastasize or proliferate forming a cancerous tumor we need to understand what it is that gives rise to that one bad cell   such an advance makes it possible to simultaneously study the mechanical and biochemical behavior of cells which could provide new insights into disease processes said biomedical engineering postdoctoral fellow charilaos harris mousoulis  being able to study a cell s internal workings in fine detail would likely yield insights into the physical and biochemical responses to its environment  the technology which combines an atomic force microscope and nuclear magnetic resonance system could help researchers study individual cancer cells for example to uncover mechanisms leading up to cancer metastasis for research and diagnostics  the prototype s capabilities were demonstrated by taking nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of hydrogen atoms in water findings represent a proof of concept of the technology and are detailed in a research paper that appeared online april 11 in the journal applied physics letters the paper was co authored by mousoulis research scientist teimour maleki babak ziaie a professor of electrical and computer engineering and neu   you could detect many different types of chemical elements but in this case hydrogen is nice to detect because it s abundant neu said   you could detect carbon nitrogen and other elements to get more detailed information about specific biochemistry inside a cell   an atomic force microscope afm uses a tiny vibrating probe called a cantilever to yield information about materials and surfaces on the scale of nanometers or billionths of a meter  because the instrument enables scientists to see objects far smaller than possible using light microscopes it could be ideal for studying molecules cell membranes and other biological structures  however the afm does not provide information about the biological and chemical properties of cells so the researchers fabricated a metal microcoil on the afm cantilever  an electrical current is passed though the coil causing it to exchange electromagnetic radiation with protons in molecules within the cell and inducing another current in the coil which is detected  the purdue researchers perform mechanobiology studies to learn how forces exerted on cells influence their behavior in work focusing on osteoarthritis their research includes the study of cartilage cells from the knee to learn how they interact with the complex matrix of structures and biochemistry between cells  future research might include studying cells in microfluidic chambers to test how they respond to specific drugs and environmental changes  a u s patent application has been filed for the concept the research has been funded by purdue s showalter trust fund and the national institutes of health  note to journalists journalists can obtain a copy of the research paper by contacting emil venere purdue news service at 765 494 4709  venere purdue edu atomic force microscopy coupled microcoils for cellular scale nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy we present the coupling of atomic force microscopy afm and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technologies to enable topographical mechanical and chemical profiling of biological samples  here we fabricate and perform proof of concept testing of radiofrequency planar microcoils on commercial afm cantilevers the sensitive region of the coil was estimated to cover an approximate volume of 19 4 10 3 lm3 19 4 pl  functionality of the spectroscopic module of the prototype device is illustrated through the detection of 1h resonance in deionized water  the acquired spectra 14 depict combined nmr capability with afm that may ultimately enable biophysical and biochemical studies at the single cell level  vc 2013 aip publishing llc http dx doi org 10 1063 1 4801318 '

aS' new interactive system detects touch and gestures on any surface this composite image shows how fingers and hands are computed in a new touch activated system that projects onto walls and other surfaces and allows people to interact with their environment and each other   purdue university image download photo west lafayette ind people can let their fingers and hands do the talking with a new touch activated system that projects onto walls and other surfaces and allows users to interact with their environment and each other  the system identifies the fingers of a person s hand while touching any plain surface it also recognizes hand posture and gestures revealing individual users by their unique traits   imagine having giant ipads everywhere on any wall in your house or office every kitchen counter without using expensive technology said niklas elmqvist an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at purdue university you can use any surface even a dumb physical surface like wood  you don t need to install expensive led displays and touch sensitive screens the new extended multitouch system allows more than one person to use a surface at the same time and also enables people to use both hands distinguishing between the right and left hand  research indicates the system is 98 percent accurate in determining hand posture which is critical to recognizing gestures and carrying out commands  the technology has many possible applications said karthik ramani purdue s donald w feddersen professor of mechanical engineering   basically it might be used for any interior surface to interact virtually with a computer he said you could use it for living environments to turn appliances on in a design studio to work on a concept or in a laboratory where a student and instructor interact   findings are detailed in a research paper being presented this week during the association for computing machinery symposium on user interface software and technology acm uist 2012 in cambridge mass  the paper was written by doctoral students sundar murugappan and vinayak who uses only one name elmqvist and ramani we project a computer screen on any surface just a normal table covered with white paper ramani said   the camera sees where your hands are which fingers you are pressing on the surface tracks hand gestures and recognizes whether there is more than one person working at the same time   the kinect camera senses depth making it possible to see how far each 3 d pixel is from the camera the researchers married the camera with a new computer model for the hand   so we can isolate different parts of a hand or finger to show how far they are from the surface elmqvist said we can see which fingers are touching the surface  with this technology you could potentially call up a menu by positioning your hand just above the surface that camera coupled with the hand model allows the system to locate the center of each hand which is necessary for determining gestures and distinguishing between left and right hands  researchers explored possible applications including one that allows the user to draw a sketch with a pen and then modify it with their hands   we can detect gestural interactions between more than one hand and more than one user ramani said you could do precision things like writing with a pen with your dominant hand and more general things such as selecting colors using the non dominant hand   researchers tested the concept in two user studies one with 14 volunteers and the other with nine findings from one study indicated display features should be no smaller than 18 millimeters or about an inch to be efficient   while new and more precise cameras will improve accuracy we have established the necessary hand models and principles for the system ramani said  the other user study showed the system can effectively determine hand posture and whether the right or left hand is being used   we wanted to see how accurate we could be while figuring out different configurations such as touching with all 10 fingers which hand is being used and so on elmqvist said  the research has been supported by the national science foundation and the donald w feddersen chaired professorship at purdue school of mechanical engineering  multitouch surfaces are becoming prevalent but most existing technologies are only capable of detecting the user s actual points of contact on the surface and not the identity posture and handedness of the user  in this paper we define the concept of extended multitouch interaction as a richer input modality that includes all of this information  we further present a practical solution to achieve this on tabletop displays based on mounting a single commodity depth camera above a horizontal surface  this will enable us to not only detect when the surface is being touched but also recover the user s exact finger and hand posture as well as distinguish between different users and their handedness  we validate our approach using two user studies and deploy the technique in a scratchpad tool and in a pen touch sketch tool  '

aS' new modeling approach transforms imaging technologies researchers are improving the performance of technologies ranging from medical ct scanners to digital cameras using a system of models to extract specific information from huge collections of data and then reconstructing images like a jigsaw puzzle  here the method is used to create a high resolution 3 d electron microscopy reconstruction of aluminum nanoparticles aiding efforts to design nanocomposites for applications ranging from fuel cells to transparent coatings   purdue university u s air force research laboratory and carnegie mellon university download photo west lafayette ind researchers are improving the performance of technologies ranging from medical ct scanners to digital cameras using a system of models to extract specific information from huge collections of data and then reconstructing images like a jigsaw puzzle   it s more or less how humans solve problems by trial and error assessing probability and discarding extraneous information said charles bouman purdue university s michael and katherine birck professor of electrical and computer engineering and a professor of biomedical engineering  mbir has been used in a new ct scanning technology that exposes patients to one fourth the radiation of conventional ct scanners  in consumer electronics a new camera has been introduced that allows the user to focus the picture after it has been taken these innovations are the result of 20 years of research globally to develop iterative reconstruction bouman said   we are just scratching the surface as the research community builds more accurate models we can extract more information to get better results   in medical ct scanners the reduction of radiation exposure is due to increased efficiency achieved via the models and algorithms  mbir reduces noise in the data providing greater clarity that allows the radiologist or radiological technician to scan the patient at a lower dosage bouman said   it s like having night vision goggles he said they enable you to see in very low light just as mbir allows you to take high quality ct scans with a low power x ray source   researchers also have used the approach to improve the quality of images taken with an electron microscope new findings are detailed in a research paper being presented during the electronic imaging 2013 conference in san francisco this week traditionally imaging sensors and software are designed to detect and measure a particular property  the new approach does the inverse collecting huge quantities of data and later culling specific information from this pool of information using specialized models and algorithms   we abandon the idea of purity collecting precisely what we need bouman said instead let s take all the measurements we possibly can and then later extract what we want  this increases the envelope of what you can do enormously purdue the university of notre dame and ge healthcare used mbir to create veo a new ct scanning technology that enables physicians to diagnose patients with high clarity images at previously unattainable low radiation dose levels  the technology has been shown to reduce radiation exposure by 78 percent if you can get diagnostically usable scans at such low dosages this opens up the potential to do large scale screening for things like lung cancer bouman said   you open up entirely new clinical applications because the dosage is so low a ct scanner is far better at diagnosing disease than planar x rays because it provides a three dimensional picture of the tissue  however conventional ct scanners emit too much radiation to merit wider diagnostic use but as the dosage goes down the risk benefit tradeoff for screening will become much more favorable bouman said   for electron microscopy the principle advantage is higher resolutions but there is also some advantage in reduction of electron dosage which can damage the sample   the research to develop veo has been a team effort with ken sauer an associate professor of electrical engineering at notre dame in collaboration with jean baptiste thibault jiang hsieh and zhou yu  thibault and yu worked on the technology as graduate assistants under bouman and sauer and both currently work for ge healthcare   and there are lots of other people doing similar and related research at other universities and research labs around the world bouman said   ultimately 3 d x ray ct images might require little more dosage than old fashion planar chest x rays this would allow ct to be used for medical screening without significant adverse effects   in the electron microscope research mbir was used to take images of tiny beads called aluminum nanoparticles we are getting reconstruction quality that s dramatically better than was possible before and we think we can improve it even further bouman said  improved resolution could help researchers design the next generation of nanocomposites for applications such as fuel cells and transparent coatings  the paper was authored by purdue doctoral student singanallur venkatakrishnan u s air force research laboratory researchers lawrence drummy and jeff simmons michael jackson a researcher from bluequartz software carnegie mellon university researcher marc de graef and bouman  a tutorial article pdf also appeared in january in the journal current radiological reports the models and algorithms in mbir apply probability computations to extract the correct information much as people use logical assumptions to draw conclusions   you search all possible data to find what you are looking for bouman said this is how people solve problems you saw bob yesterday at the store you wonder where he was coming from  well you determine that he was probably coming from work because you have some probabilistic models in your mind you know he probably wasn t coming from san francisco because bob doesn t go to san francisco very often etc   mbir also could bring more affordable ct scanners for airport screening in conventional scanners an x ray source rotates at high speed around a chamber capturing cross section images of luggage placed inside the chamber  however mbir could enable the machines to be simplified by eliminating the need for the rotating mechanism future research includes work to use iterative reconstruction to study materials  purdue is part of a new multi university research initiative funded by the u s air force and led by de graef researchers will use the method to study the structure of materials work that could lead to development of next generation materials  note to journalists an electronic copy of the spie research paper is available from emil venere purdue news

been widely used in the life sciences to characterize biological specimens in 3 d  while bf et is the dominant modality in the life sciences it has been generally avoided in the physical sciences due to anomalous measurements in the data due to a phenomenon called bragg scatter visible when crystalline samples are imaged  these measurements cause undesirable artifacts in the reconstruction when the typical algorithms such as filtered back projection fbp and simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt are applied to the data  model based iterative reconstruction mbir provides a powerful framework for tomographic reconstruction that incorporates a model for data acquisition noise in the measurement and a model for the object to obtain reconstructions that are qualitatively superior and quantitatively accurate  in this paper we present a novel mbir algorithm for bf et which accounts for the presence of anomalous measurements from bragg scatter in the data during the iterative reconstruction  our method accounts for the anomalies by formulating the reconstruction as minimizing a cost function which rejects measurements that deviate significantly from the typical beer s law model widely assumed for bf et  results on simulated as well as real data show that our method can dramatically improve the reconstructions compared to fbp and mbir without anomaly rejection suppressing the artifacts due to the bragg anomalies  '

aS' new steering tech for heavy equipment saves fuel ups efficiency purdue university professor monika ivantysynova and doctoral student naseem daher discuss research related to a new hydraulic steering technology while graduate student michael sprengel looks over the electronic controls of a front loader  researchers led by ivantysynova the maha fluid power systems professor have shown how to reduce fuel consumption while dramatically improving the efficiency of hydraulic steering systems in heavy construction equipment   purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind researchers at purdue university have shown how to reduce fuel consumption while improving the efficiency of hydraulic steering systems in heavy construction equipment  the new approach incorporates several innovations it eliminates valves now needed to direct the flow of hydraulic fluid in steering systems and uses advanced algorithms and models to precisely control hydraulic pumps  new designs might also incorporate textured microstructured surfaces inside pumps to improve performance fuel consumption of heavy off road equipment accounts for a significant portion of total global fuel usage so improving efficiency is very important said monika ivantysynova maha fluid power systems professor in purdue s school of mechanical engineering it s also important from a commercial business point of view because money saved on fuel improves a company s bottom line   typical hydraulic systems in heavy equipment use a central variable displacement pump that delivers fluid and valves that throttle the flow of fluid to linear and rotary actuators that move tools such as shovels buckets and steering mechanisms  this throttling causes energy to be dissipated as heat and wasted in the new valveless design each actuator has its own pump eliminating the need for valves  the actuator motion can be precisely controlled by adjusting the pump displacement which changes the amount of fluid being delivered to the actuator  being able to adjust the pump displacement makes it possible to run the machinery s diesel engine at optimal speeds resulting in additional fuel savings  findings are detailed in a research paper being presented during the sae 2013 commercial vehicle engineering congress on oct 1 3 in rosemont ill  the paper was authored by doctoral student naseem daher and ivantysynova director of purdue s maha fluid power research center  present hydrostatic steering systems are plagued by poor energy efficiency and industry is developing new steer by wire technologies to reduce fuel consumption and improve performance  however the steer by wire systems being developed still require energy wasting valves testing the new electro hydraulic power steering system on a front loader has shown a 15 percent fuel savings and 23 percent increased machine productivity for a total fuel efficiency increase of 43 percent during steering maneuvers   the world s first pump controlled steer by wire prototype machine is now readily available for further research and development said ivantysynova who has a dual appointment in the department of agricultural and biological engineering  in previous projects maha researchers have shown that valveless systems could reduce fuel consumption by 40 percent in an excavator equipped with the technology  measurements on the same excavator prototype also showed 70 percent productivity improvement in terms of tons of soil removed per kilogram of fuel consumed  the new steering system also may help reduce operator fatigue while improving safety by controlling the level of steering wheel torque feedback   steer by wire technology removes all torque the twisting force required to turn the steering wheel however removing the torque is potentially dangerous because the driver lacks the tactile feedback needed to properly control the vehicle  in the new system torque feedback is regulated according to parameters such as steering wheel angle and turning speed vehicle speed and the angle of a rotating joint that connects the vehicle s two subframes  new thermodynamic modeling by the group also has found that steel parts in the pump undergo significant deformations from high heat during operation   the deformation due to heat can be as large as the thickness of the lubricating film and this is very important she said we have developed the only code that models these lubricating interfaces under extreme heat and high pressure   the research paper includes details of the system s layout the hardware and electronic controller developed through the use of modeling  the researchers developed and used the modeling to simulate the system s performance the purdue laboratory is working with industry partners on applied research projects said anthony franklin the maha lab s manager   our prototypes are very close to commercial prototypes so they are readily adaptable to machines now in use and can be easily industrialized when manufacturers decide to make the transition into valveless systems he said the maha fluid power research center is part of the engineering research center for compact and efficient fluid power funded by the national science foundation participating companies and universities  modern on road vehicles have been making steady strides when it comes to employing technological advances featuring active safety systems  however off highway machines are lagging in this area and are in dire need for modernization one chassis system that has been receiving much attention in the automotive field is the steering system where several electric and electrohydraulic steering architectures have been implemented and steer by wire technologies are under current research and development activities  on the other hand off highway articulated steering vehicles have not adequately evolved to meet the needs of original equipment manufacturers oem as well as their end customers  present day hydrostatic steering systems are plagued with poor energy efficiency due to valve throttling losses and are considered passive systems relative to safety adjustability and comfort  his paper introduces a novel scheme of an electro hydraulic power steering system that utilizes a proven energy saving technology pump displacement control which eliminates throttling losses associated with hydraulic control valves by controlling the displacement of a variable displacement pump  this new architecture lends itself to high energy efficiency resulting in lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions higher machine productivity and reduced operator fatigue and active safety functions that counteract instabilities and reject disturbances  '

aS' nigerian company licenses purdue crop storage system that deters insects the purdue improved crop storage is a three bag non chemical hermetic storage system that limits the reproductive capacity of cowpea weevils that consumes grain after harvest  the system was developed by purdue entomologist larry murdock and has been licensed to kano nigeria based lela agro industries nigeria ltd   purdue university agricultural communications photo download photo west lafayette ind and kano nigeria farmers in west and central african nations could benefit economically socially and nutritionally using a crop storage system developed by researchers at purdue university and licensed to kano based lela agro industries nigeria ltd  the purdue improved crop storage pics system was developed by larry l murdock professor of entomology in the purdue college of agriculture  and scientists in cameroon the research was funded by a usaid program and supported by purdue s international programs in agriculture  murdock said pics originally was developed to store cowpeas or black eyed peas which are eaten in storage by cowpea weevils an invasive insect  the system reduces the amount of damage the weevils inflict upon stored cowpeas cowpea weevils have an amazing reproductive capacity and can destroy any store of grain many times over in less than a year  a single female cowpea weevil can produce 60 male and female offspring in one month or less in another month there are 1 800 cowpea weevils and 54 000 the month after that he said   the numbers keep rising until everything edible is rendered worthless murdock said the system uses hermetically sealed bags which means they have the quality of being airtight   the pics bags are uninhabitable environments for cowpea weevils he said the keys to the success of pics are that insect reproduction is essentially stopped quickly and most eventually die of dehydration   james jess m lowenberg deboer associate dean in the college of agriculture and director of international programs in agriculture  said pics has been used throughout the world with around 2 5 million bags being sold to date from left managing director kabir jibrin

from the usaid office in kigali as well as afghanistan burundi ethiopia india kenya laos malawi tanzania uganda zambia and zimbabwe   sani moussa who grows cowpeas in the maradi region of niger has used pics since 2010 before then weevils destroyed the crops he stored   i remember storing three sacks of cowpeas and after four months in storage there was nothing left he said because i could not store grains for a long time i had to sell them when prices were low  consequently the production could not cover daily needs including socio economic needs such as marriages and naming ceremonies   with the arrival of the pics bags my storage increased three times that i had before because i had no fear of losses due to insect damage he said   i can now wait to sell until the period when cowpea prices are high and increase my profits moussa maman who also grows cowpeas in the maradi region has used pics since 2009  before then he lost more than 50 percent of his grain in storage due to cowpea weevils as a result he had to sell his harvest when prices were low   now that i use pics i can store two or three times the quantity that i could store before my income also has increased two or three times he said   one no longer has any worries about storing food people gain a benefit from their production he said hassan fawaz managing director at lela agro said the company will manufacture more than one million pics bags in 2013 selling most in nigeria but exporting around 100 000 to neighboring countries  the company plans to expand production to more than 1 5 million bags in 2014 pics bags are more effective than other bags because they are made of 80 micron thick high density materials  they are more cost effective hermetic containers for most uses than metal drums or plastic jugs he said pics bags are easy to use which makes them an improvement upon storage insecticides which could be misused to harmful effect   lela agro also has licensed the trademarked pics logo other companies have manufactured counterfeit bags they claim are pics and have the same characteristics  these manufacturers will not have access to the pics logo which means farmers will be able to differentiate between them tests have been conducted the last two years to determine if pics is effective in stopping storage insects that attack other grains like corn wheat rice soybeans sorghum millet chickpeas and hibiscus seed  this work is being done under the pics2 grant funded by the bill melinda gates foundation we believe pics will effectively control most insect pests of many

aS'  no sleep energy bugs drain smartphone batteries west lafayette ind researchers have proposed a method to automatically detect a new class of software glitches in smartphones called no sleep energy bugs which can entirely drain batteries while the phones are not in use   these energy bugs are a silent battery killer said y charlie hu a purdue university professor of electrical and computer engineering   a fully charged phone battery can be drained in as little as five hours because conserving battery power is critical for smartphones the industry has adopted an aggressive sleep policy he said   what this means is that smartphones are always in a sleep mode by default when there are no active user interactions such as screen touches every component including the central processor stays off unless an app instructs the operating system to keep it on   for example a mailer may need to automatically update email by checking with the remote server hu said to prevent the phone from going to sleep during such operations smartphone manufacturers make application programming interfaces or apis available to app developers  the developers insert the apis into apps to instruct the phone to stay awake long enough to perform necessary operations app developers have to explicitly juggle different power control apis that are exported from the operating systems of the smartphones hu said   unfortunately programmers are only human they make mistakes when using these apis which leads to software bugs that mishandle power control preventing the phone from engaging the sleep mode  as a result the phone stays awake and drains the battery findings are detailed in a research paper being presented during the 10th international conference on mobile systems applications and services or mobisys 2012 june 25 29 in the united kingdom the paper was written by doctoral students abhinav pathak and abhilash jindal hu and samuel midkiff a purdue professor of electrical and computer engineering  the researchers have completed the first systematic study of the no sleep bugs and have proposed a method for automatically detecting them   we ve had anecdotal evidence concerning these no sleep energy bugs but there has not been any systematic study of them until now midkiff said  the researchers studied 187 android applications that were found to contain android s explicit power control apis called wakelocks   of the 187 apps 42 were found to contain errors or bugs in their wakelock code findings showed the new tool accurately detected all 12 previously known instances of no sleep energy bugs and found 30 new bugs in the apps  the glitch has been found in interactive apps such as phone applications and services for telephony on android that must work even though the user isn t touching the phone  the app may fail to engage the sleep mode after the interactive session is completed you don t see any difference hu said you put it in your pocket and you

aS' nuclear weapon simulations show performance in molecular detail employees at lawrence livermore national laboratory work on a high performance computer purdue researchers have collaborated with the national laboratory using a similar high performance computer to improve simulations that show a nuclear weapon s performance in precise molecular detail   photo courtesy of lawrence livermore national laboratory download photo west lafayette ind u s researchers are perfecting simulations that show a nuclear weapon s performance in precise molecular detail tools that are becoming critical for national defense because international treaties forbid the detonation of nuclear test weapons  the simulations must be operated on supercomputers containing thousands of processors but doing so has posed reliability and accuracy problems said saurabh bagchi an associate professor in purdue university s school of electrical and computer engineering now researchers at purdue and high performance computing experts at the national nuclear security administration s nnsa lawrence livermore national laboratory have solved several problems hindering the use of the ultra precise simulations  nnsa is the quasi independent agency within the u s department of energy that oversees the nation s nuclear security activities  the simulations which are needed to more efficiently certify nuclear weapons may require 100 000 machines a level of complexity that is essential to accurately show molecular scale reactions taking place over milliseconds or thousandths of a second  the same types of simulations also could be used in areas such as climate modeling and studying the dynamic changes in a protein s shape  such highly complex jobs must be split into many processes that execute in parallel on separate machines in large computer clusters bagchi said   due to natural faults in the execution environment there is a high likelihood that some processing element will have an error during the application s execution resulting in corrupted memory or failed communication between machines bagchi said   there are bottlenecks in terms of communication and computation these errors are compounded as long as the simulation continues to run before the glitch is detected and may cause simulations to stall or crash altogether   we are particularly concerned with errors that corrupt data silently possibly generating incorrect results with no indication that the error has occurred said bronis r  de supinski co leader of the asc application development environment performance team at lawrence livermore errors that significantly reduce system performance are also a major concern since the systems on which the simulations run are very expensive   advanced simulation and computing is the computational arm of nnsa s stockpile stewardship program which ensures the safety security and reliability of the nation s nuclear deterrent without underground testing  new findings will be detailed in a paper to be presented during the annual ieee ifip international conference on dependable systems and networks from june 25 28 in boston  recent research findings were detailed in two papers last year one presented during the ieee supercomputing conference and the other during the international symposium on high performance parallel and distributed computing   you want the system to automatically pinpoint when and in what machine the error took place and also the part of the code that was involved bagchi said   then a developer can come in look at it and fix the problem streaming data to a central server works fine for a hundred machines but it can t keep up when you are streaming data from a thousand machines said purdue doctoral student ignacio laguna who worked with lawrence livermore computer scientists   we ve eliminated this central brain so we no longer have that bottleneck each machine in the supercomputer cluster contains several cores or processors and each core might run one process during simulations  the researchers created an automated method for clustering or grouping the large number of processes into a smaller number of equivalence classes with similar traits  grouping the processes into equivalence classes makes it possible to quickly detect and pinpoint problems the recent breakthrough was to be able to scale up the clustering so that it works with a large supercomputer bagchi said  lawrence livermore computer scientist todd gamblin came up with the scalable clustering approach a lingering bottleneck in using the simulations is related to a procedure called checkpointing or periodically storing data to prevent its loss in case a machine or application crashes  the information is saved in a file called a checkpoint and stored in a parallel system distant from the machines on which the application runs   the problem is that when you scale up to 10 000 machines this parallel file system bogs down bagchi said it s about 10 times too much activity for the system to handle and this mismatch will just become worse because we are continuing to create faster and faster computers   doctoral student tanzima zerin and rudolf eigenmann a professor of electrical and computer engineering along with bagchi led work to develop a method for compressing the checkpoints similar to the compression of data for images   we re beginning to solve the checkpointing problem bagchi said it s not completely solved but we are getting there the checkpointing bottleneck must be solved in order for researchers to create supercomputers capable of exascale computing or 1 000 quadrillion operations per second  the research has been funded by lawrence livermore and the national science foundation the work also involves lawrence livermore scientists greg bronevetsky dong h  ahn martin schulz and ibm austin researcher mootaz elnozahy laguna was awarded a george michael memorial high performance

library or from the research group s home page at https engineering purdue edu dcsl purdue researchers did not work with the actual classified nuclear weapons software code but instead used generic benchmarks a set of programs designed to help evaluate the performance of parallel supercomputers  donald b johnston senior editor press officer lawrence livermore national laboratory 925 423 4902 johnston19 llnl gov enterprise and high performance computing systems are growing extremely large and complex employing many processors and diverse software hardware stacks 1  as these machines grow in scale faults become more frequent and system complexity makes it difficult to detect and diagnose them  the difficulty is particularly large for faults that degrade system performance or cause erratic behavior but do not cause outright crashes  the cost of these errors is high since they significantly reduce system productivity both initially and by time required to resolve them  current system management techniques 2 3 do not work well since they require manual examination of system behavior and do not identify root causes  when a fault is manifested system administrators need timely notification about the type of fault the time period in which it occurred and the processor on which it originated  statistical modeling approaches can accurately characterize normal and abnormal system behavior 4 however the complex effects of system faults are less amenable to these techniques  this paper demonstrates that the complexity of system faults makes traditional classification and clustering algorithms inadequate for characterizing them  we design novel techniques that combine classification algorithms with information on the abnormality of application behavior to improve detection and characterization accuracy significantly  our experiments demonstrate that our techniques can detect and characterize faults with 85 accuracy compared to just 12 accuracy for direct applications of traditional techniques  '

diet beverages may not be the healthy choice to manage weight that they appear  swithers reviewed and evaluated the most recent research on whether consuming high intensity sweeteners despite having zero or low calories may result in overeating weight gain or other health problems  her findings were published in trends in endocrinology metabolism purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind   diet beverages and other non caloric artificially sweetened foods and drinks may not be the healthy choice to manage weight that they appear according to a purdue university expert s review of recent scientific studies   public health officials are rightfully concerned about the consequences of consuming sugar sweetened beverages such as soft drinks but these warnings may need to be expanded to advocate limiting the intake of all sweeteners including no calorie sweeteners and so called diet soft drinks said susan e  swithers a professor of psychological sciences and a behavioral neuroscientist although it seems like common sense that diet sodas would not be problematic that doesn t appear to be the case  findings from a variety of studies show that routine consumption of diet sodas even one per day can be connected to higher likelihood of heart disease stroke diabetes metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure in addition to contributing to weight gain   swithers who studies ingestive behavior and body weight specifically the roles that artificial sweeteners and other food substitutes play in weight management and eating reviewed and evaluated the most recent research on whether consuming high intensity sweeteners despite their zero or low calories may result in overeating weight gain or other health problems  her findings were published by cell press on wednesday july 10 in an opinion article in trends in endocrinology metabolism  the concerns for these chemical sweeteners emerged across studies that varied widely in design methodology and population demographics and they applied to sweeteners such as aspartame sucralose and saccharin  about 30 percent of adults and 15 percent of children in the united states consume artificial sweeteners the concern that these non caloric sweeteners might not be healthy is a message that many people do not want to hear especially as the prevalence of artificial sweeteners increases in other products swithers said   there is a lot of pressure from the public health sector to find solutions to counter the rise of obesity and chronic disease and there is a lot of money and business at stake for the food industry as it develops and promotes these products  beverages are becoming political issues as government leaders and politicians seek regulation and taxing to limit their availability and consumption but most of these measures exclude diet soft drinks because they are perceived as healthy  when it comes to making policy decisions it s more important than ever that the science is considered and that the public understands what the science says in order to help them make the best health decisions   swithers who also is a member of purdue s ingestive behavior research center looked at a variety of studies including the san antonio heart study that reported an increase in body weight gain for adults and adolescents who consumed artificially sweetened beverages over beverages regularly sweetened  data from a number of studies including the nurses health study and the health professionals follow up study also reported greater risk of type 2 diabetes high blood pressure heart disease and metabolic syndrome which is related to diabetes and cardiovascular problems for consumers of artificially sweetened beverages  some data indicated that those who consumed artificially sweetened beverages had double the risk of metabolic syndrome compared to non consumers  research also shows that non caloric or reduced calorie food and beverages interfere with a body s learned responses the assumption is that fewer calories means less weight gain  research including studies from swithers and colleagues shows that frequent consumption of high intensity sweeteners may have the opposite effect by confusing the body s natural ability to manage calories based on tasting something sweet  swithers research is funded by the national institutes of health and she is continuing to study these effects expanding studies from animal models to humans is one of the challenges for swithers and other researchers trying to answer questions about how diet drinks affect humans  the studies that show specific mechanisms and metabolic causes are from animal models in human studies researchers can only see correlations and not identify specific causes  swithers said it also is challenging to do well designed studies in humans because of how ubiquitous sweeteners have become in the mainstream diet   for example what are the biological mechanisms and behavioral factors that influence this connection between diet soda and diabetes   swithers said some of the connection could be related to how people behave by saying to themselves i m having a diet soda so this cheeseburger is ok   but the animal work indicates that health problems can occur even without this kind of thinking since we don t fully understand the mechanisms we don t really know how to reverse the consequences and that will continue to be a problem as our population ages and the rates of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes continue to increase   note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the journal article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service at 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu as the negative impact of consuming sugar sweetened beverages on weight and other health outcomes has been increasingly recognized many people have turned to high intensity sweeteners like aspartame sucralose and saccharin as way to reduce risk of these consequences  however accumulating evidence suggests that frequent consumers of these sugar substitutes may also be at increased risk for excessive weight gain metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes t2d and cardiovascular disease  this paper reviews these findings and considers the hypothesis that consuming sweet tasting but non caloric or reduced calorie food and beverages interferes with learned responses that normally contribute to glucose and energy homeostasis  because of this interference frequent consumption of high intensity sweeteners may have the counterintuitive effect of inducing

aS' prof how to help children cope with tornado season fears west lafayette ind the tornado that hit the oklahoma city area on monday may 20 may be especially frightening for children because of the destruction to schools and the number of children who died says a purdue university child development expert   children should be reassured that this was a very unusual storm and adults can tell them that most won t be like this and we as a family or class will do everything we can to stay safe and be there for each other says judith myers walls professor emeritus of child development   children are limited in their ability to understand causality and probability so it s likely their fears will be raised by news stories of this event   remind children about the adults in their lives who are there to take care of them and keep them safe fear comes from feeling out of control so children can feel empowered when they learn safety procedures  but also keep in mind that some procedures can make children anxious if they feel they don t have the resources to complete them  for example children who don t have a basement to take shelter in may be especially worried so review the family plan so they are aware of alternate safe home shelter locations   to help younger children not be so fearful following a tornado siren drill or warning have a special activity that is just for the safe area such as a board game   try your best to normalize tornado warnings and it will help younger children not to panic when it is necessary to move to the shelter either as practice or in a real emergency myers walls says   but parents know their child best and while some may need to be reassured others will need to be reminded of the potential danger and to take the warnings seriously   children who are especially concerned about what happened in oklahoma can be encouraged to help the community by running a lemonade stand to raise money for the red cross or visiting the local emergency response organization to see how it helps people myers walls says  children also can deal with fears by expressing themselves through telling stories or drawing pictures '

aS' prof nation s first military park celebrates battle s 150th anniversary west lafayette ind there are dozens of civil war battle anniversaries being recognized during the war s 150th anniversary but one that stands out is chickamauga because it s the nation s first military park says a purdue university historian   prior to the creation of the military park at chickamauga private groups corporations and donors were the force behind memorials and monuments says caroline e  janney an associate professor of history her research focuses on memory and the civil war these private interests especially in the civil war s aftermath were not always moving the nation forward with reunion and reconciliation   for example gettysburg national military park which is the most popular civil war battlefield was created first and foremost as a union memorial field janney says  plans for other national government military parks including antietam shiloh and gettysburg followed the chickamauga chattanooga national military park announcement  plans to establish a national park at chickamauga began in 1897 during the silver anniversary by adding the nearby battle of chattanooga to the legislation promoters believed it would help the nation heal  it would honor both a union and confederate victory the plan for the park was approved in 1890 and the federal government dedicated it in 1895 32 years after the sept  19 1863 battle the chickamauga battle marked the union s most significant loss and one of the bloodiest of the war it was second only to gettysburg in casualties   the common saying is the winner writes history and the private interest groups and individual states were telling the story they wanted to tell through these memorials janney says   with national government oversight the memorial planners could promote reconciliation by ensuring that both sides were equally represented in the processions and dedication services and ultimately the memorial   but moving forward in harmony also meant ignoring the causes and consequences of the war newspaper reports from the 1895 dedication heralded cordial veterans on both sides but sectionalism was alive and well   janney s research on chickamauga and the differences between reunion and reconciliation is the focus of her recent book remembering the civil war reunion and the limits of reconciliation   janney also is the president elect for the society of civil war historians and author of burying the dead but not the past ladies memorial associations and the lost cause   college of liberal arts'

aS' prof put energy drinks to rest during summer s heat west lafayette ind people consuming energy drinks as a cool way to beat the summer heat need to be aware of serving sizes stimulant ingredients and possible medication interactions before increasing the amount they drink says a purdue university expert   beverage consumption is likely to increase during the hot weather and there are risks to drinking products with high levels of caffeine or dietary supplements that are stimulants especially when dehydration can be an issue said janet r  thorlton an assistant professor of nursing who studies dietary supplements in general people underestimate how much fluid loss they experience on a hot day and for those working in the heat energy drinks may not be the best option   take note of the ingredients for example taurine a common booster in energy drinks can potentiate the effects of caffeine   check with a pharmacist regarding possible interactions between prescription medicines and energy drink ingredients some asthma and attention deficit disorder medications contain stimulants which can enhance the effects of an energy drink  some unsafe adverse effects are agitation anxiety irregular heartbeat high blood pressure and insomnia there is a difference between sports drinks and energy drinks and while they may sit on store shelves side by side they are regulated differently thorlton says   there is more awareness in athletic communities and many coaches educate their players about the best way to hydrate during practices in hot weather  however there are a number of people working outside in construction and yard maintenance who may not have this information energy drinks also are growing in popularity for people in the service young parents and students   '

aS' professor boruch to graduates west lafayette ind first of course of course and most important of all cheers and cheers to you the graduates this is a thrilling day and completely yours  proof we re all dressed up in these grave and funny outfits to mark your success this occasion of great and happy change i should be wearing my janus mask too janus the ancient roman god of doorways whose double face looks one way into the future and another way to the past  he isn t confused or worried just curious and thoughtful you finish as you commence and this is the delicious moment of your passage  so allow yourself a little time travel soon this place will be that place back there and your visits here 10 20 30 years from now will startle you the hallways of the buildings you knew so well will seem narrow the ceilings lower the students unthinkably young everything so strange almost surreal  you will be moved by the grief in that and the wonder of ever having been so young yourself that your years here were the occasion of a transformation you weren t quite aware was even happening when you were in the sweet bewildering thick of it  and for those of you older who came to begin or continue your education in future visits this place will become the site of your daring and deliberation and the great breath of relief and triumph in earning this degree  how the past morphs into the years to come can be both lovely and unsettling along those lines are more immediate matters to consider  my one of a kind most wonderful dentist for instance bill risk purdue 1959 who has practiced many decades now in lafayette as did his father and uncle before him  i love our chats when i am trapped in his chair with a little paper bib clipped around my neck he s a superb conversationalist as wild as his name though i have to admit it s hard to get a word in edgewise when he s packed my mouth with cotton and a dental dam and i can only mumble enthusiastically in response  no matter dr risk is rich with stories and my favorite orbits around a little cardboard suitcase it seems that every summer as children he and his older brother were packed off from lafayette to the state of maine by train to spend several weeks at a camp owned by their uncle clarence  yet dr risk s story begins much earlier sight unseen in 1928 a naturalist was hired to work at the camp a 20 year old who would continue to come by train too summer after summer his eye and ear alert to the woods  the first time though uncle clarence was late in picking up his new staff member at the town depot arriving a few minutes after the train had come and gone  he looked around and spotted a young man sitting stiffly on a bench a small cardboard suitcase beside him but get this dr risk said to me that young man was   and here he paused leaning closer guess i raised my eyebrows making a choked muffled sound to mean how would i know come on dr  risk tell me already roger tory peterson he stage whispered very loud now i m a birder meaning i watch birds and am slowly learning their songs  and to a birder or to anyone even vaguely smitten with the natural world this guy roger tory peterson the writer of so many excellent guides to that world is legend hero a saint of sorts  he actually invented the modern go to of that genre and if you don t believe me dr risk continued practically singing now check your peterson guide  uncle clarence is there right on the dedication page going home i did i checked my old beloved bird books and he s right clarence allen is warmly thanked on that page edition after edition need i say that it delights me dr risk s joy in repeating this story but a poignant detail continues to haunt and begins to mean in larger ways and in that lies the lasting power and poetry of image that little cardboard suitcase which is pretty much all he had the young man waiting at that town s tiny depot on the verge of the remarkable fate that would befall him however long it would take my point on this weighty occasion of course and duh everyone starts somewhere  that little cardboard suitcase think of it as your education as the key thing to cherish or as we often say in our house the key to the treasure is the treasure  still you must be ready for surprise and here is where i welcome the 19th century british poet john keats to this party decent company for all of us  he died young at 25 ravaged by the scourge totally mystifying in his era tuberculosis though he d done a lot by then hiked england and scotland fell in love studied medicine for several years  it was terrible the training required of doctors to be in the early 1800s his assisting in surgeries before anesthesia or any way to disinfect wounds day after day his patients in agony crying out as he cut into skin and muscle vein and artery legs going dark with gangrene  the dissection lab in his medical school at london s guy s hospital closed down in summer given its unbearable stench but keats had options other gifts in his cardboard suitcase  one was his passion for literature and language which is to say his education both his formal schooling and what he read on his own allowed him in the parlance of our time and place a kind of second major   or just say his serious heart and bone chilling work as an apprentice physician deepened his thought and sense and shook him to the core which turned out to be absolutely crucial to his writing  a small riff from his ode to a nightingale proves that where the poet sets his dream of song and mirth his plea for a beaker full of the warm south against what clearly is drawn from his crushing experience of hospital life the weariness the fever and the fret here where men sit and hear each other groan note to self then and to all of you everything matters  get curious let things stick to you you never know where your life will lead to what discoveries of self and world thus the poems john keats left behind and his remarkable correspondence too  in one of those letters he found this key to the universe something he called negative capability a willful turn of mind he claimed shakespeare had that made a person capable of being in uncertainties mysteries doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason   to hover for a while amid seeming contradictions to live comfortably with chaos and conflict part wary of everything part considering all sides that s the trick perhaps to savor such troubling moments as fruitful a useful way to begin to understand what happens as the years mount up and weigh us down  william blake another english poet had a similar thought that s often quoted his without contraries there is no progression which takes us a little farther directly toward a goal i suppose into progression the next step  but it s keats who honors the beginner s mind a point of wonder and humility out of which genuine engagement grows keep alert to what s opposite and surprising  at the very least you will never be bored because here s the rewarding demanding part of this whole business of the future most education is self education  you re not done i m not done but that s good news it isn t simply the amassing of facts and figures it s a habit of thought and feeling and being of opening and questioning and including  and that s what purdue has offered you keep doing it give it time the growth of the imagination is a life long trust here s the truth imagination it s not artsy light or frivolous or mere frosting on the cake  though it must be at the heart of genius it s better than that it s bottom line deep down grubby day after day practical case in point i listened once as chicago artist susanna coffey described a taxi ride she took in that city  suddenly some crazy driver peeled out of an alley nearly colliding and ripping through her passenger door i said nearly the cabbie hit the brakes and swerved safely and all was well  and did he blurt out what most of us would have a loud geez and what a jerk no after a minute she heard him say quietly through clenched teeth  that guy has no imagination there it is then imagination as a key to empathy to seeing through to possibilities beyond conclusion to not cracking up your car i imagine and hope for you a few things other than your getting back in one piece today on your drive home  for one money must be made necessary now and probably forever but when you love what you do and believe in something larger than your own gain you actually forget about that  do you know what that s called freedom as for the computer the tv beware but you already get that right how they can lobotomize you how the cheapest elements of our culture can flash from those screens  we re all susceptible believe me just be braver than your handheld turn it off and talk to people face to face and in the years to come there s always john keats to channel on occasion or a lot his holding back at first his light touch welcoming doubt and mystery and uncertainty to help you figure your way through the world  part of that means continuing to read good stuff widely and with hunger beyond your usual interests and take on things the great subjects of poetry are pretty simple death love time knowledge beauty  they don t need much help coming down to us playing out in the familiar the sweet ordinary think about route 65 or 231 say driving through indiana passing the vast realms of soybeans and corn distant houses small towns whose names on signs puzzle or charm  and the hay you see bundled up after harvest huge rolls of it scattered in the fields i love the poet jane kenyon s lines about that   i wish you would look at the hay she wrote the beautiful sane and solid bales of hay note that rare and sacred word sane  take that with you in your cardboard suitcase we ll all be under the sod in a hundred years relish your life so what if most of our days turn in their familiar orbit of wake and work and sleep our habits all the little compelling weirdnesses that absorb us  that s solace and good grounding but there s also the sight of earth from afar from the astronaut s cockpit window your mission should you choose to accept it is to make peace and honest trouble between those separate worlds until what is small looms large and what is large opens to us eye level fully human  '

aS' project aims to mass produce nanopetals for sensors batteries these color enhanced scanning electron microscope images show nanosheets resembling tiny rose petals the nanosheets are key components of a new type of biosensor that can detect minute concentrations of glucose in saliva tears and urine  the technology might eventually help to eliminate or reduce the frequency of using pinpricks for diabetes testing purdue university photo jeff goecker  download photo west lafayette ind researchers at purdue university are developing a method to mass produce a new type of nanomaterial for advanced sensors and batteries with an eye toward manufacturing in the midwest  research findings indicate the material shows promise as a sensor for detecting glucose in the saliva or tears and for supercapacitors that could make possible fast charging high performance batteries  however for the material to be commercialized researchers must find a way to mass produce it at low cost it s one thing to say you ve got a new wonder material but can you prove that it can be made on a commercial scale   said arvind raman robert v adams professor of mechanical engineering in many cases we find that fundamental research needs to be done for scaling up  you want to be able to produce large quantities of the material at 50 cents per square meter now a team of purdue researchers will aim to do just that  the project funded with a 1 5 million grant from the national science foundation focuses on creating a nanomanufacturing method that is scalable or capable of mass production at low cost  the underlying technology was developed by a research group led by timothy fisher the james g dwyer professor in mechanical engineering  it consists of vertical nanostructures resembling tiny rose petals made of a material called graphene which is a single atom thick film of carbon   using these graphene nanopetals we have realized exceptional performance in a wide range of devices at laboratory scales fisher said  the researchers hope to boost the production speed of nanopetal coated surfaces to 10 square meters per hour representing a dramatic increase over the laboratory scale production rate  raman has expertise in roll to roll manufacturing a mainstay of many industrial operations including paper and sheet metal production  he models the mechanics of the process of creating flexible materials in sheets at high speed and under tension a key factor is going to be industry partners he said   there are many industries that have roll to roll operations so focusing on roll to roll as a platform for doing nanomaterials production is very strategic for the midwest   you have to be able to measure the material while it is being manufactured and this is a challenge because of the nanometer scale of the petals he said  the graphene nanopetals also have shown promise as a thermal interface material to keep computer chips from overheating a slew of new device and material concepts based on graphene nanopetals are emerging in applications as diverse as carbon fiber composites and new thermal interface materials raman said   commercial interest is extremely high for this recent carbon nanomaterial other key researchers in the project are alina alexeenko an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics alexander wei a professor in the department of chemistry ernesto e  marinero a professor of engineering practice in the schools of chemical engineering and materials engineering and euiwon bae a research professor of mechanical engineering  the nanopetals are created in a vacuum by exposing a cloth of carbon fiber to high energy plasma that contains hydrogen ions and other ingredients a process known as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition  alexeenko will lead work to model the plasma reactor and to optimize its conditions for fast and environmentally friendly conversion of raw materials such as methane and hydrogen into carbon nanopetals  wei will functionalize petals with metal nanoparticles and enzymes that recognize glucose or other target molecules for biosensing  marinero will focus on reliability of devices made using the nanomaterial and bae will work to ensure proper petal size by analyzing patterns of light scattering from the material s surface  most of the research will be based at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park scale up production is a key challenge facing nanotechnology said ali shakouri the mary jo and robert l  kirk director of the birck nanotechnology center and a professor of electrical and computer engineering this nsf project is part of a broader nanomanufacturing initiative at the birck nanotechnology center where we focus on roll to roll production of smart thin films for applications in pharmacy and food packaging   wei said the project represents the front edge of a much larger movement at purdue to synergize core research expertise in science and engineering in a way that provides graduate students with opportunities to overcome the challenges of converting exciting research discoveries into products that can be commercialized   technologies developed in the project might be commercialized through collaboration with a local start up company folium nanotechnologies llc co founded by fisher and marinero as well as roche diagnostics and the battery innovation center  the center was launched this year to leverage indiana s public and private sector assets in advanced battery technologies to facilitate research and development rapid prototyping and contract manufacturing for industry academic and military customers   a regional workshop series on roll to roll nanomanufacturing will be organized to serve as a catalyst to innovation in the midwest by bringing together interested small medium and large enterprises together with original equipment manufacturers and university researchers raman said  the researchers also will make available advanced simulation tools for vacuum based roll to roll processes the tools will be available to companies through the cyberinfrastructure of the manufacturing hub and nanohub an interactive website that makes available scientific simulations seminars interactive courses and other specialized nanotech related materials   we will educate the u s workforce through an innovative online class on nanomanufacturing offered as part of the nanohub u initative raman said   many results from this research are not just applicable to graphene nanopetal technology but rather to a wide variety of nanomaterials manufactured in low pressure and ambient roll to roll nanomanufacturing processes he said  ali shakouri 765 496 6105 shakouri purdue edu'

aS' purdue builds nation s fastest campus supercomputer again west lafayette ind for the third year in a row purdue university has confirmed its lead in the rarified realm of supercomputing by unveiling conte the nation s fastest university owned supercomputer developed in a collaboration with hp intel and mellanox  conte is the highest ranking campus supercomputer on the june 2013 top500 org list of international supercomputers purdue s latest supercomputer surpasses the nation s previous fastest university owned leading machine carter which was built in 2011 and is still in operation at purdue   we don t do this only to be at the top of a list although it s nice to have an external measure of our success in delivering the most effective computational tools to our researchers says gerry mccartney vice president for information technology cio and oesterle professor of it   the reason we do this is because our faculty have a constantly growing need for more and faster computational resources conte clocked in with a sustained measured maximum speed of 943 38 teraflops and a peak performance of 1 342 petaflops  to give an idea of how fast that is conte would process a problem 15 000 times faster than a 15 inch apple macbook pro a high end consumer laptop  conte was built with 580 hp proliant sl250 generation 8 gen8 servers each incorporating two intel xeon processors and two intel xeon phi coprocessors integrated with mellanox 56gb s fdr infiniband  purdue names each of its supercomputers after a faculty member staff member or alumnus who made a significant contribution to computing at the university  the 2013 supercomputer is named for samuel conte who helped establish the nation s first computer science program at purdue in 1962 and served as department head for 17 years  supercomputers like college football teams have national rankings but unlike the disputable college rankings supercomputers are ranked according to a standardized benchmarking test and then ranked by the nonprofit organization top500 org  the rankings include supercomputers owned by governments corporations research centers and universities the results of the test are published twice each year in june and november on the organization s website  http www top500 org the top 10 university owned supercomputers in the united states and their rankings on the june 2013 list are   i m afraid our campus has become a bit blas about having the nation s largest campus supercomputer mccartney says i think some people on campus have come to expect it   one person who is excited about purdue s computing resources is joseph francisco the university s william e moore professor of physical chemistry and former national president of the american chemical society  francisco conducts research on atmospheric gasses that contribute to global warming and he attributes at least part of his success to the computing resources at purdue   the more of those interactions you account for in your calculations the closer it gets you to the real interactions in the atmosphere francisco says   what we re able to do with purdue s community clusters is really push the envelope francisco s ability to push the envelope of research contributed to his being elected to the national academy of sciences one of the highest honors given to a scientist or engineer in the united states   i wouldn t have been elected to the national academy of sciences without these clusters francisco says having the clusters we were able to set a very high standard that led a lot of people around the world to use our work as a benchmark which is the kind of thing that gets the attention of the national academy   in addition to francisco s work on atmospheric chemistry other research that will be done on conte includes jeff greeley associate professor of chemical engineering is working to make batteries smaller lighter and longer lasting through atom scale models   greg blaisdell professor of aeronautics and astronautics is working to make jets quieter by modeling the exhaust flow using as many as one billion data points   gerhard klimeck professor of electrical and computer engineering is creating atom scale models of future computer processor components and their quantum interactions   michael baldwin associate professor of earth atmospheric and planetary sciences is developing high resolution weather forecast models   wen jiang associate professor of biology is determining the structure of viruses at the atomic level and is developing high resolution images of the actual viruses   the high performance computing is key jiang says i can t imagine what we would do without these large clusters conte is different from previous purdue cluster type supercomputers because of its heavy use of parallel processing conducted by the intel xenon phi coprocessors  conte has 580 servers 570 at the time of testing with 9 120 standard cores and 68 400 phi cores for a total of 77 520 cores  by comparison the four other supercomputers also in operation at purdue have a combined 46 152 cores mccartney says purdue staff worked closely with two of the university s foundational it partners intel and hewlett packard to develop conte   the work that these companies have done has been exceptional but what really struck me was the commitment by both companies to help us develop top resources for our science and engineering faculty mccartney says  conte was built at a cost of 4 6 million of which 2 million will come from faculty members contributing a portion of their federal research funding through the university s community cluster program   may 2008 steele 26 8 teraflops sustained measured maximum speed 67 33 teraflops peak

aS' purdue expert black friday isn t just for november west lafayette ind black friday isn t what people think it is says richard feinberg a purdue university professor of consumer sciences and retailing  black friday the day after thanksgiving has been promoted as the day that kicks off the holiday shopping season it is named black friday because going back to the 1970s sales from then through the end of the year have helped push retailers into profitability   the retail season has already begun he says in promotions and advertising that begin as early as september retailers are using key words and phrases that signal holiday shopping for consumers   door buster sales aren t just for the friday after thanksgiving they re for any friday in october now feinberg warns that a heavy and early holiday promotion environment can backfire on retailers   as consumers are bombarded with more promotions it is getting more difficult to get them excited about sales he says at some point their eyes glaze over and it s nearly impossible to get their attention   one reason for the early promotions this year is a late thanksgiving with just 25 shopping days between then and christmas compared to 32 last year  despite that purdue research shows that the number of shopping days doesn t predict the amount of money that will be spent feinberg says  another reason is that retailers face an increasingly competitive environment with more stores and more internet shopping meanwhile the traditional black friday still has it fans   black friday has become a giant sporting event for both retailers and consumers feinberg says consumers love the competition and love getting home recounting their battle stories as they unwrap their new large screen tv   while black friday is no longer the busiest shopping day of the year it is in the top 10 and should not be ignored by any sized retailer feinberg says  black friday sales mean money in the bank and might even convince shoppers to come back in the following weeks '

aS' purdue expert holiday retail sales likely to lag behind last year west lafayette ind retail sales this holiday season won t be as strong as last year s predicts richard feinberg a purdue university professor of consumer sciences and retailing  feinberg cites the end of a social security tax reduction along with lingering high rates of unemployment and underemployment as possible causes for stagnant spending  he expects retail sales to range from flat to 5 percent lower than last year he calls any suggestion of an increase over last year overly optimistic   the end of the social security tax reduction means families have 700 to 1 000 less in spendable income this year that translates to anywhere from 82 billion to 117 billion that consumers had last year that they don t have this year feinberg says   and this hasn t been made up by any rise in income or employment holiday sales are crucial to retailers they account for about 20 percent of annual retail sales and about 35 percent of profit feinberg says  but this year retailers appear to be cutting back on holiday season inventory which will limit what they have on hand even if sales pick up he says  the one area of likely increase is online sales feinberg predicts online ordering will increase from 10 percent to 15 percent over last year  still online represents less than 10 percent of all retail sales he notes feinberg says there is a caveat to all holiday sales predictions any number of external events can significantly affect holiday retail sales  consumer spending is sensitive to poor weather government inaction leading to shutdowns gasoline prices and geopolitical situations at home and abroad   source richard feinberg xdj1 purdue edu'

aS' purdue expert offers research update on cornstalk nitrate tests west lafayette ind end of season cornstalk nitrate tests conducted over a series of years can help corn growers better manage nitrogen by showing whether soil nitrogen applied during the season met or exceeded crop needs a purdue extension agronomist says  farmers can use the results to choose the best nitrogen source application timing placement and rates the test works because as corn approaches physiological maturity plants that don t have access to enough nitrogen will take nitrate from the lower stalk and move it to the ear  conversely if a plant has too much nitrogen nitrate accumulates in the lower portion of the stalk in order for cornstalk nitrate test csnt results to help farmers alter their nitrogen management programs the test needs to be conducted in multiple years  jim camberato said in a recent research update in purdue extension s pest and crop newsletter multiple seasons of csnt evaluation are warranted before altering an n management program because the optimum rate varies from season to season he said  the reason for the variation is that a series of factors affect the optimum rate they include differences in soil nitrogen supply loss of nitrogen from the root zone and differences in corn hybrid nitrogen use  pests and weeds also can affect the amount of nitrogen used the average correct n rate for maximizing profit over the long term is almost certainly wrong in any one season either too much or too little camberato said   thus the evaluation of an n management system with the csnt or any other n assessment tool on any given field in a single season is interesting but not particularly useful in making management decisions for future years   instead he recommended that growers maintain a database of end of season cornstalk nitrate tests and that they consider all of the data before adjusting fertilizer based nitrogen management programs  the best way to conduct a cornstalk nitrate test is to take 15 or more 8 inch stalk segments beginning 6 inches above the soil surface from representative areas of a field  the samples need to be collected within a few weeks after black layer the point when corn is considered physiologically mature  they can then be sent to a lab and analyzed for nitrate nitrogen no3 n and the results can be compared with recommended rates in indiana  nitrate concentrations between 450 parts per million and 2 000 parts per million are considered optimal while anything higher than 2 000 ppm is considered excessive camberato said  more in depth information about cornstalk nitrate testing is available in purdue extension s free bulletin cornstalk testing to evaluate the nitrogen status of mature corn nitrogen management assurance  the bulletin can be downloaded through purdue extension s the education store by searching for ay 322 w '

aS' purdue expert retailers dealing with showrooming  west lafayette ind as the holiday buying season progresses one trend retailers will have to deal with is showrooming says richard feinberg a purdue university professor of consumer sciences and retailing  showrooming describes shoppers who go into a store to look at a product then use a smartphone to search for the item at a cheaper price often buying on the internet  feinberg says that the amount of showrooming being done is a small part of buying but because most retailers operate at the margin of profitability if even as few as 1 percent of customers are showrooming it can make a difference in whether sales increase over the year before  he also notes that the use of showrooming is likely to grow the easier using a smart device becomes for searching and ordering the more likely showrooming will become a major problem for retailers   most showroomers are under 35 feinberg says so if a retailer s target market is the under 35 buyer showrooming is more of a concern  feinberg says one way retailers are fighting showrooming is through price matching which can keep the sale in the store at the price the consumer wants to pay  purdue research has shown that price matching isn t used a lot because consumers are unaware or they don t like the possibility of confrontation and because sales associates often don t like dealing with it  feinberg says one of the best ways retailers can combat showrooming is with strong private brands that can t be purchased anywhere else  but the bottom line he says is the relationship the retailer has with the consumer have a great product at a great price and a strong loyalty program and consumers won t showroom he says  source richard feinberg xdj1 purdue edu'

aS' purdue forage specialist evaluate alfalfa stands this fall west lafayette ind farmers should not ignore alfalfa fields after the final harvest of the season but instead should assess stands to determine if any limestone nutrients or reseeding plans are necessary a purdue extension forage specialist says  alfalfa is a high quality forage well suited as a component of many rations for ruminant livestock and horses the perennial plant requires a higher soil ph ranging from 6 6 to 7 2 than most other forages and agronomic crops  because changing soil ph can take time keith johnson said producers should look at their alfalfa stands now to see if they are adequate or if new seeding should be planned in the spring of 2014   producers should evaluate the density of the stand and determine if soil fertility diseases too frequent harvest or other stresses might be the reason for the decline he said  over time alfalfa plant density naturally lessens thickening a stand is difficult because alfalfa does not readily reseed itself and over seeding is not successful because of competition with existing plants and autotoxicity a process in which established alfalfa produces a chemical that can reduce establishment and growth of new plants  according to purdue university research a satisfactory population is approximately 35 well growing stems per square foot knowing the plant density gives producers a benchmark to measure how well their alfalfa is doing   if the stand is thin it may be wise to consider establishing a new field in 2014 johnson said when choosing a new field location growers need to remember that alfalfa prefers a well drained and deep soil  they also need to review labels of herbicides used in fields in 2013 for the plant back restriction for alfalfa if a soil test has not been taken in the past couple of years it would be advised to get one taken immediately he said   if soil ph is low growers should follow through with limestone application yet this fall soil ph change is not immediate after limestone application so getting it applied at least six months in advance of seeding is best   information about alfalfa production is available in purdue extension s forage field guide the guides can be purchased for 7 each from purdue extension s the education store by searching id 317 '

university photo steven yang download photo west lafayette ind the many accounts of the rivalry between abraham lincoln and stephen douglas often neglect their differing opinions and arguments about expanding slavery outside of the united states says a purdue university historian   many historians writing about the causes of the civil war do so without mentioning the contentious issue of new united states slave states in the tropics including cuba and mexico says robert e  may a professor of american history while forgotten today the possibility helped ignite lincoln s feud with douglas and the southern outrage at lincoln s election that led to the civil war  the united states did not go to war because lincoln and his republican party intended to end slavery in the south but rather because republicans intended to stop slavery s growth in latin america as well as in kansas and the west  it s critical to understand what caused the war that still resonates with so many people today this is the 150th anniversary of the civil war which was fought from 1861 1865  may s new book slavery race and conquest in the tropics was published this month by cambridge university press the book focuses on lincoln s doing everything he could to stop slavery s growth southward while douglas the u s  senator from illinois wanted the united states to own much or all of latin america even if slavery went along with it may s research also provides new findings on lincoln s surprising and controversial attempt in the midst of the civil war to colonize blacks in haiti as a step toward ending u s  slavery historians may says often misunderstand the relation between lincoln s colony and the emancipation proclamation lincoln came to see latin america as a variant of the west and the western united states was where poor northern whites could go to seek their fortunes and a new life  lincoln saw the same opportunities for free blacks in latin america may says but the attempt became an embarrassment many died and the colonists had to be rescued by the navy  confederate propagandists had a field day making fun of lincoln for claiming to care about black people yet sending them to haiti to die   may s book includes biographies of douglas and lincoln and their relationship which began in the illinois statehouse and it shows how news of slave state plots to spread slavery to latin america kept recycling through their careers and affecting their rivalry for the presidency   the lincoln douglas rivalry is arguably the most famous political rivalry in america s history and yet one of the most contentious things they argued about including in six of the seven famous lincoln douglas debates is often entirely missing from the history books may says   there are many books about the rivalry that don t even mention the word cuba in them or slavery s spread to mexico and central america  most people don t know the full story because there has been so much preoccupation with the issue of slavery expansion into kansas   may says that while the civil war is often studied through a domestic lens more of an international perspective is starting to emerge  in the last 10 years historians have written about the south s trade diplomacy and cultural ties with latin american countries leading up to the civil war as well as southern aggressions to take them over   lincoln was opposed to expansion and imperialistic policies and his philosophy is something that we can learn from today may says   he gave a different model for the united states to follow he believed america was the last great hope for democracy and it should be a model of democracy instead of a conquering democracy  when he died there was an outpouring of grief in latin american countries with days of mourning if america today followed his non interventionist approach to foreign policy we d probably have better relations with countries like venezuela   the timeline in may s book begins in the 1840s as united states policies began to focus more internationally under presidents john tyler and james polk with texas annexation and the mexican war  prior to this time lincoln and douglas were focused on illinois state politics but their political careers ascended as america s international interests expanded  may s research is based especially on lincoln s and douglas s correspondence

by mel chua purdue doctoral candidate in engineering education in his laboratory  alexander has created a computer algorithm that could make it possible for hearing aids to help people with severe hearing loss to hear high frequency sounds such as s sh f and th   purdue research foundation photo download photo west lafayette ind mel chua a purdue university doctoral candidate in engineering education received her current set of hearing aids in may 2012  she has severe hearing loss but has not worn hearing aids most of her adult life because they did not offer a significant improvement to her hearing   i got my first hearing aids before i started kindergarten she said i refused to wear them in fifth grade and i more or less went without them except for brief interludes at ages 16 and 20  i tried them at those times and decided they weren t helping me chua said hearing aids didn t help her because she was still missing a lot of speech sounds especially high frequency sounds like s and sh   when i competed in school and district spelling bees in elementary and middle school i had to ask if the word i was supposed to spell was singular or plural she said   i couldn t hear the high frequency s sound at the end of words an innovation developed by a purdue researcher in the college of health and human sciences may make it possible for people with severe hearing loss like chua to hear high frequency sounds like s sh f and th  joshua alexander an assistant professor in purdue s department of speech language and hearing sciences explained why conventional hearing aids do not help listeners with severe hearing loss   people with severe hearing loss have lost the ability to hear certain pitches and most commonly they re the highest pitches he said   current hearing aid technology works best for people with some residual ability to hear these pitches but there are too many challenges for it to help listeners with a very restricted pitch range   alexander tested variants of existing hearing aid technology which use algorithms to move information from higher pitches into a lower pitch range   those who need this technology the most are people like mel unfortunately because their pitch range is so limited everything is placed into a very narrow area which makes different speech sounds too similar to one another  there is less to separate them he said listeners have to relearn how to perceive a lot of information in the new pitch range assuming the sounds can be made different from one another in the first place   rather than design an algorithm and hope that listeners perception would accommodate to it alexander discovered what listeners needed to enhance perception in the new pitch range  he then designed an algorithm to accommodate these perceptual needs unlike other algorithms that simply shift high frequency sounds to a lower pitch range this algorithm mirrors and flips them  by moving the highest pitched speech sounds like s to the lowest pitches the listener can more easily relearn them because they are still different from other speech sounds in the mid pitch range like sh he said   this also means the listener doesn t need to relearn the speech sounds in the mid pitch range because the algorithm hasn t displaced them as far  most of the change is at the extremities alexander said the algorithm takes advantage of other differences between speech sounds to enhance perception and that multiple features can be customized for each listener  it is meant to complement existing hearing aid technology rather than compete against it and it may even be used in conjunction with cochlear implants which are surgically implanted electronic devices   a new protocol is to give the person with a cochlear implant a hearing aid too implants give the high pitches that a listener is missing but not the low he said   the algorithm could provide redundancy as the listener hears high pitches from both the implant and the hearing aid alexander spoke about his innovation during the international hearing aid conference in lake tahoe calif  he has received funding from a national institutes of health challenge grant and purdue s entrepreneurial leadership academy the next steps to develop the innovation include finding partners to fully test the algorithm place it in hearing aids and validate it with additional testing  the purdue office of technology commercialization has filed a patent application on alexander s algorithm for more information about developing and commercializing

aS' purdue innovation kills waterborne microorganisms produces safer drinking water west lafayette ind whether turning on a tap to fill a container or drinking from a fountain people in developed countries normally have readily available and inexpensive access to a clean safe water supply  that is not the case for more than 800 million people in developing countries according to ernest chip r blatchley iii professor of civil engineering and environmental and ecological engineering at purdue university blatchley and other researchers are working to provide safe water supplies for these people by using ultraviolet uv radiation from the sun to purify water   millions of people in developing countries do not have readily available water or they become sick because of the water they drink he said   people in these countries may not have the infrastructure or financial resources to clean the water deliver it and keep it clean until it s used  common problems include microbial pathogens which are largely associated with human and animal waste blatchley and bruce applegate associate professor of food science and biological sciences at purdue university have developed prototypes of a water disinfection system to take advantage of uv radiation from the sun which is plentiful in many areas where clean water is lacking   if you take a global view of people who have little or no access to safe water you ll see that most live close to the equator blatchley said   bruce student researchers and i have created prototypes that disinfect water by amplifying and concentrating solar uv radiation which is abundant in equatorial and near equatorial nations   applegate said the purdue water disinfection system pumps water through a uv transparent pipe placed on a parabolic reflector   the shape of the reflective mirror concentrates the sun s uv rays so the radiation inside the pipe is more intense than outside he said   the radiation damages the dna in microorganisms when this is done the microbes can no longer grow and the water is safe solar uv systems have been developed by other groups  the purdue system however uses different materials than others we are using the range of solar uv wavelengths that are most effective for damaging microorganisms dna  using material that is transparent to these wavelengths of radiation allows us to disinfect water a lot faster blatchley said   we can pump water continuously through the system and produce water in a larger quantity blatchley and applegate have conducted experiments in west lafayette using non pathogenic bacteria that are very closely related to those that cause cholera and typhoid  blatchley said the results from the experiments could translate to the field where disease causing microorganisms and higher levels of uv radiation exist   we have information about how uv irradiance in west lafayette compares to cities around the world including port au prince haiti and the kenyan cities of eldoret and mombasa he said   the maximum solar irradiance that occurs in west lafayette is similar to the minimum values observed in these near equatorial cities  the experiments we conduct here where we have had success should be at least as successful if they were conducted in port au prince eldoret and mombasa and probably quite a bit more   having proven the concept of concentrating uv rays to disinfect water the researchers now are determining how to scale up production in the system  the prototypes currently produce water at a rate of about 10 20 milliliters per minute the original prototypes were intentionally built on a small scale so we could conduct experiments using a relatively modest amount of time and resources blatchley said   we have ideas on how we expect it to scale up and we plan to demonstrate those the purdue office of technology commercialization has filed an international application for patent of the innovation purdue university s other patented technologies include new cancer treatments alternative fuels biomedical devices agriculture innovations and others that are available for licensing through the office of technology commercialization  for more information call 765 588 3475 email otcip prf org or visit otc prf org otc the purdue office of technology commercialization operates one of the most comprehensive technology transfer programs among leading research universities in the united states services provided by this office support the economic development initiatives of purdue university and benefit the university s academic activities  '

aS' purdue officials report on state of commercialization research and information technology west lafayette ind purdue university officials presented the state national and global impact of purdue s economic development research and information technology initiatives to the board of trustees on friday feb  8 joseph b hornett senior vice president treasurer and coo of purdue research foundation richard o buckius purdue s vice president for research and gerry mccartney chief information officer and vice president for information technology presented reports at the meeting  hornett reported that the 175 u s patent applications filed are a 41 percent increase over the previous year and that 110 global patents were received by purdue a 26 percent increase  royalties for purdue s commercialized technologies reached 8 7 million marking a 22 percent increase over the prior year hornett said that over the same time period purdue ranks first for patent applications and second for invention disclosures in the big ten   the marked increase in disclosures and patent applications exemplifies the commitment purdue faculty staff and students have to making a global contribution by actively commercializing their discoveries hornett said   one particular area of growth is in student entrepreneurship in the past fiscal year we have seen tremendous growth in patents filed for students through the purdue office of technology commercialization   in the 2011 filing period 355 purdue students filed patents a 62 percent increase over the 218 filed the prior year hornett also said that the purdue research park which is managed by the foundation now has 239 companies that employ about 4 250 people  individuals working in the park network earn an average annual wage of 63 000 buckius reported that new sponsored program awards totaled nearly 354 million for the 2012 fiscal year down from the previous year s 420 million due in part to the spending down of the american recovery and reinvestment act arra funding received in prior years  he also reported a 12 percent increase in sponsored program awards from industrial and foundation sources and a 19 percent increase in research expenditures over the previous fiscal year   purdue has a strong record of building industry and foundation partnerships which is especially important as the future economic environment may mean a decrease in research funding opportunities from the federal government buckius said   these lasting and productive partnerships are a fundamental part of the research endeavors taking place at purdue as well as a driver of economic development for the state and the nation   the university s roughly 650 million in research expenditures include money spent on research from funding awarded in previous years as well as cost share commitments and facility and administration costs   there has been rapid growth in the university s research endeavors over the past five years as shown by the trend in research expenditures buckius said   based on reporting to nsf excluding medical schools of our peers in fiscal year 2011 purdue expended more than 50 million above the mean expenditures of our peers yet ranks 9th out of 15 with our aspirational and big ten peers   during the fiscal years of 2009 to 2011 purdue experienced a temporary increase in awards due to grants received through arra which accounted for 24 percent of the record 438 million in sponsored program awards in 2010  arra funding fell to a fraction of 1 percent of the total for the 2012 fiscal year from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2012 excluding the small contributions from arra support in those years purdue s awards increased by 6 percent   14 5 million from the national science foundation to the purdue led network for computational nanotechnology cyber platform   10 million from the regenstrief foundation to purdue s regenstrief center for healthcare engineering the national institute of standards and technology nist and u s  department of commerce awarded a contract with a value of up to 9 9 million to researchers from purdue and a consortium of engineering companies for the nist disaster and failure studies program  mccartney who also is the olga oesterle england professor of information technology pointed out that purdue s ability to provide research instructional and computational resources to a global audience is a significant reason why it hosts facilities such as the network for computational nanotechnology  but he said recent rapid changes in technology and in the delivery of information is creating an even greater around the clock demand for purdue resources and expertise   people think of the university offices closing at 5 p m and many here do but we are increasingly becoming an always on university mccartney said   purdue serves a global audience that requests and uses our services 24 hours a day this always on demand will continue to rapidly increase due to the international growth of mobile phones   three fourths of the world s population already has access to a mobile phone or device mccartney said this gives the world access to purdue in ways that were hardly imagined before   purdue is already a leading developer of mobile apps that aid in student learning but mccartney said future plans to respond to the changes in technology include not only increased development of tools and resources for mobile devices but also close novel partnerships with industry leading corporations  one such partnership is a licensing agreement announced at the meeting with pearson higher education which will include information from purdue s online writing lab owl in its digital textbooks  '

aS' purdue professor part of national study of science education specialists west lafayette ind a new type of science faculty those who specialize in science education is on the rise but less than half have formal training in education according to a recent study  nancy pelaez a purdue university associate professor of biological sciences was part of a team that performed the first large scale study of u s  science faculty with education specialties this new type of position exists within science departments and focuses on improving undergraduate and kindergarten through 12th grade science education  the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that 94 percent of the respondents had originally been trained in basic research and 43 percent had formal training in science education such as a master s doctoral degree or graduate fellowship in science education or a k 12 teaching credential   education training provides important skills and tools that someone trained in basic research may not possess for instance techniques to evaluate students and reach those who are struggling with material said pelaez who founded the purdue international biology education research group those without that training may only look at test results as an assessment measure  a poor test result identifies a student who is having problems with the material but it doesn t tell the nature or reason for those problems  it also typically comes at a point where it will be difficult to intervene and re engage the student those who have studied or had training in education in addition to their science background better know how to look at the whole process and ways to improve it   the study also found that faculty in these positions at master s degree granting institutions were more likely to have formal training in science education at 60 9 percent than those at doctoral degree granting institutions at 39 3 percent  despite having a smaller percentage of faculty trained in science education the study found that faculty at doctoral degree granting institutions had higher success rates in obtaining funding for science education research and projects   this is an emerging field and these discrepancies may be due to a lack of a critical mass of people with this training and expertise pelaez said   it may be that panels making funding decisions don t understand the value of science education training that will likely shift as more and more individuals obtain this expertise and sit on such panels   the national science foundation funded study included 289 science faculty with education specialties from 45 states washington d c   and puerto rico science faculty with education specialties is a widespread and growing group pelaez said it is clear science departments recognize the value in these positions in improving teaching and learning because such positions were found across the nation and within different types of institutions   although this type of faculty is on the rise there are only a handful of programs training them pelaez said some of the science faculty with education specialties may be seeking to educate themselves but aren t finding many opportunities to do so she said   we need to increase the opportunities available it doesn t have to happen in a set prescribed way but it is important for them to obtain these skills  knowing science is only one part of being a great teacher of science or researcher of science education methods purdue offers doctoral degree programs to train graduate students in biology chemistry and physics to do education work  in addition purdue s international biology education research group collaborates with science faculty across the united states and internationally to provide opportunities for formal training in science education and holds weekly open meetings where any faculty member or student can come to learn more about science education she said  pelaez is a member of a collaborative team of six co authors who contributed equally to this research in addition to pelaez the research team includes seth bush of california polytechnic state university james

part of a research team that performed a 2008 study of the characteristics and training of science faculty with education specialties in the california state university system  a paper detailing that study was published in the journal science widespread distribution and unexpected variation among science faculty with education specialties sfes across the united states seth d bush nancy j pelaez james a rudd ii michael t stevens kimberly d tanner and kathy s williams college and university science departments are increasingly taking an active role in improving science education  perhaps as a result a new type of specialized science faculty position within science departments is emerging referred to here as science faculty with education specialties where individual scientists focus their professional efforts on strengthening undergraduate science education improving kindergarten through 12th grade science education and conducting discipline based education research  numerous assertions assumptions and questions about sfes exist yet no national studies have been published here we present findings from a large scale study of u s  sfes who are widespread and increasing in numbers contrary to many assumptions sfes were indeed found across the nation across science disciplines and most notably across primarily undergraduate master of science granting and ph d   granting institutions data also reveal unexpected variations among sfes by institution type among respondent sfes at master of science granting institutions were almost twice as likely to have formal training in science education compared with other sfes  in addition sfes at ph d granting institutions were much more likely to have obtained science education funding surprisingly formal training in science education provided no advantage in obtaining science education funding  our findings show that the sfes phenomenon is likely more complex and diverse than anticipated with differences being more evident across institution types than across science disciplines  these findings raise questions about the origins of differences among sfes and are useful to science departments interested in hiring sfes scientific trainees preparing for sfes careers and agencies awarding science education funding  '

chemical instrumentation  r graham cooks the henry bohn hass distinguished professor of chemistry won the biennial international prize in recognition of his innovations in the field of mass spectrometry and analytical chemistry   graham cooks has invented technology for quick chemical analysis that has applications ranging from medicine to food safety to national security said purdue president mitch daniels   his work has led to more than 40 patents and four companies as well as the establishment of purdue s internationally recognized center for analytical instrumentation development  advances made in his laboratory have not only shaped his field of science but also created tools to keep us safer and to make medical tests easier and treatments more precise  it is a testament to dr cooks exceptional work that he is recognized with the prestigious dreyfus prize the international prize given biennially by the camille and henry dreyfus foundation consists of 250 000 a citation and a medal  a presentation ceremony featuring a lecture by cooks will be held at purdue in the fall chemical instrumentation has shaped human life in a myriad of positive ways said henry c  walter president of the dreyfus foundation graham cooks is a consummate innovator and it is a great pleasure to recognize him with the third dreyfus prize   cooks is a pioneer in the field of mass spectrometry which identifies the contents of a sample by measuring the mass of its ions or electrically charged molecules  early in his career cooks revolutionized the field through the development of tandem mass spectrometry which allowed for the quantification of the molecules present as well as their identification  he later developed ambient ionization techniques that paved the way for faster more portable mass spectrometry devices the techniques eliminated the need for samples to be chemically manipulated and contained in a vacuum chamber for analysis and allowed testing to be done in the air or directly on a surface in its natural environment  cooks and his collaborator purdue associate professor of biomedical engineering and electrical and computer engineering zheng ouyang then miniaturized the once sedan sized mass spectrometer to a shoebox sized device ready to leave the laboratory  the mini mass spectrometers have been likened to star trek s tricorder device which can instantly identify the molecules present on a surface or in the air  cooks and his team have fine tuned the tools for use in molecular imaging for cancer diagnostics and surgery therapeutic drug monitoring testing for biomarkers in urine and the identification of food borne pathogens bacteria pesticides and explosives residues   mass spectrometry has had an extraordinary impact on modern science and graham cooks has changed the field in many important ways said richard n  zare the marguerite blake wilbur professor in natural science at stanford university and a dreyfus foundation board member he has developed critical new experimental instruments and methods and applied them to solve significant problems   cooks earned his bachelor s degree and doctorate from the university of natal south africa and a doctorate from cambridge university  he has been at purdue since 1971 cooks many honors include american chemical society awards in chemical instrumentation mass spectrometry analytical chemistry and the f a cotton award  he has been recognized internationally with both the robert boyle medal and the centennial prize of the royal society of chemistry  cooks is the author of more than 900 scientific papers and has directed the doctoral research of more than 100 graduate students many of whom hold positions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  he is associated with several purdue research centers including bindley bioscience center the purdue center for cancer research and the center for analytical instrumentation development  the camille and henry dreyfus foundation based in new york is a leading non profit organization devoted to the advancement of the chemical sciences  it was established in 1946 by chemist inventor and businessman camille dreyfus who directed that the foundation s purpose be to advance the science of chemistry chemical engineering and related sciences as a means of improving human relations and circumstances   in broad terms foundation programs advance young faculty of early accomplishment develop leadership in environmental chemistry and enhance chemistry education and public interest in chemistry  the

online science and engineering gateway the purdue led cyber platform a part of the network for computational nanotechnology ncn will assist researchers across the globe by developing a virtual society that shares simulation software data and other innovative content to provide engineers and scientists with the fundamental knowledge required to advance nanoscience into nanotechnology   thousands of times a day the leading researchers come to purdue through the globally unique tool of nanohub purdue president mitch daniels said tuesday feb  5 in announcing the grant the new nsf investment is an affirmation of the brilliance of nanohub s purdue creators and of its worldwide scientific significance   annually nearly 250 000 users in 172 countries participate in nanohub an online meeting place for simulation research collaboration teaching learning and publishing  the nanohub provides a library of 267 simulation tools free from the limitations of running software locally used in the scientific computing cloud by more than 12 000 people every year  the internet based initiative provides 3 000 resources from more than 1 000 authors for research and education in the areas of nanoelectronics and nanoelectromechanical systems and their application to nano biosystems  the nanohub menu also includes courses tutorials seminars discussions and facilities to foster nano research collaboration including the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park through cyber platform developments and community engagement efforts the nanohub in its next phase is designed to   accelerate research by transforming nanoscience to nanotechnology through the integration of simulation with experimental data   our long term vision for the cyber platform is to use the nanohub as an online nano society that researchers practitioners educators and students depend on daily said purdue electrical and computer engineering professor gerhard klimeck principal investigator of the purdue led cyber platform   at the same time we are excited about how this tool has extended into professional practice as a computational resource for a multidisciplinary culture of innovation grounded in

abstract go to http www nsf gov awardsearch showaward awd_id 1227110 historicalawards false the nanohub has become the first broadly successful cloud computing environment for research across multiple disciplines with more than 960 citations in scientific literature and 8 000 secondary citations with nearly one third of those papers involving experimental data  it also has evolved well beyond online simulation for research from new york to london and moscow to madrid more than 14 000 students in 760 formal classes at 185 institutions have used nanohub simulations for classroom teaching homework and projects  the nanohub also provides a library of 3 000 learning materials most of these tools are adopted for formal education in six months compared with the 3 8 years it takes for the release of new college textbook editions klimeck said  ncn founding director mark lundstrom the don and carol scifres distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at purdue said a key part of the cyber platform project is to engage an ever larger and more diverse cyber community that shares novel high quality nanoscale computation and simulation research and educational resources   the reason we created the nanohub cyberinfrastructure 10 years ago was to connect those who are doing simulation with experimental collaborators lundstrom said   today it s called cloud computing based in discovery park purdue s primary interdisciplinary research complex the cyber platform team hopes to accelerate the transformation of nanoscience to nanotechnology through the integration of simulation with experimental data  lundstrom said the project will focus on developing open source software to stimulate data sharing and inspire and educate the next generation workforce  a key goal is to create communities in the nano related areas of manufacturing informatics and environmental health and safety   despite a decade of success in nanotechnology research and education significant gaps remain because work is still performed by isolated individuals and small groups lundstrom said   this fragmentation by specialty hinders tool and data sharing across knowledge domains by partnering with professional societies and commercial publishers klimeck said nanohub is changing how researchers publish simulation results through novel interactive journals that reflect a user s workflow link directly back to their data and open doors to more collaborators  this approach will drive new content to the nanohub establishing an efficient one stop shopping site for high powered nano related research simulations he said  ncn also has developed processes for enabling researchers to rapidly deploy their research codes and innovative tutorials and classes on nanohub   to date these processes harvested research and educational results from more than 1 000 contributors worldwide klimeck said   expansion into new areas of nano research and education including precollege education represent a huge growth potential for nanohub that goes beyond simulation to embracing data management search and exploration   with nsf funding purdue launched ncn in 2002 with a five year 10 5 million grant to advance nanoscience toward nanotechnology via online simulations on nanohub org  the nsf funding was distributed among six partner universities to seed the infrastructure creation and develop the nanohub content  today nsf is funding purdue for the operation and advancement of this national nanotechnology infrastructure two other independent nsf grants each at a level of 3 5 million to purdue and the university of illinois urbana champaign will advance nanoelectronic and nano bioengineering while using nanohub to engage a global community  the

aS' purdue software boosts graduation rate 21 percent graduation rates at purdue university are 21 percent higher when students take courses that make use of a data mining and analysis software program called signals  the software which was developed at purdue examines online academic behaviors and warns both the students and the instructors when individuals are at risk of performing poorly in the class  the instructor s view shows the breakdown of students by high medium or low risk purdue university image west lafayette ind   a data mining and analysis software program called signals developed by purdue university has increased six year graduation rates by 21 48 percent according to a recent review of data from the 2007 cohort of students  the increased graduation rates were for students who were in two or more signals enabled classes compared to students who had not taken any signals enabled courses  students who had taken just one signals enabled course graduated 20 87 percent higher than those who had taken none five year graduation data from the 2008 cohort showed that students who had taken two or more signals enabled courses graduated from purdue at a rate that was 24 36 percent higher than students who did not take a signals enabled course  the signals software looks at students online academic behaviors such as whether they opened a reading assignment or completed a set of math exercises  it combines this information with demographic information about the student such as his or her standardized test scores high school gpa and current grades  in all the system uses more than 20 reference datapoints signals then displays a simple and intuitive red yellow or green signal on the student s course website to let them know how they are doing in that course  in addition to the visual warning students also receive messages prepared by the instructors the messages may tell students in the green to keep up the good work for example or remind those with a yellow signal that evening tutoring sessions are available or ask a student who has recently changed from having a yellow signal to one that is red to make an appointment to visit the instructor s office  purdue recently released a web application called passnote that helps instructors write these messages to students using text that research has shown are most effective  gerry mccartney purdue university s cio vice president for information technology and olga oesterle england professor of technology says one strength of signals is that it gives students feedback on how they are doing soon after they arrive on campus   in some courses students might not receive an actual grade until they take their midterm exam halfway through the semester mccartney says   by that time they have already set most of their study behaviors depending on the course assignments signals can begin offering feedback as early as the second week of classes so students have plenty of time to make changes   signals launched as a pilot program in 2007 and rolled out to general campus use in 2008 it has been released as a commercial product by ellucian called coursesignals  each instructor or faculty member can decide whether to incorporate the signals system into their course currently more than 125 courses many of which have multiple sessions have incorporated signals at purdue  matt pistilli research scientist in the teaching and learning area of information technology at purdue says signals provides benefits to instructors too   the application of analytics can transform how a student learns but it can also transform how an instructor teaches pistilli says   faculty who teach may see an unusually high number of students move to the red warning and realize students weren t getting a concept or successfully completing assignments  they can quickly address that in the course and make changes for when they teach the course the next year ultimately the students get better over time but so do the courses   during the six years purdue has been using the signals system the primary surprise to the developers has been that taking more than one signals enabled course significantly increases both retention and graduation for students   for some reason two courses is the magic number taking just one course with course signals is beneficial for students but we ve seen significant improvement when students are enrolled in at least two courses using the system pistilli says   we need to continue to do more research on why this is significant pistilli continues we think it is because if a student gets feedback from two different instructors they can make better links between their performance and their behaviors  for example a student may be taking a course in biology and and another in communications which are very different courses but if they get the same feedback in both courses about study habits and needing to spend more time on task and they hear suggestions on how to improve from two different professors they appear to make the change  what s notable is that this improvement stays with them in their other courses and for the rest of their academic careers staff at purdue continue to incorporate big data techniques in order to boost student success  work has begun on the next generation of course analytics systems which will provide more targeted information for example signals looks at a student s mathematics aptitude but that skill may be more significant in a chemistry class than in a writing course   in the next generation system we want to have multiple algorithms for different departments and eventually for each course at purdue pistilli says   eventually by using artificial intelligence we hope to develop a custom algorithm for each student the next generation academic analytics system at purdue will also pull in data from a separate project currently in development at purdue called students like me   this data analytics program which is being developed with emc corp s pivotal will help students achieve academic goals students like me will then look at similar students who were successful and recommend specific courses student organizations or other activities for the student to consider   signals was just the beginning of how were are planning to use data mining and analytics to improve student success mccartney says   we have seen what a great benefit signals is already but we know there is much more we can do to provide our students information that will make our students

aS' purdue study shale oil and gas a long term boon to economy west lafayette ind the increasing production of shale oil and gas should benefit the u s economy by raising the nation s gross domestic product by an average of 3 5 percent annually through 2035 according to a report by purdue university energy economists   the economic impact of shale oil and gas is clear it is a game changer for the u s economy said wally tyner the james and lois ackerman professor of agricultural economics and one of the researchers  shale oil and gas are found deep underground below conventional oil and far below the water table the oil and gas are produced by injecting chemicals water and sand into the shale rock at high pressure thereby fracturing the shale rock to release the oil and gas which is then brought to the surface  the report summarizes two papers one examining the shale oil and gas boom and the other analyzing potential ramifications of significant exports of natural gas by three researchers in the department of agricultural economics including assistant professor farzad taheripour who was the lead author and postdoctoral associate kemal sarica  the papers were presented in july at the annual north american joint conference of the united states and international associations for energy economics in anchorage alaska  paper summaries now have been made public our results indicate that the shale oil and gas boom should have a major impact on the u s  economy the researchers say with the nation s gross domestic product from 2008 to 2035 averaging 2 2 percent higher than its 2007 level  without the expansion in production from shale the gdp the value of all of the nation s goods and services would average 1 3 percent lower   that means that u s gdp over the entire period of 2008 2035 on average would be 3 5 percent higher each year than it would have been without the shale boom   that amounts to an average of 473 billion per year added to the economy during the period restricting gas exports increases the magnitude of the annual gains to 487 billion according to the report  the shale boom has other benefits to the economy including substantially increasing employment and reducing oil and natural gas prices the report states  on average each year from 2008 to 2035 oil prices would be 7 percent lower and gas prices 12 percent lower than they would have been without the increased production  further if gas exports are restricted prices of natural gas would drop by 24 1 percent and the economy would gain 13 3 billion according to the report  that pales in comparison to a u s economy of 15 trillion the report notes but the analysis shows that restricting the exports provides a small but positive benefit   the report points out that exporting natural gas is economically attractive to the industry because u s prices currently are as little as one fifth the prices in foreign markets  there would be considerable profit to be made even considering the cost of liquefying the gas and shipping it on the other side there is potentially large domestic demand for natural gas in electricity generation industrial applications the transportation sector and for other uses the researchers say   thus the question is which pathway provides the best economic and environmental outcome for the u s permitting major exports of natural gas would result in losses in labor and capital income in all energy intensive sectors and increases in electricity prices according to the report   the bottom line is that caution is in order in approving large levels of exports the researchers say '

aS' purdue to accelerate drug discovery development west lafayette ind adding to purdue s strengths in drug discovery and the capacity to translate basic research into life changing treatments spearheaded by the center for drug discovery is among a series of initiatives being targeted by the university  purdue president mitch daniels in his president s forum on thursday sept 12 highlighted how the center will create an innovative research and teaching environment to stimulate discovery and the translation of basic research into new ways to diagnose and treat disease   here as in other areas we will seek to reinforce existing excellence daniels said purdue has the proven talent knowledge and drive to create new treatments and tools that improve health worldwide  purdue researchers are already hard at work finding the connection between the molecular basis of disease and compounds to change the course of disease  through purdue s center for drug discovery we will accelerate the rate of drug discovery to move revelations from the lab to commercialization and then to the million of patients who need hope and relief   the purdue center for drug discovery supports more than 100 faculty in six colleges and its research will focus on four disease categories cancer diabetes obesity and cardiovascular immune and infectious disease and neurological disorders and trauma  joining daniels at the forum were philip low the ralph c corley distinguished professor of chemistry and inaugural director of the center and timothy ratliff professor and the robert wallace miller director of the purdue university center for cancer research ratliff low and directors of other purdue centers with research focused on the disease targets will meet regularly to share discoveries and ensure a unified efficient progression of the research   this new purdue center will advance the level of research among our faculty and the educational experience of our research driven and entrepreneurially focused undergraduate and graduate students low said   it will encourage collaboration it will bring people and their distinctive talents together accelerating our rates of discovery and translation  and it sends the message to the world that purdue university is committed to excellence in the field of drug discovery and development   purdue has strengths along all of the points of the drug discovery pipeline including a premier structural biology group with a track record of discovering new targets to block disease a chemistry department that has produced two nobel laureates and is a leader in structure based drug design and top ranked engineering and pharmacy programs ratliff said   purdue has all the fundamentals and a history of getting things done including more than 30 compounds at various stages of clinical development he said   if we build on this strength and put infrastructure in place to overcome the remaining challenges the university can bring many more potentially life changing or life saving drugs to the clinic   in addition 14 core units are in place to provide shared resources for analysis screening synthesis and testing of potential therapeutic compounds he said   we don t want any potential new treatment to fail because there isn t a resource to move it forward ratliff said perhaps the professor who made the discovery doesn t have the expertise for the next step in the process  we want to make it easy for one professor to pass the torch to another and to draw on the reserves of our talented research staff to finish the marathon of drug discovery in record time   the new center will help increase funding from federal agencies and industry low said in a time of reduced overall federal support investment in drug discovery remains strong  purdue also will be in a unique position to capitalize on a trend by major pharmaceutical companies to outsource research and development to universities and biotechnology firms he said  the industry spent 9 4 billion in outsourcing its r d in 2011 kalorama information reports purdue is among an elite handful of universities that are very productive in this area and we are well positioned to partner with the pharmaceutical industry and become a world leader in drug discovery low said  estimates also show that it costs approximately 1 4 billion and takes 10 years to bring a new prescription drug to the market and pharmaceutical companies want to be confident in a drug candidate before pursuing it  that means compounds already through early testing and validation are much more competitive low said taking a discovery further along the drug development path which is what this center is all about is much more lucrative for the researcher and the university he said   the greatest return on research investment is right after establishing a proof of principle and taking a discovery through to this point means the difference between thousands and millions of dollars for the university  these revenues represent money that can be put back into discovery research and thereby further enhance our potential to change the world   other goals of the purdue center for drug discovery which will be a part of discovery park and located in a state of the art facility opening next spring in the life and health sciences park on the south end of campus include   the center advances purdue s primary mission to move discoveries from the laboratories to benefit citizens this will be accomplished as purdue researchers translate discoveries into the clinic and then into commercial use and through training courses in the development of startup companies all of which will contribute to the state s economy   advancing its role as a research leader in this area purdue becomes even more competitive in gaining larger research grants from state and federal agencies such as the national institutes of health national science foundation the u s  department of defense and major foundations and philanthropic organizations cutting edge facilities are a magnet for attracting leading faculty and top tier students  this also accelerates efforts to develop a curriculum and a learning culture that focuses on all aspects of the drug discovery pipeline from discovery and development to the patenting of technology and processes that can be commercialized for greater and immediate impact   students will get to experience all parts of the drug discovery process and see what it takes to get all the way through ratliff said   our students also will have the opportunity to be trained for careers in very popular and in demand areas more details on the initiatives will be provided by daniels throughout the fall semester  the initiatives were selected and developed over several months of work that involved deans faculty and others at the university  purdue s trustees also have reviewed and given support for the program '

administered by the school of mechanical engineering   purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind purdue university on nov 8 will unveil a new building and facilities for the expansion of the ray w herrick laboratories a hub of industry oriented research in areas ranging from advanced automotive technologies to smart buildings  the dedication will be at 3 30 p m in the new 68 000 square foot building located east of the existing herrick building on russell drive  construction began in october 2011 the new herrick building roughly doubles the size of the labs which are administered by the school of mechanical engineering the herrick labs have provided an important bridge between university research and industry giving our best students opportunities based on real world applications while helping corporations improve products and productivity said purdue president mitch daniels  about one third of the project s cost was funded by the national institute of standards and technology which provided 11 75 million  the remainder came largely from private donors including 3 5 million from alumnus roger gatewood a 2 million contribution from alumnus gerald d  hines 3 5 million from the ford fund and a more than 1 million in kind donation from carrier the company s founder willis carrier inventor of modern air conditioning is honored with a laboratory named after him  herrick s current facilities such as an advanced engine test area will be replaced and expanded support from cummins inc for engine research at herrick includes 1 million toward the building project  the new facility also will house components of federal aviation administration multi university centers specializing in studying the environment inside the cabin of a commercial airliner and the impact of aircraft noise  the new building houses the center for high performance buildings where research is focused on equipment and operational technologies to make possible future buildings that are safer more environmentally and user friendly energy efficient productive and comfortable  buildings are responsible for roughly 40 percent of the nation s energy use 71 percent of electricity consumption and 38 percent of carbon dioxide emissions  americans typically spend more than 90 percent of their time indoors while 20 percent to 30 percent of occupants have health problems related to indoor environments according to a project report prepared by purdue and nist an agency of the u s  department of commerce our aim is to create buildings that are better for the environment more comfortable and healthier for people said leah jamieson purdue s john a  edwardson dean of engineering these improvements will lead to buildings that positively impact the health and productivity of occupants   the economic impact related to health and lost productivity caused by poor indoor environments is estimated to be about 200 billion per year in the united states according to the report  poor indoor environments can cause respiratory illness allergies and asthma sick building syndrome and musculoskeletal disorders  buildings located near busy roads trains and airports are susceptible to air quality issues noise and vibration which potentially lead to effects such as sleep disturbance hypertension and heart disease  a special feature will be a living laboratory a working office wing designed with replaceable modular elements including windows a reconfigurable air distribution and lighting system and instrumentation to monitor and assess the environment within the offices and its impact on occupants   the living laboratory will allow researchers to test and validate new systems and concepts within a real world setting to evaluate energy performance and occupant response said james braun director of the new center for high performance buildings  one of the major challenges will be to develop an understanding of the relationships between indoor environments and human health and productivity leading to the design of better building systems said patricia davies director of the herrick laboratories and professor of mechanical engineering her work is part of a multidisciplinary research group that will use a perception based engineering laboratory in herrick  the ford fund donated the 3 5 million toward this laboratory and associated research work in the perception based engineering lab is focused on understanding factors that contribute to people s perception and responses to engineered systems and environments  in the context of high performance buildings that work is focused on examining the factors contributing to occupant comfort and performance   an example of a use of this laboratory is to simulate aspects of building environments and determine how noise temperature humidity and lighting affect comfort  such models can be used to guide decisions on environmental controls and building designs to improve occupant comfort davies said  the herrick labs were established in the 1950s with a grant from ray w herrick then ceo of tecumseh products co in tecumseh mich   after mechanical engineering professor bill fontaine had spent a summer working at the company fontaine became the first director of the laboratories  since then about 900 purdue students have completed graduate and doctoral degrees in work based at herrick more than 50 years after its start ray herrick s great grandson kent herrick is working with the herrick faculty on thermal systems research  the herrick foundation also provided one of the earliest gifts a 1 million contribution to this building project the new laboratories contain a truly unique set of facilities for considering the entire spectrum of building activities and technologies in isolation under controlled conditions or integrated in systems under real world conditions braun said no other university has facilities and expertise that cover the scale of activities from individual device to subsystem to whole building and occupant performance   from grant preparation to successful project completion purdue physical facilities coordinated the design

aS' radiant fried chicken patties versus traditional split decision kevin keener a purdue university professor of food science demonstrates the radiant fryer in a campus lab purdue agricultural communication file photo tom campbell  download photo west lafayette ind panelists preferences in a taste test were nearly equally divided between chicken patties fried in a radiant fryer developed by a purdue university researcher and those fried in a conventional oil immersion fryer a purdue study showed  while panelists preferred the flavor and less oily texture of the radiant fried patties they preferred the crispiness and appearance of immersion fried chicken patties  panelists were split on their overall preference 34 favored the radiant fried patty and 33 selected the immersion fried patty  one panelist did not indicate a preference the key is that consumers are showing a willingness to eat food products cooked with a radiant fryer said kevin keener a professor in the department of food science   in some instances they prefer characteristics that the radiant fryer can develop keener and two colleagues developed and patented the radiant frying system in 2007  the radiant fryer uses infrared energy to produce the appealing crispy exterior unique to fried food sixty eight panelists were recruited on the basis of age preference for fried chicken products and a habit of eating fast food at least two times a month  the group consisted of students employees and visitors of the department of food science panelists rated randomly numbered samples of chicken patties on the basis of flavor crispiness oiliness appearance and overall preference  this was the first study to compare the properties and consumer appeal of radiant fried and oil immersion fried chicken patties  it was also the first to use the new pilot scale radiant fryer which has 10 independent radiant heating zones compared with five zones in the previous laboratory model  adjustable halogen emitters heat partially fried food products as they are conveyed through the fryer because the fryer requires no additional oil radiant fried food has less fat and fewer calories than foods finished in an oil bath  the radiant fryer can produce chicken patties with 16 percent less fat and 19 percent more moisture than oil immersion fried patties  along with the health benefits reducing oil cuts down on waste cost and the safety hazards associated with handling hot oil keener said  it also can result in better tasting food when you bite into a fried food about 80 percent of what you taste is oil keener said   the oil masks the flavor when we start removing the oil people are amazed at how much of the underlying product they can taste   forty of the 68 participants rated the radiant fried patties as tastier than oil immersion fried patties keener envisions a radiant fryer product line with flavored foods such as cheddar cheese hash browns and barbeque chicken  designing products specifically for the radiant fryer would ensure more uniform frying results researchers currently are limited to testing foods that have been formulated for an oil immersion fryer  one challenge to the success of the radiant fryer is consumer reaction which can be difficult to predict though the radiant fryer produced chicken patties with equivalent crust thickness to those fried in oil 48 out of 68 panelists rated the oil immersed patties as crispier sending researchers back to fine tune the frying profile and product design   crispiness is a solvable problem said keener we can now go back and make adjustments to these products working with the manufacturers to meet consumers expectations   the results of the preference test suggest that radiant frying could be a viable alternative to oil immersion frying said louis nelson iii lead author of the report   from a statistical standpoint there was no difference in panelists overall preference said nelson a doctoral student in food process engineering  the study is available on the website of the journal lwt food science and technology at http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0023643813001011  it is to be published in a print version in october a video showing the radiant fryer oven in operation can be viewed at http youtu be xrpj4ipibcm louis v nelson iii 1 kevin m keener 2 kaitlin r kaczay 2 preetha banerjee 2 jean l jensen 2 andrea liceaga 2 1 dept of agricultural and biological engineering purdue university west lafayette indiana usa with limited success numerous attempts have been made to reduce the fat content of oil immersion fried foods while maintaining their unique characteristics  a recent advancement in frying is dynamic radiant frying radiant frying utilizes infrared energy to reproduce the heating profile generated during oil immersion frying without oil immersion the result being a fried food with a crispy surface and similar temperature profile to immersion fried with significantly less oil  the goal of this study was to compare frozen consumer ready chicken patties fried using the fryless 100 k radiant fryer and oil immersion frying respectively  properties compared included core and surface temperatures oil content moisture content color and peak shear force significant differences p 0 01 were observed in color oil content and moisture content  radiant fried patties were slightly lighter in color and had an average of 16 less oil and 19 more moisture than the immersion fried  sensory evaluation revealed that panelists preferred the flavor and less oily mouthfeel of the radiant fried patties but preferred the crispness and appearance of the immersion fried patties  panelists indicated no difference in overall preference signifying that radiant frying may serve as a viable alternative to oil immersion frying of some chicken products  '

aS' research could lead to better tasting tomatoes other benefits west lafayette ind some compounds that determine plant species characteristics such as the taste of tomatoes can be engineered to produce larger quantities in plants that have few or none of them researchers at purdue university have found  tomatoes available in the northern states typically are grown in warmer climates such as in florida california and mexico and harvested immature and still green so that they can ripen during or after shipment  but picking them before they are ripe affects their flavor which has led to complaints from consumers the research ultimately could lead to a variety of uses such as in improving the taste of fruits including fresh market tomatoes in increasing the resistance of plants against pests or diseases or in producing certain flavors fragrances and pharmaceuticals said natalia dudareva distinguished professor of biochemistry  the research involving metabolic engineering also was conducted by purdue postdoctoral research associate michael gutensohn with collaborators at the university of michigan and in israel  it was published in the august edition of the plant journal as the cover story terpenes a class of volatile compounds are important because they often determine how fruits taste how the flowers of a plant smell thus attracting pollinators and what characteristics plants might have to repel or defend themselves against pests  the goal in the research was to determine how metabolic engineering can be used to produce large quantities of monoterpenes a particular group of terpenes to improve taste and aromatic qualities of fruits  the researchers at purdue used tomato fruits for their metabolic engineering studies to increase production of monoterpenes tomatoes are an ideal system for this research because during ripening they accumulate large amounts of carotenoids the red pigment giving these fruits their characteristic color  carotenoids and terpenes are made from the same molecular building blocks which allowed the researchers to tap into the pool of building blocks naturally available in tomato fruits and then engineer the production of monoterpenes  the researchers learned that the largest quantities of monoterpenes were obtained through the combination of two enzymatic steps  in the first step two of the available molecular building blocks are fused together to build an intermediate product in the second step the chemical structure of this intermediate is further modified leading to the formation of monoterpenes  the research was funded by grants from the agricultural and food research initiative of the u s department of agriculture and the united states israel binational agricultural research

the precursor of most monoterpenes is synthesized in plastids from dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate by gpp synthases gppss  in heterodimeric gppss a noncatalytic small subunit gpps ssu interacts with a catalytic large subunit such as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and determines its product specificity  here snapdragon antirrhinum majus gpps ssu was overexpressed in tomato fruits under the control of the fruit ripening specific polygalacturonase promoter to divert the metabolic flux from carotenoid formation toward gpp and monoterpene biosynthesis  transgenic tomato fruits produced monoterpenes including geraniol geranial neral citronellol and citronellal while exhibiting reduced carotenoid content  co expression of the ocimum basilicum geraniol synthase ges gene with snapdragon gpps ssu led to a more than threefold increase in monoterpene formation in tomato fruits relative to the parental ges line indicating that the produced gpp can be used by plastidic monoterpene synthases  coexpression of snapdragon gpps ssu with the o basilicum a zingiberene synthase zis gene encoding a cytosolic terpene synthase that has been shown to possess both sesqui and monoterpene synthase activities resulted in increased levels of zis derived monoterpene products compared to fruits expressing zis alone  these results suggest that re direction of the metabolic flux toward gpp in plastids also increases the cytosolic pool of gpp available for monoterpene synthesis in this compartment via gpp export from plastids  '

aS' researchers discover genes resistant to soybean pathogen west lafayette ind purdue university researchers have identified two genes within the soybean genome that are highly resistant to a soilborne pathogen that causes phytophthora root and stem rot a disease that costs u s  soybean growers more than 250 million annually in lost yield the discovery made by a team of scientists led by jianxin ma and teresa hughes could lead to the development of soybean cultivars better able to withstand the pathogen phytophthora sojae the purdue research was published online by theoretical and applied genetics and is to appear in the journal s november print edition  naturally occurring phytophthora sojae resistance exists in soybean germplasm most previous resistant genes however have lost their ability to fight off the pathogen which has developed immunity to them  together the two newly identified genes appear stronger than most earlier genes and could remain viable for many more years said ma a soybean geneticist in purdue s department of agronomy   these two genes demonstrate resistance to all the predominant isolates of this pathogen found in indiana and many other isolates that are virulent to previously identified resistance genes he said   if these two genes are effectively used in indiana and other midwest soybean crops an annual net increase in soybean production would be anticipated   phytophthora sojae has been a problem for indiana soybean farmers since it was first found in the state in 1948 the pathogen thrives in wet cool conditions and produces spores that move in water and onto soybean roots  diseased roots form lesions that can move up the stem and kill the entire soybean plant the pathogen also produces spores that can remain dormant in soil through the winter and become active when warm weather returns  even in normal crop years phytophthora sojae is responsible for 8 15 percent crop loss nationwide because the soybean plant s own genetic resistance to phytophthora sojae has proven to be the best way to control the pathogen the mapping of the soybean genome in recent years has improved the odds of finding other resistant genes  but the purdue team made its discovery looking for a genetic answer to another soybean problem said hughes a u s department of agriculture plant pathologist and adjunct professor in purdue s department of botany and plant pathology   we were originally looking for possible resistance to asian soybean rust she said our experimental locations had high phytophthora pressure and we found that these genes did very well against that disease  that was our first clue that they might have good resistance to phytophthora sojae during its three years of study the purdue researchers have developed molecular markers identifying tags that can be used to expedite the transfer of the resistant genes to soybean cultivars  that process is known as marker assisted selection there are about 46 000 predicted gene models in what we call the reference soybean genome ma said   these markers allow rapid pyramiding of multiple resistant genes into a single cultivar in order to boost the effectiveness of resistance   although phytophthora sojae eventually could render the two resistant genes ineffective the pathogen itself likely would become much weaker hughes said   every time a pathogen overcomes resistance in its plant host it has to give up something itself she said so if it turns out that in order for the pathogen to overcome this new resistance it ends up having a fitness penalty for instance it can t compete as well or it doesn t survive as long in the soil then these genes will last longer   we believe these genes are durable but we don t know enough about them yet to predict how effective they could be and for how long   ma hughes and collaborating purdue researchers scott abney feng lin meixia zhao jieqing ping austin johnson and biao zhang plan to continue their research  they next hope to move their work from greenhouses and into field trials after that the resistant lines could make their way into commercial cultivars   this has the potential to provide a higher profit margin for soybean farmers as well as reducing the use of harmful chemicals and promoting a cleaner environment ma said  the theoretical and applied genetics paper molecular mapping of two genes conferring resistance to phytophthora sojae in a soybean landrace pi 567139b can be viewed at http link springer com content pdf 10 1007 2fs00122 013 2127 4 pdf molecular mapping of two genes conferring resistance to phytophthora sojae in a soybean landrace pi 567139b phytophthora root and stem rot prr caused by the soil borne oomycete pathogen phytophthora sojae is one of the most destructive diseases of soybean  prr can be effectively controlled by race specific genes conferring resistance to p sojae rps however the rps genes are usually non durable as populations of p  sojae are highly diverse and quick to adapt and can be overcome 8 15 years after deployment thus it is important to identify novel rps genes for development of resistant soybean cultivars  pi 567139b is a soybean landrace carrying excellent resistance to nearly all predominant p sojae races in indiana a mapping population consisting of 245 f2 individuals and 403 f2 3 families was developed from a cross between pi 567139b and the susceptible cultivar williams and used to dissect the resistance carried by pi 567139b  we found that the resistance in pi 567139b was conferred by two independent rps genes designated rpsun1 and rpsun2 the former was mapped to a 6 5 cm region between ssr markers satt159 and barcsoyssr_03_0250 that spans the rps1 locus on chromosome 3 while the latter was mapped to a 3 0 cm region between barcsoyssr_16_1275 and sat_144 approximately 3 0 3 4 cm upstream of rps2 on chromosome 16  according to the williams 82 reference genome sequence both regions are highly enriched with nbs lrr genes marker assisted resistance spectrum analyses of these genes with 16 isolates of p  sojae in combination with the mapping results suggested that rpsun1 was likely to be a novel allele at the rps1 locus while rpsun2 was more likely to be a novel rps gene  '

aS' signature of long sought particle that could revolutionize quantum computing seen by purdue physicist signature of long sought particle that could revolutionize quantum computing seen by purdue physicist west lafayette ind a purdue university physicist has observed evidence of long sought majorana fermions special particles that could unleash the potential of fault tolerant quantum computing  leonid rokhinson an associate professor of physics led a team that is the first to successfully demonstrate the fractional a c  josephson effect which is a signature of the particles the search for this particle is for condensed matter physicists what the higgs boson search was for high energy particle physicists rokhinson said   it is a very peculiar object because it is a fermion yet it is its own antiparticle with zero mass and zero charge the pursuit of majorana fermions is driven by their potential to encode quantum information in a way that solves a problem dogging quantum computing  the current carriers of quantum bits the basic unit of information in quantum computing are delicate and easily destroyed by small disturbances from the local environment  information stored through majorana fermions could be protected from such perturbances resulting in a much more resilient quantum bit and fault tolerant quantum computing he said   information could be stored not in the individual particles but in their relative configuration so that if one particle is pushed a little by a local force it doesn t matter rokhinson said   as long as that local noise is not so strong that it alters the overall configuration of a group of particles the information is retained  it offers an entirely new way of dealing with information majorana fermions also have the unique ability to retain a history of their interactions that can be used to encode quantum information he said   other particles are interchangeable and if two electrons trade places it is as if nothing had happened but when you swap two majorana fermions it leaves a mark by altering their quantum mechanical state rokhinson said   this change in state is like a passport book full of stamps and provides a record of exactly how the particle arrived at its current destination   rokhinson observed a variation of the josephson effect that is a unique signature of majorana fermions the effect describes the way an electrical current traveling between two superconductors oscillates at a frequency that depends on the applied voltage  the reverse also is true an oscillating current generates specific voltage proportional to the frequency in the presence of majorana fermions the frequency voltage relationship should change by a factor of two in what is called the fractional a c  josephson effect he said rokhinson used a one dimensional semiconductor coupled to a superconductor to create a hybrid nanowire in which majorana particles are predicted to form at the ends  when alternating current is applied through a set of two such wires a specific voltage is generated across the device which rokhinson measured  as a magnetic field was applied and varied from weak to strong the resulting steps in voltage became twice as tall a signature of the formation of majorana particles he said  victor yakovenko a professor of physics at the university of maryland was one of the first theorists to predict the fractional a c  josephson effect the effect is very unusual and is specific to majorana particles which makes this observation more definitive than signatures obtained through other approaches he said   majorana particles are the only particle that can produce this effect and experimental observation of it is a tremendous breakthrough yakovenko said   of course it will take time and independent confirmation to firmly establish it but this is very exciting the observation of this special state does not mean fault tolerant quantum computing will happen any time soon if at all yakovenko said   whether or not these particles will work for quantum computing has yet to be seen but in the process of trying we will learn a lot of unknown quantum physics he said   this could open the door to a whole new field of the topological effects of quantum mechanics a paper detailing the work will be published in the next issue of the journal nature physics and is currently available online co authors include xinyu liu and jacek furdyna of the university of notre dame who designed the material specifically for these experiments  furdyna also has an honorary degree from purdue the work was partially supported by grants from the army research office and the national science foundation  rokhinson next plans to perform follow up experiments and to modify the system to probe different properties of the observed state  the fractional ac josephson effect in a semiconductor superconductor nanowire as a signature of majorana particles topological superconductors that support majorana fermions have been predicted when one dimensional semiconducting wires are coupled to a superconductor  such excitations are expected to exhibit non abelian statistics and can be used to realize quantum gates that are topologically protected from local sources of decoherence  here we report the observation of the fractional a c josephson effect in a hybrid semiconductor superconductor insb nb nanowire junction a hallmark of topological matter  when the junction is irradiated with a radio frequency f0 in the absence of an external magnetic field quantized voltage steps shapiro steps with a height 8710 v hf 0 2e are observed as is expected for conventional superconductor junctions where the supercurrent is carried by charge 2e cooper pairs  at high magnetic fields the height of the first shapiro step is doubled to hf0 e suggesting that the supercurrent is carried by charge e quasiparticles  this is a unique signature of the majorana fermions predicted almost 80 years ago '

aS' simulations aiding study of earthquake dampers for structures earthquake engineering researches at the harbin institute of technology in china work to set up a structure on a shake table for experiments to study the effects of earthquakes  purdue university civil engineering students are working with counterparts at the institute to study the reliability of models for testing a type of powerful damping system that might be installed in buildings and bridges to reduce structural damage and injuries during earthquakes   photo courtesy of harbin institute of technology download photo west lafayette ind researchers have demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of real time hybrid simulation for testing a type of powerful damping system that might be installed in buildings and bridges to reduce structural damage and injuries during earthquakes  the magnetorheological fluid dampers are shock absorbing devices containing a liquid that becomes far more viscous when a magnetic field is applied   it normally feels like a thick fluid but when you apply a magnetic field it transforms into a peanut butter consistency which makes it generate larger forces when pushed through a small orifice said shirley dyke a professor of mechanical engineering and civil engineering at purdue university  this dramatic increase in viscosity enables the devices to exert powerful forces and to modify a building s stiffness in response to motion during an earthquake  the magnetorheological fluid dampers or mr dampers have seen limited commercial use and are not yet being used routinely in structures  research led by dyke and doctoral students gaby ou and ali ozdagli has now shown real time hybrid simulations are reliable in studying the dampers  the research is affiliated with the national science foundation s george e brown jr network for earthquake engineering simulation  nees a shared network of laboratories based at purdue dyke and her students are working with researchers at the harbin institute of technology in china home to one of only a few large scale shake table facilities in the world  findings will be discussed during the nees quake summit 2013 on aug 7 8 in reno a research paper also was presented in may during a meeting in italy related to a consortium called series seismic engineering research infrastructures for european synergies  the paper was authored by ou dyke ozdagli and researchers bin wu and bo li from the harbin institute the results indicate that the real time hybrid simulation concept can be considered as a reliable and efficient testing method ou said  the simulations are referred to as hybrid because they combine computational models with data from physical tests researchers are able to perform structural tests at slow speed but testing in real time or the actual speed of an earthquake sheds new light on how the mr dampers perform in structures  the real time ability has only recently become feasible due to technological advances in computing sometimes real time testing is necessary and that s where we focus our efforts said dyke who organized a workshop on the subject to be held during the nees meeting in reno   this hybrid approach is taking off lately people are getting very excited about it ozdagli also is presenting related findings next week during the 2013 conference of the asce engineering mechanics institute in evanston ill  the simulations can be performed in conjunction with research using full scale building tests however there are very few large scale facilities in the world and the testing is time consuming and expensive   the real time hybrid simulations allow you to do many tests to prepare for the one test using a full scale facility dyke said   the nice thing is that you can change the numerical model any way you want you can make it a four story structure one day and the next day it s a 10 story structure  you can test an unlimited number of cases with a single physical setup the researchers will present two abstracts during the reno meeting  one focuses on how the simulation method has been improved and the other describes the overall validation of real time hybrid simulations  to prove the reliability of the approach the researchers are comparing pure computational models pure physical shake table tests and then the real time hybrid simulation  research results from this three way comparison are demonstrating that the hybrid simulations are accurate ou has developed a mathematical approach to cancel out noise that makes it difficult to use testing data  she combined mathematical tools for a new integrated control strategy for the hybrid simulation she found that by integrating several techniques in the right mix you can get better performance than in prior tests dyke said   it s a viable method that can be used by other researchers for many different purposes and in many different laboratories dyke said  much of the research is based at purdue s robert l and terry l bowen laboratory for large scale civil engineering research and has been funded by the nsf through nees  a portion is supported by the sohmen fund an endowment established by purdue alumnus anna pao sohmen to facilitate faculty and student exchange with the harbin institute of technology and ningbo university  the fund is managed by international programs at purdue note to journalists information about the nees annual quake summit 2013 is available at http nees org quakesummit2013 an electronic copy of the series research paper is available from emil venere 765 494 4709 venere purdue edu real time hybrid simulation performs substructure test in real time scale and includes rate dependent feature in consideration one major challenge for rths is that it requires accurate and prompt execution of boundary condition that is calculated from numerical substructure  in most cases traditional pid control induces large time lag between desired command and response which may cause system instability and further the failure of the test  many control strategies for servo hydraulic actuator structure system have been proposed recently to compensate such time lag and other system dynamics  this presentation introduces a new integrated control strategy into rths the new proposed algorithm integrates three key control components first a loop shaping feedback control based on h 382 optimization second the kalman filter for feedback estimation and a pure delay feed forward block for control performance enhancement  the combination of the aforementioned blocks provides flexible performance according to different control evaluation criterion riac has been applied for displacement tracking through rths of a 3dof steel structure with equipped magnetorheological mr damper located in harbin china  the experimental components herein is the mr damper attached to a large scale actuator has maximum force capacity of 2000n the numerical substructure is the rest of the steel structure  real time hybrid simulation rths enables physical testing of critical sub structural elements in a cost effective way compared to other existing test methods such as shake table or pseudo dynamic testing  as rths methodologies develop there is still a pressing need to assure growing interest from the civil engineering community seeking validation  to meet community expectations and reveal the feasibility of rths an international multi university research project has been proposed focusing on verification of rths with shake table tests  the development and implementation of the comparison tests comprise the following tasks 1 a 3 6 meters tall three story 3 d steel frame structure with base plan dimension of 1 84 m by 2 04 m located in structural and seismic test center at harbin institute of technology china was selected to be tested on the shake table 2 a 2500 n capacity magneto rheological mr fluid damper was attached to the first floor of the frame as the main energy dissipation device 3 the integrated system was tested on the shake table under various earthquake inputs and analytical simulations were developed for the comparison basis 4 for the rths scheme the system was divided into physical and numerical components  the steel structure was modeled as the numerical substructure whereas the mr damper was chosen as the physical component as it allows test repeatability without compromising system integrity  a 2500 kn capacity actuator is used as the transfer interface between physical and numerical substructure accuracy of numerical models performance of mr damper controllers and data quality of rths are evaluated through comparisons with shake table structural responses  the results indicate that the rths concept can be considered as a reliable and efficient testing method '

aS' students prefer apps to the web when using smartphones west lafayette ind students prefer using apps on their smartphones instead of being pointed to mobile app sites according to a survey of purdue university students  this runs counter to a move toward mobile web development using html 5 by many web developers the study results are being published tuesday sept  25 at the online academic site educause center for applied research the study had 1 566 respondents and a margin of error of 3 3 percent  at issue is whether when looking for information such as wanting to check the weather forecast students go to a weather app or simply use their phone s browser to connect with a weather website  the survey results were clear students want the app for almost every type of use surveyed students prefer to use an app they have installed on their phones the lone exception was for reference information  using the weather example students had a preference for the app by 85 percent versus 8 percent who wanted to use the web the purdue students said native apps are faster and simpler to navigate perceptions that are also true says kyle bowen director of information technology at purdue s informatics group and one of the paper s co authors   they are easier and faster to use but native app programming is new and unfamiliar to most web developers bowen says and trying to cut corners in developing an app such as by using a template tool doesn t help you in the long run   this isn t welcome news for web developers who are part of a national trend toward favoring html 5 built mobile websites over apps  for example a 2011 article in the chronicle of higher education was headlined as mobile devices multiply some colleges turn away from building campus apps  but it s not just universities that are learning this lesson at the techcrunch disrupt conference in september mark zuckerberg said facebook s biggest mistake so far was betting on the html 5 mobile web instead of focusing on native apps purdue has developed seven mobile classroom apps designed to raise student performance through its purdue studio project bowen who leads the project says although he would prefer to develop mobile websites the project team learned early on that students weren t comfortable with them   the first version of our hotseat app had a mobile web interface there was no native app bowen says we discovered that students would go the app store and look for the hotseat app and when it wasn t there they wouldn t use the software on their phone   matthew pistilli a co author on the paper and an academic technologies research scientist at purdue says this information into use preferences is important because there is little doubt that mobile devices are the future for higher education   the advantage of using mobile devices in higher education is that it allows the student to take the classroom almost anywhere pistilli says   for example using an app such as purdue s jetpack or through mobile access to blackboard students can read articles work on assignments or collaborate with others from anywhere   pistilli says there are hidden benefits too because instructors and administrators can learn more about which educational approaches are working through data produced by the apps   analytics collected on application use allow an instructor or institution to do several things such as fine tune the software promote the use of other apps or simply provide information to students about how they can enhance their class performance pistilli says   when asked how to rank their skill level on using the phone from novice only using the phone for calls email and texting to expert having developed mobile apps 85 percent considered themselves either an intermediate 42 percent or advanced 43 percent user   students rely on their devices users describing themselves as novice used their device an average of 2 1 hours per day and expert users are on their device 5 3 hours per day   the most popular operating systems were android used by 43 percent of the students and apple s ios which was used by 40 percent   there are a number of manufacturers building many different android smartphones so apple s iphone is the clear favorite device among our students bowen says   the least popular device was the rim blackberry which was used by 9 percent of the respondents students are aware of data charges and 33 percent say they would never download a video unless connected to a wi fi network  in the debate over native versus neutral what do students prefer is a student s preference for a mobile learning application related to the nature of the information provided or the activity performed  this research bulletin examines a study conducted by purdue university regarding student mobile preferences this study provides insights into how students prefer to consume information on the mobile devices ranging broad categories to coursework specific areas of interest  additionally a brief case study of purdue s own mobile development activities illustrates one example for how this information can be practically applied  the information detailed in this research bulletin is intended to help inform future mobile application development efforts as well as establish expectations for companies with which institutions do business  '

aS' students with disabilities put adaptive lab resources to test during summer program west lafayette ind six college students with disabilities are able to be active members of research teams where laboratory equipment can be adapted and assistive technologies added for their personal mobility and visual or hearing challenges as part of a purdue university summer program   the united states needs more students studying science and engineering and many interested and qualified students are discouraged from the biomedical sciences because of physical challenges in traditional laboratory settings said brad duerstock an associate professor of engineering practice and director of purdue s institute for accessible science   there may not be room to maneuver or lab bench space may be inaccessible to wheelchair users or people with limited vision can t use standard lab equipment such as light microscopes and spectrophotometers  through this program we identify such challenges and then work with the research community to make adjustments so students can pursue an education and careers in science   the ias summer undergraduate research fellowship program which started june 2 and goes through july 28 matches undergraduate students including two from purdue with a researcher and program of their interest  the participating areas of study are animal sciences biological sciences food science biomedical engineering and medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology   the institute provides financial support to the faculty member and assists with addressing any obstacles or providing assistive technologies specific to the students disabilities said susan mendrysa an associate professor of biomedical sciences in the college of veterinary medicine and principal organizer for the summer program   some accommodations we ve made so far include machines labeled with braille printing tactile graph representations of data a voice labeling system for equipment and weight measurement tools that don t just show measurements but also speak them   the institute for accessible science is partnering with the purdue graduate school s summer research opportunities program which is focused on enhancing diversity in science and graduate education  through this partnership the summer research opportunities program coordinates some essential program components such as travel living arrangements and a gre preparation workshop   thanks to them this allows the institute to focus our efforts on addressing the specific accommodations or assistive technologies that are required by an ias fellowship recipient in order for them to have a successful summer research experience said mendrysa who is assistant director of the institute for accessible science  the summer program gives the institute which is in its third year the opportunity to test assistive learning technology for student use  the institute for accessible science is supported by a 2 million grant from the national institute of health director s pathfinder award  the grant awarded in 2011 made it possible for the research team to collect information and study laboratory and research challenges for science students with physical disabilities  this information is often collected through the institute s hub at iashub org the summer program s students also will maintain program blogs that are shared on the site and information that duerstock and his team learn also will be posted and prepared for journal articles and presentations   the goal is for the science community especially at universities and colleges to benefit from what we ve learned so we can encourage more students with disabilities to pursue science careers duerstock said  high school students interest in stem fields is comparable at 18 percent between the disabled and non disabled that interest drops duerstock said for students with disabilities during their college years partly because of few role models in stem fields lack of student research and internship experiences physical challenges to using wet lab facilities and equipment and lack of awareness of where to find more information regarding stem accessibility  in addition to the summer fellowship program the institute for accessible science also created the accessible biomedical immersion laboratory known as aibl which is located in the discovery learning research center  using information from people with disabilities duerstock and his team are redesigning the traditional lab space in this lab the wet lab space and the emergency safety area are reconfigured for people in wheelchairs  other features include a motion activated biohazard bin adjustable height lab table and talking scale and pitcher that can report data for those with visual impairments  duerstock whose academic appointments are in the weldon school of biomedical engineering and school of industrial engineering uses a wheelchair and has limited mobility  his personal experience inspired him to develop new technologies such as the accessscope which is a remote controlled research light microscope for people with limited use of their arms  he also is working on redesigning the micropipette a high precision instrument used for dispensing minute amounts of liquids they also are working with other purdue researchers to assist students with disabilities in the lab using robotic systems   our mission goes beyond just inclusion during education and while at universities we want what we offer to carry over to the industry and professional practice duerstock said   we are providing tools to help people seek employment in science and engineering fields which is necessary for keeping people employed and increasing the number of those with disabilities working in stem fields   '

aS' study chimpanzees eat smart when it comes to mealtime pictured here is a chimpanzee from ngogo in uganda s kibale national park bryce carlson a purdue assistant professor of anthropology who studies primate ecology and nutrition in human evolution found that chimpanzees watch what they eat and when which may show that these primates are giving some thought to the quality of their food  data regarding the chimpanzees and two species of saplings were collected from ngogo carlson s findings are published in the american journal of primatology  photo provided by bryce carlson download photo west lafayette ind chimpanzees watch what they eat and when which may show that these primates are giving some thought to the quality of their food according to purdue university research   there is an association between the time of day primates eat certain resources and the nutritional quality of those resources suggesting consumption may track nutrient content said bryce carlson an assistant professor of anthropology who studies primate ecology and nutrition in human evolution we can t say for sure if chimpanzees are consciously selecting the leaves when nutritional content is greatest but this correlation presents an intriguing hypothesis to explain feeding behavior in this primate species and mechanisms for ingestive behavior in general   the study s results are published in the april american journal of primatology and this work was funded by the national science foundation and l s b  leakey foundation carlson who is a member of purdue s ingestive behavior research center is studying the dietary habits of wild chimpanzees as part of his research on the history of diet in human evolution  these primates which live in forest areas of africa are part of the hominidae family that also includes humans gorillas and orangutans  it is estimated there are 300 000 chimpanzees in the wild chimpanzees whose diet is composed of fruit leaves plant stalks roots insects and other vertebrate animals frequently consume various leaves at the end of the day  other researchers have proposed the animals prefer eating leaves at that time to feel full and facilitate greater nutrient absorption overnight or that this daily eating pattern results from social dynamics where chimpanzees typically spend late afternoons in smaller foraging groups on the ground where these leaves are found  the pterygota mildbraedii is a large tree common throughout the ngogo chimpanzee habitat and it is among the primate s key food sources   photo provided by bryce carlson download photo but we know there is a correlation between nutritional quality and daily feeding patterns for other animals such as domesticated sheep carlson said   so we wanted to take a closer look at chimpanzees by comparing the primates feeding habits to the nutritional composition of these leaves throughout the day   data regarding the chimpanzees and two species of saplings pterygota mildbraedii and celtis africana were collected from ngogo in uganda s kibale national park  the ngogo chimpanzee community is the largest observed in the world more than 180 animals and has been actively studied since 1995  daily feeding observations from 2002 2011 made primarily during the dry season months of june through august of 41 adult male chimpanzees were analyzed for eating patterns  these were compared to nutrition samples from pterygota mildbraedii and celtis africana leaf samples were taken from different saplings and at various feeding times during the day  pterygota mildbraedii is a very large tree common throughout the ngogo chimpanzee habitat the chimpanzees however eat young leaves of the saplings found near the forest floor  this study found that the leaves hemicellulose a more digestible fiber and nonstructural carbohydrates simple sugars and starch increased 15 percent to 100 percent respectively from morning to evening  cellulose and lignin which make the leaves more difficult to digest also decreased by day s end celtis africana is a smaller tree than pterygota the saplings of which contain many thin branches and small leaves the sugars in this plant s leaves were found to double from morning to late afternoon  the celtis africana is a smaller tree common throughout the ngogo chimpanzee habitat and it is among the primate s key food sources   photo provided by bryce carlson download photo if these sugars or total non structural carbohydrates are increasing then the leaves are returning more calories late in the day carlson said   at this time they may taste sweeter and the chimpanzees may then learn and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly we know they use vision texture taste and smell to gauge when to eat fruit so it s understandable to think they may do the same with leaves   questions about what humans are eating today and why are important as our growing world population increasingly struggles with malnutrition tightly linked with quality of life morbidity and mortality carlson said   evolution for any species is related to and even driven by food availability and quality so the more we learn about our long history with food the better able we are to make individual and population level recommendations for consumer behavior today and years to come   other partners that supported this study include purdue s department of anthropology emory university hunter college of the city university of new york and the university of michigan  carlson also collaborated with the ugandan wildlife authority and the ugandan national council for sciences and technology the study co authors are jessica m  rothman an assistant professor of primate ecology at hunter college of the city university of new york and john c mitani the james n  spuhler collegiate professor at the university of michigan note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the american journal of primatology article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service at 765 494 9723 apatterson purdue edu primate feeding behavior varies over long e g  weekly seasonally yearly and short e g hourly scales of times due to changes in resources availability and the nutritional composition of foods  while the factors that affect long term changes in feeding behavior have received considerable attention few data exist regarding what drives variability in feeding behavior over the course of a single day  to address this problem we investigated diurnal variation in chimpanzee feeding on the leaves of two species of saplings pterygota mildbraedii  and celtis africana at ngogo kibale national park uganda specifically we related short term changes in chimpanzee feeding behavior on these leaves to diurnal variation in their nutrition composition  results showed that chimpanzees fed on the leaves of both saplings more in the evening than they did in the morning the nutritional quality of leaves also improved over the

aS' study genome duplication aids plant s survival in saline soils brian dilkes a purdue assistant professor of horticulture and landscape architecture with a plant of the genus arabidopsis purdue agricultural communication photo tom campbell  download photo west lafayette ind having more than two sets of chromosomes can increase a plant s ability to take up nutrients and survive in saline soils a joint study by purdue university and the university of aberdeen shows  researchers found that polyploidy the condition of having more than two genome copies causes the flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana to accumulate a greater amount of potassium in its leaves and demonstrate a higher tolerance to saline environments most flowering plants are diploid having two copies of a genome   polyploidy has an immediate direct influence on the accumulation of required nutrient elements in plant leaves said brian dilkes an assistant professor of horticulture and landscape architecture at purdue this shows how polyploidy can play a role in plant adaptation and may explain why genomes in plants evolve the way they do   dilkes says the altered nutrient uptake observed in a thaliana could hold true for other plant species many crops are already polyploids but we can make use of these findings in a variety of species he said   polyploidy could be used as a tool for expanding the range of current diploid crops for example it opens up a new way of manipulating plants abilities to absorb nutrients and survive in nutrient poor or toxic environments   the sodium resistance of polyploids could make them valuable cultivars in regions with saline soils due to its recurrence throughout plant history polyploidy was long thought to have adaptive benefits  most laboratory studies however found polyploids with four identical genome copies to be equal or weak compared with diploids  dilkes study demonstrates that polyploidy s positive effects depend on the environment in which polyploids are grown the study led by dai yin chao of aberdeen is available on the website of science express at http www sciencexpress org and will appear in a printed publication of science at a later date dilkes and his fellow researchers measured 21 elements in the leaves of diploid and polyploid arabidopsis thaliana specimens from around the world they found that a thaliana tetraploids plants with four identical sets of chromosomes had a distinct nutritional advantage over their diploid counterparts a 32 percent greater potassium concentration in leaves  subsequent testing of tetraploids created in the laboratory confirmed the link between genome duplication and the accumulation of specific elements in leaves   when we took a variety of a thaliana and doubled its genome content we found that the potassium level of the leaves always went up dilkes said  plants with four genome copies also demonstrated a greater survival and reproduction rate than diploid plants when grown in a saline supplemented environment  this could be explained by increased potassium accumulation due to polyploidy previous work has suggested that one of the critical factors in plant tolerance to a saline environment is maintaining a high potassium to sodium ratio dilkes said   the balance of those two elements is extremely important to survival polyploidy s effects also were transmitted across graft unions from the root to the shoot  when diploid a thaliana shoots were grafted onto polyploid roots the leaves showed an increase in potassium accumulation this demonstrates that it is nutrient uptake and trafficking by the root that must be responsible for nutrient concentration in leaves dilkes said   when you have a polyploid root you end up with leaves that contain a higher amount of potassium developing polyploid rootstocks for grafting could be highly valuable dilkes said   you can select a saline tolerant rootstock for a fruit tree and then graft with shoots that have other desirable characteristics   further research is needed to determine the exact mechanism that causes polyploids to accumulate greater amounts of potassium dilkes said  he also is studying whether this change in nutrient accumulation contributes to plant adaptation in the wild which is key to understanding both short and long term evolution of plants  the saline tolerance of a thaliana polyploids could shed light on the survival and expansion of early plant species flowering plants emerged when much of the land mass on earth was covered by a saline desert dilkes said   it s possible that the rapid spread and multiplication of plant species was due to polyploids ability to colonize new highly toxic environments  the findings of this study provide a potential explanation for why we have observed polyploidy recurrently over the history of land plants   the study was funded in part by the u s national institutes of health and the european commission dai yin chao 1 brian

aS' study is mom s favorite child always the same  west lafayette ind similarities in personal values and beliefs between an adult child and an older mother is what keeps that child in favor over the long term and that preference can have practical applications for mother s long term care according to a purdue university study   favoritism matters because it affects adult sibling relationships and caregiving patterns and outcomes for mothers and now we know that who a mother favors is not likely to change said jill suitor professor of sociology who has been studying older parent relationships with adult children for nearly 30 years knowing that favoritism particularly regarding caregiving is relatively stable will be helpful for practitioners when designing arrangements that are going to work best for moms   approximately three quarters of the mothers identified that the child who they favored as their preferred caregiver at the start of the study was the same child they favored seven years later   one of the biggest predictors of who remained the favorite was mother s perception of similarity between herself and her child said megan gilligan an assistant professor in human development and family studies at iowa state university and a former purdue graduate student who is a collaborator on the project   mothers were likely to continue to prefer children who they perceived were similar to them in their beliefs and values as well as to prefer children who had cared for them before   their research co authored with karl pillemer professor of human development in the college of human ecology at cornell university is published in the journal of marriage and family the findings are based on the within family differences study in which data were collected seven years apart from the same 406 mothers ages 65 75  the study is funded by the national institute on aging gender similarity also was a consistent factor to show long term favoritism which is not surprising because the mother daughter connection has been shown in previous research to typically be the strongest closest and most supportive parent child relationship  in addition to looking at the similarity of personal values the researchers also looked at whether a child s financial independence adult roles as a spouse or parent themselves consistent employment and lawful behavior influenced which child remained the favorite  what was surprising is that whether a child was married divorced or achieved independence mattered much less than sharing personal values said suitor who is a member of the center on aging and the life course   these mothers are saying that if i can t make my own decisions involving my life than who can best make these decisions for me  who thinks like i do suitor said who has the same vision in life that i do has a pretty good sense of what i would do this is incredibly important with issues related to caregiving and that is why understanding these family dynamics is so important   while the importance similarity played in explaining why a mother s favorite child remained the same across the study it was much harder to identify what drove changes when a child fell out of favor   one of the few predictors of changes was when children stopped engaging in deviant behaviors such as substance abuse during the seven years and then their mothers were more likely to choose them as the children to whom they were most emotionally close gilligan said  suitor said this is an interesting change because if a child engaged in deviant behaviors seven years ago but then stopped they were even more likely to be chosen than were siblings who never engaged in deviant behaviors   suitor pillemer and gilligan are planning to extend the within family differences study to include interviewing the baby boomers about their own adult children  note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the journal article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu the importance of parental favoritism in childhood and adulthood has been well documented little is known however about changes over time in such within family differentiation  drawing on theories of life course processes and developmental psychology the authors used 7 year panel data collected from 406 older mothers about their relationships with 1 514 adult children to explore patterns of favoritism regarding caregiving and emotional closeness  the findings demonstrated continuity in patterns of mothers favoritism mothers tended to prefer the same children across time particularly regarding preferred caregivers  it was anticipated that children s social structural characteristics similarity to their mothers structural position in the family and support provision to mothers would predict favored child status across time however only similarity and support processes were strong and consistent predictors of change and continuity in patterns of mothers favoritism  '

than those just a few years younger according to new research from purdue university  the sociologists found that people ages 70 85 who regularly volunteered have younger biological profiles than those ages 58 69 who infrequently volunteer  they adjusted for a variety of factors including whether the people in these age groups were in good enough physical health to volunteer   we looked at older adults engaging in a variety of productive activities but there is something really distinctive about volunteering that positively affects a person s physical health said seoyoun pronounced sigh on kim a doctoral student in sociology and gerontology who led the study  the study which is published online in the gerontologist measured physical health and activities such as volunteering caregiving community engagement and employment of independent living people  while there has been research on the positive relationship between volunteering and self reported physical and mental health this study evaluates a specific biomarker that more accurately reflects people s health   we believe we are the first to document this link by measuring chronic inflammation said kenneth f ferraro a purdue distinguished professor of sociology  previous studies look at self reported physician diagnosed diseases self reported health or symptoms which can be influenced by access to health care the researchers said   by using a biomarker which is like a canary in the mine we can clinically detect a person s physiological health whether it has been diagnosed or not ferraro said  the c reactive protein known as crp increases with aging and higher amounts are indicative of health problems such as cardiovascular and chronic disease  this protein was measured in the national social life health and aging project which is a nationally representative sample of adults who answered questions about their health and provided a blood sample  the researchers for this study analyzed data collected in 2005 06 from 1 790 people ages 57 85 they found that crp was about 15 percent lower for people who volunteered several times per year than for those who did not volunteer during the past year   why this effect older adults are either losing or reducing their involvement in highly institutionalized roles such as retirement or their children leaving the home kim said   volunteering allows them to engage in meaningful roles and stay active volunteering helps many people see what is important in life and how fortunate we are ferraro said   having the feeling that you are making difference in a person s life is powerful and our own problems may not seem so important  i also think volunteering is special because one gets to select the nature of volunteering you are not coerced you have some choice in it   the researchers also analyzed if too much volunteering was an issue but they found no negative consequences for those who volunteered the most  crp was lowest among those who volunteered several times per week about 25 percent lower than for those who did not volunteer  the researchers will next examine the mechanisms between volunteering and physical health as well as cultural differences in gerontology we are interested in people living well as they live longer kim said   the relationship between volunteering and inflammation is telling because it s related to their quality of life and disease prevention   the research was supported by the national institute on aging and the national research foundation of korea note to journalists  journalists interested

factors and socioeconomic resources  when specific types of activity were examined volunteering manifested the strongest association with lower levels of inflammation particularly in the 70 group  there was no evidence that frequent engagement in volunteer activity was associated with heightened inflammation implications  productive activities and frequent volunteering in particular may protect

earthquake  the building was among 170 surveyed by civil engineers studying the effects of the january 2010 earthquake such photos and research related information regarding earthquakes are part of a database maintained and serviced by the national science foundation s george e  brown jr network for earthquake engineering simulation nees based at purdue purdue university photo kari t nasi download photo west lafayette ind a new study has found that online tools access to experimental data and other services provided through cyberinfrastructure are helping to accelerate progress in earthquake engineering and science  the research is affiliated with the national science foundation s george e brown jr network for earthquake engineering simulation  nees based at purdue university nees includes 14 laboratories for earthquake engineering and tsunami research tied together with cyberinfrastructure to provide information technology for the network  the cyberinfrastructure includes a centrally maintained web based science gateway called neeshub which houses experimental results and makes them available for reuse by researchers practitioners and educational communities   it s a one stop shopping site for the earthquake engineering community to access really valuable intellectual contributions as well as experimental data generated from projects at the nees sites said thomas hacker an associate professor in the department of computer and information technology at purdue and co leader of information technology for nees   the nees cyberinfrastructure provides critical information technology services in support of earthquake engineering research and helps to accelerate science and engineering progress in a substantial way   findings from a recent study about cyberinfrastructure s impact on the field were detailed in a paper published in a special issue of the journal of structural engineering which coincides with a nees quake summit 2013 on aug  7 8 in reno the paper was authored by hacker rudolf eigenmann a professor in purdue s school of electrical and computer engineering and ellen rathje a professor in the department of civil architectural and environmental engineering at the university of texas austin  a major element of the nees cyberinfrastructure is a project warehouse that provides a place for researchers to upload project data documents papers and dissertations containing important experimental knowledge for the nees community to access   a key factor in our efforts is the very strong involvement of experts in earthquake engineering and civil engineering in every aspect of our it hacker said   the software we develop and services we provide are driven by user requirements prioritized by the community this is an example of a large scale cyberinfrastructure project that is really working to address big data needs and developing technologies and solutions that work today  it s a good example of how cyberinfrastructure can help knit together distributed communities or researchers into something greater than the sum of its parts   the technological elements include high speed networks laptops servers and software he said the sociology includes the software development process the way we gather and prioritize user requirements and needs and our work with user communities  to be successful a cyberinfrastructure effort needs to address both the technology and social elements which has been our approach   the project warehouse and neeshub collects metadata or descriptive information about research needed to ensure that the information can be accessed in the future   say you have an experiment with sensors over a structure to collect data like voltages over time or force displacements over time eigenmann said   what s important for context is not only the data collected but from which sensor when the experiment was conducted where the sensor was placed on the structure  when someone comes along later to reuse the information they need the metadata the resources are curated meaning the data are organized in a fashion that ensures they haven t been modified and are valid for reference in the future  neeshub contains more than 1 6 million project files stored in more than 398 000 project directories and has been shown to have at least 65 000 users over the past year  other metrics information is available at http nees org usage we are seeing continued growth in the number of users rathje said   we are helping to facilitate and enable the discovery process we have earthquake engineering experts and civil engineering experts closely involved with every aspect of our it and cyberinfrastructure and we are constantly getting feedback and prototyping   to help quantify the impact on research projects are ranked by how many times they are downloaded one project alone has had 3 3 million files downloaded   we have a curation dashboard for each project which gives the curation status of the information so that users know whether it s ready to be cited and used hacker said   it s like a permanent identifier that goes with the data set he said it gives you a permanent link to the data nees researchers will continue to study the impact of cyberinfrastructure on engineering and scientific progress   the use and adoption of cybeinfrastructure by a community is a process hacker said at the beginning of the process we can measure the number of visitors and people accessing information  the ultimate impact of the cyberinfrastructure will be reflected in outcomes such as the number of publications that have benefited from using the cyberinfrastructure  it takes several years to follow that process and we are in the middle of that right now but evidence points to a significant impact   note to journalists information about the nees annual quake summit 2013 is available at http nees org quakesummit2013 an electronic copy of the

aS' study teens smoking influenced by older siblings parents lifelong smoking habits mike vuolo a purdue assistant professor of sociology who studies youth behavior and substance use found that teens who smoke are significantly influenced by whether older siblings smoke as well as if their parents smoke now or did in the past  his research was published in the journal pediatrics purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind teens who smoke are significantly influenced by whether older siblings smoke as well as if their parents smoke now or did in the past according to research from purdue university   it s no surprise that the children of heavy smokers smoked but what is surprising is that the rate of teens whose parents started smoking later in life or who had quit or reduced their smoking was just as high if not higher said mike vuolo an assistant professor of sociology who studies youth behavior and substance use   the children of later life smokers were 29 percent more likely to smoke and that number was higher than children of heavy smokers or those whose parents started smoking as teenagers but had quit or reduced their amount   even though these rates are high young teens are more likely to smoke if an older sibling does or if they live with a parent who is a heavy smoker  based on these findings antismoking prevention for youth really needs to target the children of parents who smoked at any time in their life as well as if siblings are smoking   the findings are published in pediatrics and the national institutes of health funded the work the data is based on 214 adults who have been surveyed regularly since 1988 beginning at age 14 in the youth development study  this data covers the adults up to age 38 the 314 children of these adults were ages 11 19 vuolo who led the study also worked with jeremy staff an associate professor of criminology and sociology at penn state university  the youth development study is run by the university of minnesota parents influence on youth smoking is not new but the quality of this data has followed the parents for more than 20 years and shows the history of their smoking patterns specifically length and amount and how that has affected their children vuolo said  most previous research also is based on one time surveys that rely on retrospective feedback from parents because parents smoking could be tracked for 24 years the parents could be separated into four groups non smokers heavy smokers light smokers or those who had quit and late onset smokers who didn t start smoking until early adulthood  eight percent of non smokers children had smoked in the past year and 25 percent the children of heavy smokers at least half a pack a day reported smoking  the data showed that children of parents who started smoking as teenagers and who had quit or reduced their smoking by age 38 smoked at a rate 23 percent and the highest percentage of youth smoking at 29 percent was by children of parents who started smoking later in life in their 20s   the similarities for the three smoking groups were surprising vuolo said i thought the children of smokers who had reduced their smoking or quit would be significantly lower than the other two groups  we controlled for many variables such as socioeconomic status and the relationship between the parent and child but nothing stands out why this is  so we d like to take a closer look at individual specifics did parents smoke in front of children or were children exposed to their efforts to quit  more than half of these parents quit smoking and some of these parents quit smoking when their children were young so how did that influence their children   while the influence of parents smoking history is attention grabbing vuolo said it is important to not overlook the sibling effect  an older sibling who smokes is 15 times more likely to occur in the heavy smoking households than the non smoking households and a younger sibling is six times more likely to smoke if they have an older sibling who smokes   in fact if there was a sibling present in the light smoking or the early onset smoking environment the effect still holds it s just that it s much more likely to happen in the heavy smoking households vuolo said  vuolo plans to continue looking at this topic as well as similar parental influences in alcohol use one aspect to keep in mind is that other research shows that heavy smokers are more likely to have children at younger ages so they may be overrepresented in this population because they have teenagers at age 38 vuolo said   if we did the same analysis 10 years from now when the non smokers children are more likely to be teenagers what would we see   objectives using longitudinal data from the multigenerational youth development study yds this article documents how parents long term smoking trajectories are associated with adolescent children s likelihood of smoking  prospective data from the parents from age 14 38 years enable unique comparisons of the parents and children s smoking behavior as well as that of siblings  methods smoking trajectories are constructed using latent class analysis for original yds cohort n 1010 multigenerational longitudinal data from 214 parents and 314 offspring ages 11 years and older are then analyzed by using logistic regression with cluster corrected standard errors  results four latent smoking trajectories emerged among the original cohort stable nonsmokers 54 percent early onset light smokers who quit reduce 16 percent late onset persistent smokers 14 percent and early onset persistent heavy smokers 16 percent  although eight percent of children of stable nonsmokers smoked in the last year the other groups children had much higher percentages ranging from 23 29 percent  multivariate logistic regression models confirm that these significant differences were robust to the inclusion of myriad child and parent level measures for which child age and grade point average gpa are significant predictors  older sibling smoking however meditated the link between parental heavy smoking and child smoking conclusions even in an era of declining rates of teenage cigarette use in the united states children of current and former smokers face an elevated risk of smoking  prevention efforts to weaker intergenerational associations should consider parents long term cigarette use as well as the smoking behavior of older siblings in the household  '

child it caused sibling tension  however that work focused only on mothers favoritism by looking at both living parents in this recent article the researchers were able to evaluate the consequences of favoritism from both parents  this research is based on the survey data from the within family difference study led by suitor and pillemer to evaluate the role favoritism plays in adult family relationships  the data for the 13 year project were collected in the boston metropolitan area the project is funded by the national institute on aging   the implications of these findings will be important to practitioners pillemer said we often think of the family as a single unit and this reminds us that individual parent and child relationships differ and each family is very complex  favoritism from the father could mean something different than favoritism from the mother we suggest that clinicians who work with families on later life issues be aware of this complexity and look for such types of individual relationships as they advise families on care giving legal and financial issues   the difference in this research could be the result of the role fathers played in this older generation fathers are important figures in families and the father child relationship is sometimes more tenuous than the mother child tie suitor said   mothers are often more open and affectionate with their children whereas fathers have sometimes been found to be more critical leading offspring to be more concerned when fathers favor some children over others   this also could play a role in why daughters experience more tension with their siblings when fathers favor them the gender difference may occur because fathers as other studies have shown often invest more in their sons thus the favoritism shown toward daughters may violate these norms and result in greater sibling tension gilligan said   for these reasons when adult children perceive their fathers as engaging in favoritism there may be greater concern about competition for his affection and support resulting in higher levels of sibling tension   gilligan and suitor also said that these values and norms may have changed since the baby boomer generation suitor pillemer and gilligan plan to extend the present project to include interviewing the baby boomers about their own adult children  suitor and gilligan are members of the center on aging and the life course gilligan will graduate in august and will begin as an assistant professor of human development and family studies at iowa state university  pillemer is the director of the cornell university institute for translational research on aging at cornell university seoyoun kim a purdue graduate student in sociology and a member of the center on aging and the life course also is a co author  note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the journal article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu differential effects of perceptions of mothers and fathers favoritism on sibling tension in adulthood objectives  we examine the differential effects of perceived maternal and paternal favoritism in adulthood on sibling tensions in adulthood  method data used in the analysis were collected from 341 adult children nested within 137 later life families as part of the within family differences study  results adult children s perceptions that their fathers currently favored any offspring in the family predicted reports of tension with their siblings whereas perceptions of mothers favoritism did not  fathers favoritism was a stronger predictor of daughters than sons reports of sibling tension discussion these findings contribute to a growing body of research demonstrating the consequences of parental favoritism in adulthood  equally important they demonstrate that perceptions of fathers current favoritism plays an even greater role in shaping their adult children s sibling relations than do mothers favoritism  '

aS'  super resolution microscope possible for nanostructures a new type of super resolution optical microscopy takes a high resolution image at right of graphite nanoplatelets about 100 nanometers wide  the imaging system called saturated transient absorption microscopy or stam uses a trio of laser beams and represents a practical tool for biomedical and nanotechnology research   weldon school of biomedical engineering purdue university download photo west lafayette ind researchers have found a way to see synthetic nanostructures and molecules using a new type of super resolution optical microscopy that does not require fluorescent dyes representing a practical tool for biomedical and nanotechnology research   super resolution optical microscopy has opened a new window into the nanoscopic world said ji xin cheng an associate professor of biomedical engineering and chemistry at purdue university  conventional optical microscopes can resolve objects no smaller than about 300 nanometers or billionths of a meter a restriction known as the diffraction limit which is defined as half the width of the wavelength of light being used to view the specimen  however researchers want to view molecules such as proteins and lipids as well as synthetic nanostructures like nanotubes which are a few nanometers in diameter  such a capability could bring advances in a diverse range of disciplines from medicine to nanoelectronics cheng said the diffraction limit represents the fundamental limit of optical imaging resolution cheng said   stefan hell at the max planck institute and others have developed super resolution imaging methods that require fluorescent labels  here we demonstrate a new scheme for breaking the diffraction limit in optical imaging of non fluorescent species because it is label free the signal is directly from the object so that we can learn more about the nanostructure   findings are detailed in a research paper that appeared online sunday april 28 in the journal nature photonics the imaging system called saturated transient absorption microscopy  or stam uses a trio of laser beams including a doughnut shaped laser beam that selectively illuminates some molecules but not others  electrons in the atoms of illuminated molecules are kicked temporarily into a higher energy level and are said to be excited while the others remain in their ground state   images are generated using a laser called a probe to compare the contrast between the excited and ground state molecules the researchers demonstrated the technique taking images of graphite nanoplatelets about 100 nanometers wide   it s a proof of concept and has great potential for the study of nanomaterials both natural and synthetic cheng said the doughnut shaped laser excitation technique invented by researcher stefan hell makes it possible to focus on yet smaller objects  researchers hope to improve the imaging system to see objects about 10 nanometers in diameter or about 30 times smaller than possible using conventional optical microscopes   we are not there yet but a few schemes can be applied to further increase the resolution of our system cheng said the paper was co authored by biomedical engineering doctoral student pu wang research scientist mikhail n  slipchenko mechanical engineering doctoral student james mitchell chen yang an assistant professor of physical chemistry at purdue eric o  potma an associate professor of chemistry at the university of california irvine xianfan xu purdue s james j and carol l shuttleworth professor of mechanical engineering and cheng  future research may include work to use lasers with shorter wavelengths of light because the wavelengths are shorter the doughnut hole is smaller possibly allowing researchers to focus on smaller objects  the work will be discussed during the third annual spectroscopic imaging a new window into the unseen world workshop on may 23 and 24 at purdue  the workshop is hosted by the university s weldon school of biomedical engineering more workshop information is available at http www conf purdue edu cheng the research is funded by the national institutes of health national science foundation and the defense advanced research projects agency  note to journalists ji xin cheng s name is pronounced gee shin journalists may obtain a copy of the research paper

microscopy is opening a new window to unveil the unseen details on the nanoscopic scale  current far field super resolution techniques rely on fluorescence as the read out here we demonstrate a scheme for breaking the diffraction limit in far field imaging of non fluorescent species by using spatially controlled saturation of electronic absorption  our method is based on a pump probe process where a modulated pump field perturbs the charge carrier density in a sample thus modulating the transmission of a probe field  a doughnut shape laser beam is then added to transiently saturate the electronic transition in the periphery of the focal volume thus the induced modulation in the sequential probe pulse only occurs at the focal center  by raster scanning the three collinearly aligned beams high speed sub diffraction limited imaging of graphite nano platelets was performed  this technique potentially enables super resolution imaging of nano materials and non fluorescent chromophores which may remain out of reach for fluorescence based methods  '

aS'  temporal cloaking could bring more secure optical communications this diagram depicts the basic operation of a temporal cloak for optical communications that represents a potential tool to thwart would be eavesdroppers and improve security for telecommunications  the signal is modified to have zero intensity when the data are on cloaking the information then the cloak converts the pulses back to a flat signal hiding the fact that any data were transmitted   joseph lukens purdue university download photo west lafayette ind researchers have demonstrated a method for temporal cloaking of optical communications representing a potential tool to thwart would be eavesdroppers and improve security for telecommunications   more work has to be done before this approach finds practical application but it does use technology that could integrate smoothly into the existing telecommunications infrastructure said purdue university graduate student joseph lukens working with andrew weiner the scifres family distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering other researchers in 2012 invented temporal cloaking but it cloaked only a tiny fraction about a 10 000th of a percent of the time available for sending data in optical communications  now the purdue researchers have increased that to about 46 percent potentially making the concept practical for commercial applications  while the previous research in temporal cloaking required the use of a complex ultrafast pulsing femtosecond laser the purdue researchers achieved the feat using off the shelf equipment commonly found in commercial optical communications  findings are detailed in a research paper appearing in the advance online publication of the journal nature at 1 p m eastern time wednesday june 5  the paper was authored by lukens senior research scientist daniel e leaird and weiner the technique works by manipulating the phase or timing of light pulses  the propagation of light can be likened to waves in the ocean if one wave is going up and interacts with another wave that s going down they cancel each other and the light has zero intensity  the phase determines the level of interference between these waves by letting them interfere with each other you are able to make them add up to a one or a zero lukens said   the zero is a hole where there is nothing controlling phase allows the transmission of signals in ones and zeros to send data over optical fibers  a critical piece of hardware is a component called a phase modulator which is commonly found in optical communications to modify signals  in temporal cloaking two phase modulators are used to first create the holes and two more to cover them up making it look as though nothing was done to the signal   it s a potentially higher level of security because it doesn t even look like you are communicating lukens said eavesdroppers won t realize the signal is cloaked because it looks like no signal is being sent   it might be used to prevent communication between people to corrupt their communication links without them knowing he said   and you can turn it on and off so if they suspected something strange was going on you could return it to normal communication   the technique could be improved to increase its operational bandwidth and the percentage of cloaking beyond 46 percent he said  the technology is reminiscent of recent advances in cloaking using new metamaterials assemblies that contain features patterns or elements such as tiny antennas or alternating layers of oxides that enable an unprecedented control of light and that could make possible a cloak of invisibility  the temporal cloaking however does not require metamaterials just commercially available phase modulators and optical fibers  the effect is called temporal cloaking because it hides data being transmitted over time as opposed to spatial cloaking to hide physical objects  the project was supported in part by the national science foundation and the u s naval postgraduate school under the national security science and engineering faculty fellowship program  financial support also came from the u s department of defense through a national defense science and engineering graduate fellowship  note to journalists an electronic copy of the research paper is available by contacting rebecca walton

artificially engineered media with exotic properties including negative refractive index the once fanciful invisibility cloak has now assumed a prominent place in scientific research  by extending these concepts to the temporal domain investigators have recently described a cloak which hides events in time by creating a temporal gap in a probe beam that is subsequently closed up any interaction which takes place during this hole in time is not detected  however these results are limited to isolated events that fill a tiny portion of the temporal period giving a fractional cloaking window of only about 10  4 percent at a repetition rate of 41 kilohertz which is much too low for applications such as optical communications here we demonstrate another technique for temporal cloaking which operates at telecommunication data rates and by exploiting temporal self imaging through the talbot effect hides optical data from a receiver  we succeed in cloaking 46 percent of the entire time axis and conceal pseudorandom digital data at a rate of 12 7 gigabits per second  this potential to cloak real world messages introduces temporal cloaking into the sphere of practical application with immediate ramifications in secure communications  '

aS' testing method promising for spinal cord injuries multiple sclerosis purdue researcher riyi shi is leading work to study the role of a toxin thought to worsen the severity of spinal cord injuries and other nervous system trauma and diseases  the researchers have now adapted a non invasive medical test to measure the toxin in urine samples offering a potential tool to reduce symptoms   purdue university photo michel schweinsberg download photo west lafayette ind a medical test previously developed to measure a toxin found in tobacco smokers has been adapted to measure the same toxin in people suffering from spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis offering a potential tool to reduce symptoms  the toxin called acrolein is produced in the body after nerve cells are injured triggering a cascade of biochemical events thought to worsen the injury s severity  acrolein pronounced a kro le an also may play an important role in multiple sclerosis and other conditions because drugs already exist to reduce the concentration of acrolein in the body being able to detect and measure it non invasively represents a potential treatment advance said riyi shi pronounced ree shee a professor of neuroscience and biomedical engineering in purdue university s department of basic medical sciences college of veterinary medicine  center for paralysis research and weldon school of biomedical engineering if the acrolein level is high it needs to be reduced and we already have effective acrolein removers to do so shi said   reducing or removing acrolein may lessen the severity of symptoms in people who have nerve damage but there has not been a practical way to monitor acrolein levels in nervous system trauma and diseases   the toxin is present in tobacco smoke and air pollutants a method had been developed previously to detect and measure acrolein in the urine of smokers but it has not been used in people suffering from conditions in which the body produces acrolein internally   based on this method it was revealed that acrolein is significantly elevated in smokers and decreases following the cessation of cigarette smoke shi said   however such a method has not been widely used for conditions in which acrolein is elevated due to central nervous system damage or disease   we wanted to see if higher levels of acrolein corresponds to greater severity of spinal cord injury and the answer is yes said shi who is working with bruce cooper director of the metabolite profiling facility in the bindley bioscience center of purdue s discovery park   this means reducing acrolein may help to control symptoms new findings are detailed in a research paper that recently appeared online in the journal of neurotrauma  the paper which also will appear in an upcoming print edition of the journal was authored by doctoral students lingxing zheng jonghyuck park michael walls and melissa tully amber jannasch laboratory manager of the metabolite profiling facility and cooper and shi  the method does not detect acrolein directly but determines the presence of a byproduct or metabolite of acrolein in the urine  the metabolite is a chemical compound called n acetyl s 3 hydroxypropylcysteine or 3 hpma acrolein is very volatile so it doesn t remain stable long enough to monitor but one molecule of acrolein will make one molecule of 3 hpma which is very stable in urine shi said  laboratory rats were injected with different doses of acrolein and findings showed that the detection technique is able to accurately measure these differences in acrolein concentration in the urine  the technique might one day be performed routinely in a doctor s office the non invasive nature of measuring 3 hpma concentrations in urine allows for long term monitoring of acrolein in the same animal and ultimately in human clinical studies shi said  two drugs have been shown to be effective in reducing acrolein levels in the body hydralazine and phenelzine which have been approved by the u s  food and drug administration for hypertension and depression respectively the testing method could be used in conjunction with other measures to test patients for the progress of spinal cord disease   nervous system trauma and diseases are like many other illnesses a disease associated marker can be critical for making a diagnosis a therapeutic selection and a treatment evaluation shi said   therefore determination of acrolein levels gives you more assurance that you have an intense biochemical imbalance and biochemical damage and that you should use an acrolein scavenger as a treatment  we used different levels of hydralazine to see if it causes a dose dependent reduction of 3 hpma and found that in fact it did  this shows that this method is capable of monitoring the decrease of acrolein through treatment with acrolein removing medications   acrolein damages mitochondria which provide energy for cells and in multiple sclerosis compromises the myelin sheath surrounding a nerve cell s axon preventing nerves from properly conducting electrical impulses  the toxin has a possible role in other diseases including alzheimer s disease cancer and atherosclerosis due to widespread involvement of acrolein in the body the benefits of this study have the potential to significantly enhance human health shi said   for example there is evidence that heightened levels of acrolein could diminish an individual s ability to recover fully from stroke and cancer   in laboratory animals hydralazine has been shown to delay onset of multiple sclerosis for several days which could mean several years in humans  tests with animals also suggests the drug could help to reduce the most severe symptoms once the disease has progressed acrolein has been found to be elevated by about 60 percent in the spinal cord tissues of mice with a disease similar to multiple sclerosis  the toxin causes harm by reacting with the proteins and lipids that make up cells including neurons the research is funded by the national institutes of health  previous work was supported with funding from the state of indiana lingxing zheng1 2 jonghyuck park1 2 michael walls1 melissa tully 2 amber jannasch3 bruce cooper3 and riyi shi1 2 acrolein has been suggested to be involved in a variety of pathological conditions  the monitoring of acrolein is of significant importance in delineating the pathogenesis of various diseases aimed at overcoming the reactivity and volatility of acrolein we describe a specific and stable metabolite of acrolein in urine n acetyl s 3 hydroxypropylcysteine 3 hpma as a potential surrogate marker for acrolein quantification  using the lc ms ms method we demonstrated that 3 hpma was significantly elevated in a dose dependent manner when acrolein was injected into rats ip or directly into the spinal cord but not when acrolein scavengers were co incubated with acrolein solution  a non linear mathematic relationship is established between acrolein injected directly into the spinal cord and a correlated dose dependent increase of 3 hpma suggesting the increase of 3 hpma becomes less apparent as the level of injected acrolein increases  the elevation of 3 hpma was further detected in the rat spinal cord injury a pathological condition known to be associated with elevated endogenous acrolein  this finding was further validated by concomitant confirmation of increased acrolein lysine adducts using established dot immunoblotting techniques  the non invasive nature of measuring 3 hpma concentrations in urine allows for long term monitoring of acrolein in the same animal and ultimately in human clinical studies  due to widespread involvement of acrolein in human health the benefits of this study have the potential to significantly enhance human health  '

aS' the pain lingers for white teen girls who are told they are too fat west lafayette ind white teenage girls who are told by their parents or friends that they are too fat have more depressive symptoms when they are young adults according to new research from purdue university   while it s great to see intervention efforts helping young people with physical activity and diet there is a mental health component related to the stigma of obesity that needs to be addressed said sarah a  mustillo an associate professor of sociology who studies obesity in childhood and adolescence if an obese girl was called fat at age 11 or 12 she had more depressive symptoms in her late teens and early 20s compared to obese teens who were not called fat   the effects were small but given the increased risk of depression among women identifying the impact of factors that can be modified is valuable mustillo said   this is a reminder that stigma laden labels are powerful and can influence individual well being for the long term the study which is published in social psychology quarterly followed females from as young as ages 9 and 10 for 10 years starting in 1987 the physical and mental health of 2 379 girls was monitored annually as part of the national growth and health study  data was collected during physical exams nutrition and physical assessments and questionnaires in this sample 8 percent of the white girls and 18 percent of the black girls were obese at baseline  although the black girls in this study reported more fat labeling than the white girls they did not have the same long term effects as the white teenagers   this study doesn t address the causes of the difference but other research suggests that the black community is more accepting of a wider range of body types and sizes and that black teenage girls may have better coping skills mustillo said  the researchers also don t know if the label of too fat was made in a teasing way or meant as a general comment white children who were labeled fat at the younger ages of 9 and 10 experienced increased distress at the time but the effects were short term mustillo said   however if they were called fat as a teenager then they were at risk of depressive symptoms as a young adult identity is more stable in late childhood such as at ages 9 and 10 but those tumultuous early adolescence years are vulnerable to negative perceptions such as the shame self loathing and rejection often associated with obesity  this study suggests those feelings can stick with them mustillo s previous research found that even if obese young women were able to return to the normal weight range in their teen years the negative self perception was still there   again helping young people with obesity needs to go beyond the physical aspect mustillo said according to the centers for disease control and prevention approximately 17 percent or 12 5 million children ages 2 19 are obese  the data set used for this study represents a time when obesity was not as prevalent now we re looking at if and how today s higher prevalence of obesity affects the level of stigma and acceptance mustillo said   another development is the american medical association s identifying obesity as a disease in doing so will this reduce the stigma associated with obesity   this article also was co authored by kristen budd a purdue alumna and now assistant professor at indiana university south bend and kimber hendrix a purdue graduate student in sociology  the data set is from the national heart lung and blood institute note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the journal article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu obesity labeling and psychological distress in late childhood and adolescent black and white girls the distal effects of stigma the stigma of childhood obesity has the potential to affect psychological development during the early life course but few studies examine whether experiencing stigma in childhood and adolescence has lasting ramifications for mental health during the transition to adulthood  integrating modified labeling theory with a life course perspective this study examined how obesity at different ages affects psychological distress in late adolescence using longitudinal data on black and white girls  we tested whether parent or friend labeling mediates this relationship and whether distal effects on psychological distress are further mediated through proximal distress using data from the national growth and health study n 2 379  findings showed significant proximal and distal effects of obesity on psychological distress through both parent and friend labeling among white girls  distal effects on psychological distress were also mediated by proximal psychological distress among black girls there were no distal effects suggesting weight based stigma is more consequential for white girls compared to black girls  '

aS' theory of higgs field earns nobel prize purdue physicists part of experiment that proved it west lafayette ind the 2013 nobel prize in physics on tuesday oct 8 was awarded to fran ois englert and peter higgs for their work in developing the theory of the higgs field and purdue university researchers were part of the international experiment that proved its existence  purdue s particle physics group has been among the team of international scientists working on experiments at the european organization for nuclear research or cern laboratory and the hunt for the higgs boson for more than two decades  in july of 2012 their work culminated in an historical moment when representatives of the international collaboration announced the discovery of the higgs particle which proves the existence of the higgs field   the prediction of the higgs field was fundamental and ahead of its time as it has taken 50 years to prove it said david miller a professor of physics at purdue who was part of the compact muon solenoid or cms experiment at cern   purdue faculty staff and students who had a hand in the discovery of the higgs particle are celebrating this nobel prize and the brilliance of peter higgs and francois englert   david miller a purdue physics professor stands next to the forward silicon pixel detector of the compact muon solenoid detector  miller and purdue s particle physics group were involved in designing and building parts of the detector and analyzing and reviewing data from the experiment   photo courtesy of david miller download photo the higgs field provides the mechanism for how particles get different masses and was one of the last pieces of the standard model of particle physics to be proven experimentally he said  in addition to miller the purdue particle physics group involved in the cms experiment includes physics professors virgil barnes daniela bortoletto laszlo gutay matthew jones norbert neumeister ian shipsey and professor emeritus arthur garfinkel  many purdue graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers also have been involved in the experiment purdue particle physicists have been involved with the cms experiment from concept to building of the detectors to analysis all the way through to the last moments of review before the announcement of the discovery said neumeister who was involved in the internal reviewing process of the analyses that searched for the higgs boson   the particle had been predicted for some time and it is simply amazing that it finally materialized confirming the theory of the higgs field and earning its creators the nobel prize   the discovery of the higgs boson has deep implications for how matter in the universe behaves jones said the discovery of the higgs particle was far more than just adding another particle to our collection he said   for other particles to have to couple with the higgs to gain mass means the higgs field must be permeating all space at all times and is fundamental to space itself   the discovery of the higgs particle showed the higgs field was real and not just a mathematical construct he said particles are like ripples on a lake he said   we throw a rock ripples form and we know that the lake exists the ripples are short lived but we know the lake remains even when it is still  through the large hadron collider we were able to throw a rock big enough to create a ripple the higgs particle that tells us the lake the higgs field is out there   at cern the large hadron collider or lhc crashes protons together at nearly the speed of light to create tiny subatomic particles some of which had never before been seen  the cms is one of three detectors at the lhc capturing traces of these collisions and was used in the experiments that led to the higgs discovery  purdue scientists and students contributed to the design and construction of several key parts of the cms detector the software used to operate it and analyze the collisions and have contributed to a variety of key data measurements  purdue physics professor norbert neumeister stands next to the large hadron collider at cern neumeister and purdue s particle

were involved in the internal reviewing process  neumeister in collaboration with purdue s information technology group also contributes to the global distributed computing system that analyzed data from the experiments  the purdue cms tier 2 data storage and processing center is the largest of its kind among u s universities although the higgs particle was discovered many questions remain neumeister said   the large hadron collider has only run at half of the energy of which it is capable and i look forward to what we will find when it starts up again in 2015  perhaps next we will find something that has not been predicted nearly 2 000 physicists from u s institutions including 89 universities and seven u s  department of energy laboratories participate in the atlas and cms experiments that discovered the higgs boson the discovery was the result of decades of effort by physicists and engineers around the world at the lhc and also at the tevatron accelerator located at

aS' understanding termite digestion could help biofuels insect control west lafayette ind a termite s own biology with help from microorganisms called protists are keys to the insect s digestion of woody material according to a purdue university scientist  michael scharf the o wayne rollins orkin endowed chair in urban entomology studies termite digestion to improve biofuels production and find better ways to control termites  the u s department of agriculture estimates the cost of controlling termites and repairing damaged homes is 2 billion each year in the united states  much of the study on how termites break down woody materials which focused on the symbiotic relationship between the insect and the bacteria living in its gut found that bacteria apparently have little if anything to do with termite digestion  scharf and collaborators at the university of florida wanted to see how diet affected those bacteria if the bacteria play a role in digestion the type of materials the insect eats should affect the composition of the bacterial community living in the termite gut  more than 4 500 different species of bacteria were cataloged in termite guts when multiple colonies of termites were independently fed diets of wood or paper however those bacteria were unaffected   you would think diet would cause huge ecological shifts in bacterial communities but it didn t we didn t detect any statistical differences scharf said  what they did see were far more significant changes in gene expression in the termites and the protists that live in the insects guts along with the bacteria   the bacteria communities seem very stable but the host and the protozoa gene expression are changing a lot based on diet scharf said  the scientists looked at 10 000 gene sequences from the termites and protists to determine which genes were expressed based on differing diets  termites and protists fed woody and lignin rich diets changed expression of about 500 genes leading scharf to believe those genes might be important for breaking down lignin a rigid material in plant cell walls that isn t easily broken down when making biofuels  understanding which genes are involved in digestion should help researchers track down the enzymes that actually break down woody materials in termite digestion  those enzymes may be tools scientists could use to better break down biomass and extract sugars during biofuel production the national science foundation the consortium for plant biotechnology inc  and the u s department of energy funded the research the findings were detailed in three papers published in the journals molecular ecology  insect molecular biology and insect biochemistry and molecular biology the hindgut lumen prokaryotic microbiota of the termite reticulitermes flavipes and its responses to dietary lignocellulose composition drion g boucias yunpeng cai yijun sun verena ulrike lietze ruchira sen rhitoban raychoudhury michael e scharf reticulitermes flavipes  isoptera rhinotermitidae is a highly eusocial insect that thrives on recalcitrant lignocellulosic diets through nutritional symbioses with gut dwelling prokaryotes and eukaryotes  in the r flavipes hindgut there are up to 12 eukaryotic protozoan symbionts the number of prokaryotic symbionts has been estimated in the hundreds  despite its biological relevance this diverse community to date has been investigated only by culture and cloning dependent methods  moreover it is unclear how termite gut microbiomes respond to diet changes and what roles they play in lignocellulose digestion  this study utilized high throughput 454 pyrosequencing of 16s v5 v6 amplicons to sample the hindgut lumen prokaryotic microbiota of r flavipes and to examine compositional changes in response to lignin rich and lignin poor cellulose diets after a 7 day feeding period  of the 126 475 000 high quality reads that were obtained 99 9 were annotated as bacteria and 0 11 as archaea major bacterial phyla included spirochaetes 24 9 elusimicrobia 19 8 firmicutes 17 8 bacteroidetes 14 1 proteobacteria 11 4 fibrobacteres 5 8 verrucomicrobia 2 0 actinobacteria 1 4 and tenericutes 1 3  the r flavipes hindgut lumen prokaryotic microbiota was found to contain over 4 761 species level phylotypes however diet dependent shifts were not statistically significant or uniform across colonies suggesting significant environmental and or host genetic impacts on colony level microbiome composition  these results provide insights into termite gut microbiome diversity and suggest that i the prokaryotic gut microbiota is much more complex than previously estimated and ii environment founding reproductive pair effects and or host genetics influence microbiome composition  comparative metatranscriptomic signatures of wood and paper feeding in the gut of the termite reticulitermes flavipes isoptera rhinotermitidae  termites are highly eusocial insects that thrive on recalcitrant materials like wood and soil and thus play important roles in global carbon recycling and also in damaging wooden structures  termites such as reticulitermes flavipes rhinotermitidae owe their success to their ability to extract nutrients from lignocellulose a major component of wood with the help of gut dwelling symbionts  with the aim to gain new insights into this enzymatic process we provided r flavipes with a complex lignocellulose wood or pure cellulose paper diet and followed the resulting differential gene expression on a custom oligonucleotide microarray platform  we identified a set of expressed sequence tags ests with differential abundance between the two diet treatments and demonstrated the source host symbiont of these genes providing novel information on termite nutritional symbiosis  our results reveal 1 the majority of responsive wood and paper abundant ests are from host and symbionts respectively 2 distinct pathways are associated with lignocellulose and cellulose feeding in both host and symbionts and 3 sets of diet responsive ests encode putative digestive and wood related detoxification enzymes  thus this study illuminates the dynamics of termite nutritional symbiosis and reveals a pool of genes as potential targets for termite control and functional studies of termite symbiont interactions  lignin is a component of plant biomass that presents a significant obstacle to biofuel production it is composed of a highly stable phenylpropanoid matrix that upon degradation releases toxic metabolites  termites have specialized digestive systems that overcome the lignin barrier in wood lignocellulose to efficiently release fermentable simple sugars however how termites specifically degrade lignin and tolerate its toxic byproducts remains unknown  here using the termite reticulitermes flavipes and its symbiotic protozoan gut fauna as a model system we used high throughput roche 454 titanium pyrosequencing and proteomics approaches to i experimentally compare the effects of diets containing varying degrees of lignin complexity on host symbiont digestome composition ii deeply sample host and symbiont lignocellulase diversity and iii identify promising lignocellulase candidates for functional characterization  in addition to revealing over 9 500 differentially expressed transcripts related to a wide range of physiological processes our findings reveal two detoxification enzyme families not generally considered in connection with lignocellulose digestion  aldo keto reductases and catalases recombinant versions of two host enzymes from these enzyme families which apparently play no roles in cellulose or hemicellulose digestion significantly enhance lignocellulose saccharification by cocktails of host and symbiont cellulases  these hypothesis driven results provide important new insights into i dietary lignin as a xenobiotic challenge ii the complex mechanisms used by termites to cope with their lignin rich diets and iii novel lignin targeted enzymatic approaches to enhance biofuel and biomaterial production  '

rottweilers that have lived at least 13 years which is more than 30 percent longer than breed average and equivalent to humans reaching 100   a notable aspect of highly successful aging is the delay or avoidance of diseases such as cancer waters said the exceptionally long lived rottweilers we are studying have figured out how to side step cancer hold it in check  our autopsy studies have shown that although few of these dogs die of cancer more than 90 percent of them are harboring one or more types of cancer at the time of death   through dedicated research the detailed examination of tissues and careful identification of markers circulating in the blood waters and his team hope to discover how they do it so pets and people can walk around with cancer as a nuisance instead of a lethal killer   that s why we have established the longevity biorepository at the center for exceptional longevity studies the world s first collection of serum blood cells dna and autopsy tissues from exceptionally long lived dogs he said   securing biospecimens from the 12 dogs i visit will expand the array of specimens on hand thereby accelerating our progress  waters research on older rottweilers is already opening avenues of inquiry on the aging cancer connection and evaluating the impact of early life choices and interventions on healthy longevity providing a clearer picture of how factors such as response to stress ovaries and obesity impact healthy aging  waters gained these new insights by changing the way aging research is conducted in 2010 our research on aging and healthy longevity broke out of the ivory tower and headed into the living room capitalizing on the opportunity to study first hand some of the oldest living dogs in their homes said waters who is associate director of purdue s center on aging and the life course and professor in the department of veterinary clinical sciences  waters old grey muzzle tour in spring 2010 captured national media attention and fueled his passion for further pursuing this novel research approach   by visiting dogs in their homes we committed ourselves to an essential tenet of discovery there s no substitute for first hand observations he said   whether you are trying to understand how children learn or what it takes to age successfully first hand observations are critical   during each dog visit waters will perform detailed physical and neurological exams collect dna samples and record body measurements  he will also conduct extensive interviews with owners exploring the living environment and learning the things that owners have done to promote their pet s exceptional health   at each stop i m searching for a special kind of information finding the difference that will make a difference in how we and others think about the aging process he said   i m trying to spot the connections that will put us on a surer path to discovery after the home visit urine and blood are collected regularly by the dog s veterinarian and sent to the center for exceptional longevity studies for analysis and specimen banking  the researchers also follow up regularly with owners regarding the dog s activity level pain and cognition waters sees the old grey muzzle tour 2013 as a key element in building research momentum needed to accelerate discovery  in this 150th anniversary of the veterinary profession the old grey muzzle tour serves as an exemplar of the american veterinary medical association s one health initiative championing the kinds of research intended to benefit the health of animals and humans  waters 54 will have his stamina tested by the intensive journey but he is quick to divert attention to the true heroes of the tour   the real heroes of this expedition are those exceptionally long lived cancer resistant rottweilers who are furthering a pet person partnership to beat cancer and uncover the secrets of successful aging he said   after my visit is over i remember each one of them as my teacher in addition to the scientific goals waters hopes to increase public awareness for the need for this brand of connecting research   we have a real opportunity here he said dogs with extreme longevity equivalent to humans who reach 100 years may hold the keys to unlock the mechanisms that connect cancer resistance and successful aging   since 1999 waters research team at the center for exceptional longevity studies has worked to expand the aging research toolkit by studying aging in pet dogs as a model for understanding healthy human longevity  the potential to gain from this research approach along with the center s progress was summarized by waters in a scientific paper commissioned by the national academies of sciences titled aging research 2011 exploring the pet dog paradigm ilar journal 2011  david g bostwick md mba chief scientific officer of aibiotech which is sponsoring the celebration stop march 14 in richmond va   described waters work in the context of research done by other investigators at the intersection of aging and cancer dr waters work with the oldest old pet dogs is educating us challenging the way we think about aging bostwick said   the biogerontology field certainly needs new workhorses to generate and test new hypotheses i m wagering those grey muzzles that he s studying in depth will have some intriguing stories to tell us about how we can age more successfully   as waters prepares to embark on his journey he reflected on the wisdom of the world renowned physicist freeman dyson professor dyson taught us that science flourishes best when it uses freely all the tools at hand unconstrained by preconceived notions of what science ought to be waters said   we see pet dogs as powerful tools to deepen our understanding of the aging process new tools mean new hope hope that the new research can lead to longer healthier lives   requests for information about waters progress during the old grey muzzle tour 2013 should be addressed to cheri suckow 765 775 1007  murphyfoundation gpmcf org the center for exceptional longevity studies of the gerald p murphy cancer foundation seeks to identify important genetic and environmental determinants of healthy longevity and to better understand the complex relationship between aging and cancer  while the scientific community looks for reliable research approaches to verify exciting scientific leads we see enormous value in studying pet dogs living with their owners as a natural aging laboratory  there is a big payoff for validating this kind of innovative thinking an opportunity to promote healthy longevity in both pets and people  the center and its research are supported by p g pet care makers of iams and eukanuba and the rottweiler health foundation

aS' yeast study yields potential for new cholesterol anti fungal drugs while studying a mutant strain of yeast scott briggs at right and paul south may have discovered a new target for drugs that could combat cholesterol or fungal diseases   purdue agricultural communication photo tom campbell download photo west lafayette ind while studying a mutant strain of yeast purdue university researchers may have found a new target for drugs to combat cholesterol and fungal diseases  scott briggs an associate professor of biochemistry and paul south a postdoctoral researcher were looking at how histones the proteins that dna wraps itself around are affected by environmental factors a field called epigenetics  when histones are modified they change how genes are expressed and how cells behave one of the research team s yeast mutants lacks a methyltransferase called set1 which is a protein that modifies histones  in this case the lack of the methyltransferase decreases the amount of ergosterol production ergosterol is the equivalent of human cholesterol and the biological pathways that create ergosterol in yeast and cholesterol in humans are similar with both being essential for cellular membrane formation and integrity   so if we could actually design an inhibitor to this methyltransferase we potentially could have another drug to lower cellular cholesterol or one that could work in conjunction with current cholesterol lowering drugs said briggs whose findings were published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the same yeast mutant with decreased ergosterol production was particularly sensitive to an anti fungal metabolite called brefeldin a a drug primarily used as a research tool to study protein transport in cells   if you don t have this methyltransferase cells grow slower in the presence of this anti fungal metabolite south said that means that a drug that inhibits the methyltransferase could also be used as an anti fungal drug and potentially be used as another tool to fight drug resistant fungal infections   development of new anti fungal drugs could help with difficult to treat fungal infections such as the fungal meningitis outbreak last year from contaminated drugs linked with a massachusetts compounding pharmacy  briggs and south are now studying whether the yeast mutant that is more sensitive to brefeldin a would be more susceptible to other clinically relevant anti fungal drugs  the national institutes of health funded the research south was supported through several purdue university fellowships h3k4 methyltransferase set1 is involved in maintenance of ergosterol homeostasis and resistance to brefeldin a set1 is a conserved histone h3 lysine 4 h3k4 methyltransferase that exists as a multisubunit complex although h3k4 methylation is located on many actively transcribed genes few studies have established a direct connection showing that loss of set1 and h3k4 methylation results in a phenotype caused by disruption of gene expression  in this study we determined that cells lacking set1 or set1 complex members that disrupt h3k4 methylation have a growth defect when grown in the presence of the anti fungal drug brefeldin a bfa indicating that h3k4 methylation is needed for bfa resistance  to determine the role of set1 in bfa resistance we discovered that set1 is important for the expression of genes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway including the rate limiting enzyme hmg coa reductase  consequently deletion of set1 leads to a reduction in hmg coa reductase protein and total cellular ergosterol in addition the lack of set1 results in an increase in the expression of dan1 and pdr11 two genes involved in ergosterol uptake  the increase in expression of uptake genes in set1 cells allows sterols such as cholesterol and ergosterol to be actively taken up under aerobic conditions  interestingly when grown in the presence of ergosterol set1 cells become resistant to bfa indicating that proper ergosterol levels are needed for anti fungal drug resistance  these data show that h3k4 methylation impacts gene expression and output of a biologically and medically relevant pathway and determines why cells lacking h3k4 methylation have anti fungal drug sensitivity '
