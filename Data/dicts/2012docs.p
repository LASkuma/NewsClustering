aS' august rains give relief to indiana drought still far from over west lafayette ind drought continued to ease in southwest indiana in the past week as that area of the state hit hardest by the summer s drought benefited from august rains an update of the u s  drought monitor on thursday aug 23 showed some areas of southwest indiana that had been in exceptional drought the highest level of dryness for several weeks improved to extreme drought still far from full recovery but improving  there was some slight improvement in central indiana which was in less critical levels of dryness from significant rainfall indiana has been getting this month   most of the improvement in the drought status this past week was in the southwest said ken scheeringa associate state climatologist based at purdue university   elsewhere there s not a lot of change from a week ago scheeringa noted that august rainfall to date in indiana has averaged near 3 1 inches 20 percent above normal  since the start of this year state average rainfall is about 20 1 inches rainfall deficits so far range from 5 8 inches across northern indiana to 11 5 inches in the far southwest  the forecast for the remainder of august was for less than normal rainfall but above normal precipitation in the first week of september scheeringa said  temperatures were expected to be above normal through the period the uncertainty of the rainfall pattern in the coming months will be compounded by land falling tropical cyclones and their tracks said dev niyogi state climatologist   another challenge we have is to try to balance the drought designation based on the rains that will occur versus the longer term impacts that are already under way he said  the drought monitor map of indiana is available at http droughtmonitor unl edu dm_state htm in mw weekly gis maps of indiana rainfall can be found at http iclimate org precip images precip asp a compilation of purdue extension drought resources is available at http www purdue edu drought  '

aS' august rains rejuvenate drought stressed soybean crop soybean plants typically are waist high by the end of august but drought limited the height of plants according to shaun casteel an assistant professor of agronomy at purdue  although these plants just west of the purdue campus in tippecanoe county are only knee high to casteel their height doesn t necessarily translate into reduced yields  casteel an extension soybean specialist is optimistic that late season rains could increase yield levels purdue agricultural communication photo tom campbell  download photo west lafayette ind july and august rains have come just in time to preserve some of the yield potential of much of indiana s drought stressed soybean crop and more was on the way as the remnants of hurricane isaac moved north from the gulf coast  while the season long drought has not yet ended rains and a letup in record setting heat have combined to rejuvenate the crop so much that soybean farmers in some areas of the state could still see trend or more normal yields purdue extension agronomist shaun casteel said  but rain from isaac over the long labor day holiday weekend might not be such a good thing for the crop which could be damaged by flooded fields and wind  rainfall amounts were forecast from 2 inches in the far north of the state to 7 5 inches in the south according to the indiana state climate office based at purdue university   we could see some standing water in areas of the state that have been getting rain where soil moisture has been replenished casteel said   soybeans in areas of the state that haven t had much rain can still benefit from this weekend s rain provided it is not excessive   most soybean plants are shorter than normal this year so wind would not be as much of a factor as it would have been in other years  but as soybeans have recovered from drought stress some have elongated internodes or the distance between trifoliate leaves and heavy pod production on the upper two thirds of the plants  those top heavy plants would be most at risk for lodging or stalk damage from strong winds casteel said in its august crop production report the u s  department of agriculture projected that indiana soybean yields would average 37 bushels per acre down 24 percent from the trend prediction of 48 7  but those estimates were based on crop conditions as of aug 1 and if steady rainfall continues casteel said there s a chance growers could make up some of the difference   late july and early august rains have helped soybeans retain pods and more recent rains have helped the plants fill pods casteel said   at this point in the growing season we re keeping an eye on seed size the average size of indiana soybean seeds is 3 000 seeds per pound  but as it rains casteel said that number from this year s drought damaged crop could notch closer to 2 500 per pound short plant sizes have alarmed many growers this season but smaller plants don t necessarily equate to smaller yields   plant stature isn t a driving factor in soybean yields casteel said what s more important is having plenty of leaf area in a more normal crop soybean plants would have 5 6 times as much leaf area as ground area but good yields can be obtained with leaf area that is only four times the ground area   casteel was quick to point out that conditions vary by region the u s drought monitor update of thursday aug 30 for example showed that most of the improvement in conditions was in northeast indiana where the drought was downgraded from severe to moderate the second level of dryness  but some counties in southeast indiana near cincinnati deteriorated to extreme drought the second highest level there really have been three drought scenarios in indiana this year he said   some areas have been dry all season long some were dry early but then had timely rains and other areas started out with rain but dried off late   in the southwestern portion of the state farmers have experienced exceptional drought throughout much of the season and still might not see much potential to preserve yield at this point  in parts of the state that started out dry but then got timely rains soybeans are progressing well this is especially true in the north central and the northeast  the southeast had rain early but then dried off pod retention has been a problem in those areas growers who do have soybeans to harvest will be able to take advantage of extremely high prices  soybean futures for november 2012 and january 2013 are hovering around 17 per bushel that s up nearly 6 per bushel from the november 2011 futures  with prices that high casteel said growers need to be doing yield estimates for grain marketing he also said it s important for farmers to inspect plants for bean leaf beetles  the insect emerged earlier and at higher populations after a mild winter which gave it time to produce a second generation that could now damage soybean yields   we need to be out in the fields looking for bean leaf beetles feeding on pods not leaves he said treatment thresholds are going to be lower this year because soybean prices are so high   more information about estimating soybean yields and bean leaf beetle is available in the aug 24 issue of purdue extension s pest and crop newsletter at http extension entm purdue edu pestcrop 2012 issue22 index html'

purdue is among 10 award winners for 2012 selected out of 354 nominations from higher education institutions worldwide  the winners are highlighted on campustechnology com and will be featured at the magazine s campus technology 2012 conference july 16 19 in boston and in its july print edition  gerry mccartney purdue s vice president for information technology chief information officer and olga oesterle england professor of information technology says it organizations have reached a point where they must become innovators instead of builders and purdue s mobile applications result from that mindset   we have been able to make the transition from builders to innovators at purdue not just because we have many smart and creative people that s true of nearly every university campus but because we ve been able to create an environment focused on innovation mccartney says   for example when we released hotseat our classroom discussion tool we had our own ideas about how a faculty member might use it  but we ve found that faculty are using it to engage students in ways that never occurred to us when people invest their own creativity into a technology to make it better that s a great sign that the technology truly is innovative   hotseat uses student comments and a twitter like forum to enhance classroom discussion suddenly every student can comment in class and may do so without interrupting the lecture s flow  mixable connects students to their classmates by allowing them to create online study groups and share class materials automatically and securely on facebook  doubletake is a mobile video system that allows students to capture share and watch videos from virtually anywhere using their smartphones  the doubletake system also includes a web interface where videos can be uploaded in various formats and shared with others including instructors or the world  kyle bowen director of informatics the it team that created the applications says modern technology including mobile technology and social media is changing how business is done in almost every area   but before now classrooms have not benefited from these changes bowen says through partnering with creative faculty members purdue is developing a portfolio of technologies for classrooms that engage students and contribute to their success  we see this award as validation for the concept of technology s role in the classroom as well as recognition of the innovative work of the team   bowen says purdue is negotiating with mcgraw hill on a licensing agreement to deliver hotseat to the

discuss information provided by detection equipment at an instrumented intersection   the research aims to improve the safety and efficiency of traffic flow purdue news service file photo west lafayette ind purdue university engineers have worked with the city of lafayette ind   to create a new advanced transportation management system a network of sensors computers and software to efficiently control traffic signals and reduce congestion  the system is one of the first deployments in the country of new traffic signal management techniques developed at purdue said darcy bullock a professor of civil engineering and director of the joint transportation research program at purdue it allows engineers to attack traffic jams on two fronts determine more precisely how to adjust the length of green signals to better match traffic volumes and synchronize signals in series on busy roads so that motorists catch green lights in sequence   we have all been at intersections where the green light did not last long enough for all the traffic to pass through and then seen drivers on the opposing side of the intersection get too much green time bullock said   what we are doing enables electronic signal controllers to collect data that can be used to effectively alter this timing to better manage traffic flow   the ultimate goal is to allow the majority of the traveling public to spend less time stopped at a signal when it is red she said   other potential benefits are improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions because less time idling reduces fuel usage and the associated emissions  having fewer starts and stops also reduces fuel consumption and emissions the system is integrated into signal controllers that are widely used at intersections across the country and uses specialized software algorithms  data are displayed on a main computer in the city s traffic center allowing personnel to monitor information and make a change to individual intersection timing   it is like a dashboard for signal systems said neal carboneau implementation manager for the joint transportation research program   you could equate it to the leap from horse drawn carriages to commercial aircraft in the past you had to manually count vehicles and time their progression through the corridors  you d have to come back to the office and do calculations then return to the signal to make adjustments to improve the flows then in order to verify that the changes were effective you would need to go through the same procedure again  as you can imagine it was a very inefficient and time consuming process recent advances in technology including improvements to the reliability and speed of internet access as well as greater computer storage and processing ability have made it practical to use computerized systems that operate signals   induction loops in the pavement near signals indicate that a vehicle is in the turn lane and other locations these loops which are ubiquitous in u s  cities are connected to a computer in a cabinet at each intersection algorithms in the system use mathematical equations and data from the loops and other sensors to determine whether an intersection s traffic volume is exceeding its capacity tracking traffic during each cycle of green amber red  the resulting information is plotted on graphs that show how many vehicles are unable to get through an intersection before the signal turns red  such data enable the system to identify needed changes to signal timing to facilitate the flow of traffic and also to synchronize signals   how often have you driven down a corridor and had it go green green green green bullock asked the answer is not very often  the problem is that until now we have not had good measurement tools needed to create patterns of sequential green signals the system incorporates new traffic signal performance measures criteria based on research on traffic flow that enable computers to identify the need for signal timing optimization  the performance measures were developed at purdue in collaboration with the national cooperative highway research program and the indiana department of transportation  we ve married some theory with new data collection practices performance measures and modern it technology to come up with a better tool for making decisions about signal management bullock said  loop detectors are used in combination with the new algorithms to upgrade standard electronic controllers the brains of traffic signal systems at intersections   the system has been installed and is operational but since it is the first of its kind getting it to be fully functional will take some time said fred koning foreman in the lafayette traffic department  having a centralized system is helpful in troubleshooting the network which is made up of numerous signals and computers and a web of electrical cables and sensors koning said   several other states and local agencies across the country are considering modeling their system specifications based upon the system in lafayette carboneau said  the project has involved about a dozen purdue faculty staff and students from the school of civil engineering the indiana local technical assistance program supports research and helps transfer technology from research to implementation in line with purdue s strategic plan for discovery with delivery carboneau said   they were integral in their support of the research and facilitation of the dialogue between the city industry and purdue assisting in the system s development and operation   jay grossman a project engineer and others from elkhart county ind assisted the research and provided guidance in the development of specifications used in the procurement of the system  elhart county is in the process of bringing a similar system online recently receiving a merit award for the new system from the american council of engineering companies were miller koning and thomas vandenberg from the engineering firm butler fairman and seufert inc  previous research has been funded by the indiana department of transportation a portion of that earlier work on state road 37 in noblesville ind   yielded data indicating a potential 20 percent decrease in travel time for drivers findings from a recent report about the noblesville research show that optimizing signal timing resulted in an estimated annual cost savings of 472 817 with a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 197 tons per year showing the financial and environmental benefits of using systems and processes such as these   not only are there benefits in improving he efficiency of the local agency s personnel but there are also benefits that decrease the travel time vehicle cost and emissions of the traveling public carboneau said   '

aS' corn silage could salvage some value for drought damaged crop west lafayette ind farmers with drought damaged cornfields could consider harvesting the crop for livestock feed to salvage some of its value and to help livestock producers supplement short forage supplies says a purdue extension forage specialist  damaged corn can be harvested as either whole plant silage or green chop but either way growers and livestock producers need to be aware of how it can affect feed quality and animal health   feeding value of drought stressed corn is influenced by several factors but in general is higher than expected keith johnson said   most studies indicate feed value of drought stressed corn to be 80 100 percent that of normal silage purdue university studies showed little or no difference in feedlot gain or milk production when beef and dairy cattle were fed normal or stressed corn silage  but as a rule johnson said drought stressed corn will have slightly more fiber and less energy but 1 2 percent more protein than normal silage   ideally the crop should contain 60 70 percent moisture at harvest johnson said for upright silos to avoid seepage growers should harvest at 60 65 percent whereas for bunker silos harvesting at 65 70 percent moisture will result in better packing and storage qualities   he said producers often tend to harvest the damaged crop too soon meaning silage has too much moisture which can result in poor fermentation and ultimately lower feed value  stalks of plants with brown leaves and stalks with small ears or little grain content will be higher in moisture a quick way to determine if the plant contains too much moisture is to hand squeeze a representative sample collected from the forage chopper johnson said   if water drips from the squeezed sample the corn is too wet for ideal fermentation livestock producers using drought damaged corn for silage need to make sure they have the feed tested for nitrate  nitrate levels can be higher in drought damaged corn while the potential for nitrate toxicity after fermentation is recuded johnson said it s still a good idea to have the feed analyzed  producers with short pasture and stored feed supplies might also consider harvesting drought damaged corn as green chop there are two major concerns with this practice johnson said   one is the potential for nitrate toxicity and the second is the potential to founder animals animals with founder or laminitis have an inflammation of the soft tissue around the hoof bone that can cause permanent damage to the foot   feed green chop in small quantities throughout the day rather than large quantities once per day take extra precautions during the first 2 3 days following rain because nitrate levels tend to increase during this period   as plants mature nitrate levels decline so animals become acclimated and the chances for toxicity decrease over time johnson said  corn growers looking to sell drought damaged corn for silage and livestock producers looking to purchase it need to understand how to properly price the crop  because yield varies widely based on moisture content johnson said moisture content will greatly affect pricing before growers make any decisions about what to do with drought damaged corn johnson said it is imperative that they check with crop insurance agents so the crop can be appraised for damage prior to harvest  he also noted that herbicides and insecticides applied to the corn crop throughout the season have feeding restrictions growers need to pay close attention to herbicide and insecticide labels and be in touch with chemical suppliers to make sure the crop is harvested and fed safely  more information also is available in johnson s web based publication drought damaged corn as livestock feed available for free at http www ansc purdue edu beef hendrix droughtdamagedcorn html more information about the drought is available at purdue extension s website http www purdue edu drought writer jennifer stewart 765 494 6682 jsstewar purdue edusource keith johnson 765 494 4800 johnsonk purdue edu  '

aS' cover crops help retain nitrate prepare for future crops west lafayette ind drought decimated corn crops are likely to leave residual nitrate in soils after harvest making this year ideal for farmers to plant cover crops says a purdue extension agronomist  cover crops can scavenge residual nitrate and recycle it through biomass the process helps reduce nutrient loss through leaching and runoff and makes some of those nutrients available for the next cash crop   this year is a great example of when a cover crop is needed to trap the much larger amount of residual nitrate that will be present after the poor corn crop said eileen kladivko purdue university professor of agronomy   farmers who lose residual nitrogen also are losing the opportunity to trap that nitrogen and keep it in their fields for subsequent crop use   according to kladivko cover crops will benefit individual farms by building soil organic matter and potentially reducing next year s nitrogen application  the practice also benefits regional water quality although much of the midwest is still in drought rain has returned to many areas  with rainfall residual nitrate will leach out the bottom of the root zone along with other essential nutrients those nutrients end up in local waters and eventually in the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico  kladivko expects the amounts of nitrate lost to be much larger than usual this year she said numerous studies have shown the highest nitrate losses in drainage waters following dry years  cover crops also can help farmers recoup part of the nitrogen fertilizer they applied to fields this season and provide benefits for future growing seasons  poor cash crop yields equal less crop residue being returned to the soil cover crops can offset some of that loss by protecting against soil erosion and providing food for soil organisms  as the cover crops decompose during the next year some of the nitrate taken up will be released back into the soil for use by the next cash crop and some nitrate will help build soil organic matter  the amount of nitrate uptake this fall and the amount of release next season depends on several factors such as the amount of residual nitrate in the soil currently the type of cover crop the amount of growth this fall or spring if it s a winter hardy cover crop the stage of cover crop at termination time and the decomposition rate of the cover crop in the spring  while most farmers think of using cover crops after corn they also can be useful after soybeans as with cornfields cover crops can add organic material and trap nitrate released by decomposing soybean residues  although the amount of nitrate taken up by cover crops is difficult to predict kladivko said it could be 50 100 pounds of nitrate per acre in a drought year  the amount released to next year s crop also is hard to predict but it could potentially be up to half of the nitrate in the aboveground biomass if the cover crops are terminated while in the vegetative state and they have a low carbon to nitrogen ratio  kladivko recommended planting cover crops such as oats cereal rye annual ryegrass or oilseed radish if the primary objective is to scavenge nitrate and build organic soil matter  if producers want to do fall grazing she recommended planting turnips or crimson clover mixed with oats and cereal rye whichever cover crop is planted farmers need to plan for their future cash crop in the spring  planning for cover crop termination is essential if the additional crop is to be beneficial and not hinder the planting of the next crop  the midwest cover crops council has additional resources and tools to help farmers select and plant cover crops at their website  http www mccc msu edu '

university alumni and a professor are part of nasa s mars science laboratory mission which early this morning landed the curiosity rover on the planet s surface  purdue alumnus douglas adams nasa s mars science laboratory parachute cognizant engineer helped design build test and deliver the parachute decelerator system on the mars science laboratory or msl spacecraft  testing of the parachute which at 130 pounds is the largest ever used outside earth s atmosphere took place in the world s largest wind tunnel  the tunnel could hold a 737 jet but couldn t quite contain the parachute which peeked out one end of the tunnel adams said being next to something so massive that is moving so quickly gave me an understanding of how an ant must feel when a foot comes to step on it he said   the parachute had to be robust because it faced grueling conditions here on earth a parachute begins to slow an object as it is being deployed but on mars the entry vehicle hardly slowed at all until the parachute fully opened  it had to hold up to a very sudden onset of tremendous force artist s concept of mars science laboratory entry descent and landing   nasa jpl caltech download photo the parachute was designed to generate up to 65 000 pounds of drag force according to nasa s jet propulsion laboratory  adams also helped develop the mortar deployment system which he describes as basically an enormous cannon that shot out the parachute   the mortar had to fire very precisely as the spacecraft traveled at 900 mph and any delay of even a half a second would have had a significant effect on targeting he said   as with many of the various teams hardware and systems for msl if it had failed it could have ended the mission we only had one chance   adams said he nervously watched the data with other scientists at the jet propulsion laboratory during the landing event the tension in the room was palpable as every person there had invested a significant portion of their life in getting curiosity to mars he said   when the sky crane maneuver was completed and we got the tango delta nominal call for touchdown nominal the atmosphere changed to a chaos of jubilation  it was incredible a once in a lifetime experience adams is a low density supersonic decelerator parachute systems engineer and soil moisture active passive dynamics and systems engineer at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif  he earned his bachelor s master s and doctoral degrees at purdue in 1994 1996 and 2001 respectively purdue alumnus eugene bonfiglio a nasa mission design engineer in the entry descent and landing guidance and control system group helped test and prepare the on orbit contingency plan for the msl that would have been enacted if a launch failure left the spacecraft orbiting earth  bonfiglio helped determine ways to control the spacecraft s fall back to earth so that it would have landed safely in the pacific ocean  he also was involved in performing system tests that helped fine tune the software used to control the spacecraft during its entry descent and landing  prior to this mission most of bonfiglio s work was related to trajectory and navigation and involved computer simulations he said he is most looking forward to the measurements from msl s actual entry descent and landing   as hard as we try any testing that we do here on

degree in mechanical engineering in 1996 and a doctoral degree in 2002 in aeronautics and astronautics both from purdue  steve schneider a purdue professor of aeronautics and astronautics evaluated the heat shield that protected the msl spacecraft when it entered the martian atmosphere  the heat shield is the largest ever built for a mars mission schneider was on a review board for the thermal protection system  input from the review led to a change in the heat shield material he said the heat generated on entry depends on the weight of an object relative to its size and this was the largest heaviest probe ever landed on mars schneider said   this heat shield faced a very different scenario from past missions and its engineering was quite complicated this was the first mars mission to use a heat shield made from pica which can handle a much higher temperature than previously used materials   as the msl plowed through the atmosphere of mars which is 100 times thinner than that of earth the heat shield was estimated to reach 2 900 degrees fahrenheit according to the jet propulsion laboratory  the curiosity mars rover will function as a mobile laboratory to investigate the current and past environment of mars gale crater to determine if it is or ever was capable of supporting life  it is equipped with 10 science instruments and a robotic arm that can drill into rocks scoop up soil and deliver samples to internal analytical instruments  more information about the mission is available at http mars jpl nasa gov msl '

aS' cutting livestock greenhouse gases requires effort from rich and poor countries west lafayette ind regulating livestock greenhouse gas emissions could shift livestock production to unregulated less developed countries unless those poorer nations can be enticed to preserve their forested lands according to a purdue university economic study  agriculture and deforestation account for about one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions with methane from livestock production being the most important type of farm related emission  alla golub a purdue research economist at the center for global trade analysis in purdue s department of agricultural economics thomas hertel a purdue distinguished professor of agricultural economics and executive director of the global trade analysis project and benjamin henderson livestock policy officer at food and agriculture organization of united nations modeled policies aimed at reducing emissions from livestock   emissions from agriculture have not gotten as much attention as those from fossil fuels combustion but when the world gets serious about tackling climate policy livestock will be an important part of that discussion hertel said   livestock sectors are the most important contributors to non co2 greenhouse gas emissions and would be seriously affected if a tax or regulations were implemented   their findings with co authors from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations the electric power research institute and ohio state university were published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences they showed that wealthy countries alone would have limited success in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production because it would give poorer countries with greater greenhouse gas emissions intensities an incentive to expand production   in this case we would likely see continued expansion of pasture and cropping area in regions like south america as agriculture encroaches on forested lands golub said   this negates greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the wealthy countries this led golub hertel and their co authors to examine what might happen if emission regulations in wealthy countries were paired with incentives to retain forested land in poorer nations  without new grazing areas those poorer countries would not expand their livestock production as much indeed this combination of policies is quite effective at preventing emissions leakage to developing countries while enhancing forest carbon stocks in the lower income regions hertel said  the effect however would be less meat available for consumption in the poorer countries and a price increase globally just like a fossil fuel emissions tax would raise prices for energy this would have an impact on agricultural prices hertel said  this unwanted impact on livestock consumption and production in poorer countries could be reduced by designing an appropriate policy the authors found  their study shows that wealthier countries could provide a subsidy that requires poorer countries to protect forested lands and shift to cleaner technologies which would support those countries output and consumption while reducing emissions  purdue s global trade analysis project model was used for the study the food and agriculture organization provided funding for the research  alla a golub benjamin b henderson thomas w hertel pierre j gerber steven k rose and brent sohngen recent research has shed light on the cost effective contribution that agriculture can make to global greenhouse gas abatement however the resulting impacts on agricultural production producer livelihoods and food security remain largely unexplored  this paper provides an integrated assessment of the linkages between land based climate policies development and food security with a particular emphasis on abatement opportunities and impacts in the livestock sector  targeting annex i countries and exempting non annex i countries from land based carbon policies on equity or food security grounds may result in significant leakage rates for livestock production and agriculture as a whole  we find that such leakage can be eliminated by supplying forest carbon sequestration incentives to non annex i countries furthermore substantial additional global agricultural abatement can be attained by extending a greenhouse gas emissions tax to non annex i agricultural producers while compensating them for their additional tax expenses  because of their relatively large emissions intensities and limited abatement possibilities ruminant meat producers face the greatest market adjustments to land based climate policies  we also evaluate the impacts of climate policies on livelihoods and food consumption in developing countries in the absence of non annex i abatement policies these impacts are modest  however strong income and food consumption impacts surface because of higher food costs after forest carbon sequestration is promoted at a global scale  food consumption among unskilled labor households falls but rises for the representative farm households because global agricultural supplies are restricted and farm prices rise sharply in the face of inelastic food demands   '

aS' deboer farmland property taxes to continue rising into 2015 west lafayette ind farmland owners are in for more property tax increases at least into 2015 purdue extension agricultural economist larry deboer says  in the jan 27 issue of his column capital comments deboer said the base rate for the assessment of an acre of farmland will jump from 1 290 in 2011 to 1 500 in 2012  he estimates the base rate will be about 2 030 per acre by 2015 the 2007 base rate was 880 indiana farmland is assessed based on its use value rather than its market value a practice not uncommon among other states  for example farmland that borders commercial or residential development is not assessed based on selling price but rather only on the income it can earn from farming deboer said  when determining property taxes the government uses a formula that takes into account the base rate productivity factor and influence factor  the productivity factor is based on soil productivity for growing corn subtracted from that for some acreage is an influence factor which is a percentage reduction in the dollar amount based on conditions such as frequent flooding grade or forest cover  changes in the assessed value come into play because of the way the base rate is calculated each year indiana s assessed values change each year based on several factors including land rents commodity prices costs and interest rates  increasing land rents high commodity prices and low interest rates have combined to create a trend of increase that means the base rate for 2011 was based on figures from the years 2002 07  the base rate for 2012 was calculated from the years 2003 08 because corn and soybean prices in 2002 were relatively low and interest rates were high those numbers combined to help keep the average lower in 2011 s assessments  now the numbers from 2002 have been replaced with the high commodity prices and lower interest rates of 2008 resulting in an increase in assessed value   here s where a new quirk in the formula comes in the department of local government finance drops the highest value of the six from the average deboer said   the general assembly changed the formula for 2011 taxes to make the increases in the base rate a little smaller for 2011 taxes lawmakers dropped the highest value derived from the 2007 data  but because the 2008 data is higher it will be dropped leaving the still high values of 2007 to factor into the 2012 tax assessments   without dropping the highest value the base rate for 2012 taxes would have been 1 670 deboer said the calculation change reduced the base rate by about 10 percent   because there is a four year lag in the formula and all of the data from 2009 and 2010 and most from 2011 are available deboer said it is possible to project what will happen to the base rate for the next few years  the department of local government finance used data from 2004 2009 for the 2013 calculation of 1 630 deboer said because commodity prices have remained high and interest rates low the base rate for taxes in 2014 will be about 1 760  for taxes in 2015 it will be about 2 030 the six year average and four year lag also mean the high commodity prices and low interest rates in 2012 will first enter the tax formula in 2016 and will not drop out until 2022   the base rate is likely to increase and remain high for a long long time deboer said deboer s full column along with the podcast version are available on the web at http www ag purdue edu agcomm pages newscolumns aspx source larry deboer 765 494 4314 ldeboer purdue edu'

aS' digital badges show students skills along with degree passport a new classroom app created by purdue university allows instructors and advisers to give students digital badges to indicate mastery of skills  the application uses mozilla s open badge infrastructure and is available for use by instructors at any institution purdue university image  download photo west lafayette ind digital badges icons that represent academic achievements or skills smaller than a college degree are an increasingly popular way for universities to acknowledge the breadth of student learning  now purdue university has developed a pair of mobile apps that make creating awarding and displaying badges much easier the apps available online are called passport and passport profile a video explaining how passport works is available on youtube kyle bowen director of informatics in information technology at purdue says badges are an exciting new concept that is being adopted across higher education   badges become a way to recognize learning in all of its forms bowen says passport provides a platform for anyone who wants to deliver learning credentials  from creation of the challenge to creating the actual badge image itself and then a way to display earned badges it s all built into the platform   many instructors are moving to new models of instruction and passport is a technology that supports many of those new models  gerry mccartney purdue s vice president for information technology cio and oesterle professor of information technology says digital badges can sometimes provide a better view of a student s academic experience   students learn in many ways and in a variety of settings while attending a university such as purdue mccartney says in addition to formal lectures and homework there is also time spent in labs and doing field work time spent in service projects or internships and experiences they glean from student organizations  the passport app will give interested faculty and advisers another way to recognize and validate those skills for students through their college careers students gain knowledge and skills that may not be well represented in their college degrees  a student may have learned practical skills such as knowing how to write html code have earned a prestigious scholarship or served as an officer in a student organization  digital badges are becoming a popular way to acknowledge professional skills and purdue university has released the passport application to allow instructors to create badges for their students  the creator tool in passport offers a variety of templates on which instructors or advisers can base their own badges purdue university image  download photo badges are currently in use or in development at institutions such as mit carnegie mellon the university of california davis and seton hall  organizations outside of higher education are issuing badges too including nasa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the u s  departments of veterans affairs and education the corporation for public broadcasting and the movie studio disney pixar purdue s passport platform integrates with the popular mozilla open badge infrastructure including mozilla backpack this system developed by the same organization that develops the firefox web browser allows the digital badge to include metadata such as who issued the badge how it was earned and when it was earned users display their badges through the backpack site  mark surman executive director of mozilla says badges empower learners to take charge of their online identities and reputations   we believe digital badges are the next step in unlocking the full educational potential of the web surman says as a nonprofit organization committed to the power of open collaboration and learning we re extremely excited to see purdue take this step  it s a milestone for the entire openbadges project bill watson an assistant professor in purdue s department of curriculum and instruction was instrumental in creating the passport platform and will be using passport in a graduate level course this semester he says the advantage of badges is that they allow faculty to focus on competencies skills and learner performance   typically in courses we have a number of very broad learning goals and grades are given out on student assignments tied to these broad goals watson says   but really it is more a comparison of students rather than a focus on student learning and attainment of desired learning outcomes   badges help instructors encourage students to demonstrate how they have met very specific learning objectives through actual performance   purdue s passport platform consists of two apps the passport app allows instructors to set the steps or challenges a student must achieve to earn the badge  the app also allows an instructor or adviser to create a badge by choosing from several templates the second part of the platform is passport profile  this is an app designed for tablets that allows users to display their badges both passport badges as well as badges from their mozilla backpack we ve created it so that you can easily show the badges and the information behind them while holding the tablet and showing it to someone bowen says   that way you don t have to keep taking the tablet away to navigate through the app you can show the work behind the badge as you speak   bowen says the passport profile app is operated a bit like a guitar a user holds his or her tablet with the screen facing the interviewer and operates tabs along the bottom of the screen as if they were frets on a guitar neck  then the user strums or flicks through screens and images to display his or her portfolio it s designed to work with large gestures so that you don t have to have a good view of it yourself to show off your portfolio bowen says   you don t have to click on small buttons with your fingertip you just make these large gestures that let you move through your presentation   a new ipad app created by purdue university allows users to display professional digital badges the app is part of purdue s passport platform and can display badges from the passport app or from the popular mozilla backpack   purdue university image download photo in addition to displaying passport badges the latest version of passport profile which has been submitted to the apple itunes app store can also display any mozilla open badge  each badge also has a url that users can share on social media sites as we get more users we ll build in a share function bowen says  a sample badge is available at http www openpassport org at the site users can create a passport account or login using their facebook or google credentials  among the first uses of badges at purdue will be for students who have successfully completed courses through nanohub u a collection of short courses in nanotechnology offered online to an international audience  the courses focus on technical subjects in science and engineering upcoming courses for this fall include fundamentals of atomic force microscopy and nanoscale transistors   students who successfully complete the courses based on scores from five weekly exams and the scientific simulation and virtual experimentation homework assignments will receive a badge  students who successfully completed previous purdue nanohub u courses in fundamentals of nanoelectronics have already been given the opportunity to receive passport badges  in the spring of 2013 nanohub u will offer badges for the classes from atoms to materials predictive theory and simulations and thermal energy at the nanoscale   purdue is looking for instructors or institutions that would like to try the beta version of passport as part of its test pilot program   we re looking for up to 200 instructors and up to 10 000 students outside of purdue to test the app bowen says there s no charge for instructors to use the app but we would like feedback on how it was used in the classroom and suggestions on how to improve the application   passport and passport profile are two of six classroom apps created by the purdue studio project the apps can be used by instructors or students to enhance the traditional classroom experience  media contact for mozilla open badges matt thompson

aS' disaster recovery expert on rebuilding 7 years after katrina west lafayette ind friendships and knowing one s neighbors are key to the hurricane katrina communities successfully rebuilding since the 2005 disaster says a purdue university disaster recovery expert   buildings may fall and streets may flood but these social connections survive during these disasters says daniel p aldrich an associate professor of political science and author of the new book building resilience social capital in post disaster recovery   the lesson learned from hurricane katrina is to stockpile friends because people who survive and then return to rebuild their community after a disaster are more likely to do so because of their individual friendships community connections and civic involvement   aldrich s book which will be released later this month by the university of chicago press looks at the role that friendships community relationships and civic participation play when recovering from a disaster  his study of hurricane katrina specifically focuses on the areas of the lower ninth ward and the village de l est both areas have similar poverty levels but the population of the village de l est rebounded and the community rebuilt quickly because of the residents social networks aldrich says   the village de l est is a vietnamese community strongly connected by its faith and strong relationships and after people were evacuated to other states church leaders drove to evacuation sites to meet with community members and share messages and photos between friends that had been dispersed aldrich says   when they returned to their neighborhood it was easy for them to work as a group to petition for the electricity to be restored and begin rebuilding   without these relationships people are not as successful at coordinating efforts and activities to rebuild the community loses its foundation   these social networks are so powerful that they also can have negative effects by influencing the recovery of other areas for example some areas in new orleans with higher civic participation and individual connections were able to mobilize to block temporary housing from being placed in their community   in this case one group s social capital pushed unwanted facilities into the backyards of weaker communities aldrich says aldrich also has studied disaster recovery and community rebuilding following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan the 2004 indian ocean tsunami in tamil nadu the 1923 earthquake in tokyo and the 1995 earthquake in kobe japan  aldrich who was a professor at tulane university when hurricane katrina hit new orleans credits a neighbor with encouraging his family to evacuate as the storm approached  he continues to work with colleagues at louisiana state university to study disaster recovery after the hurricane as well as after the april 2010 oil spill  aldrich and his colleagues are observing high rates of depression domestic violence and divorce as they interview area residents since the gulf spill   '

aS' double crop soybeans struggle to mature could be valuable forage west lafayette ind many of indiana s double crop soybeans will struggle to reach maturity before the first killing freeze meaning the plants could provide another forage option for livestock producers struggling to feed their herds  an early wheat harvest and dry spring weather allowed growers to plant double crop soybeans farther north in the state than what is typical but record setting heat and drought kept the crop from germinating in a timely manner or at all  fields that germinated late aren t likely to reach maturity and could potentially supplement the state s decimated livestock feed resources   soybeans that won t reach physiological maturity before a killing freeze do have value as forage at the proper stage of maturity said keith johnson purdue extension forage specialist   the crop should be harvested as a forage before green leaves begin to yellow johnson recommended harvesting the crop and ensiling it rather than harvesting it as hay  doing so reduces the loss of leaves which are the highest feed quality part of the plant it also lessens the likelihood of rain damage because the crop can be harvested as silage more quickly after cutting it as compared to making the soybean plant as hay   if chopped and ensiled livestock will be less likely to sort out the lower quality stem as compared to when soybeans are made and fed as long stemmed hay johnson said  grazing soybean fields also can be an option but it is more management intensive and comes with risks in my opinion grazing soybean forage is risky because it is difficult to control selective grazing of immature grain johnson said   founder and off feed problems could result if over consumption of the seed occurs growers and livestock producers also need to be aware of any pesticides that were applied to their crops including miticides used more heavily this year to combat spider mite infestation  pesticides have different harvest restrictions and some are not registered for use when soybeans are harvested as a forage crop  double crop soybean growers who don t produce livestock still might have opportunities to sell the ailing crop to local livestock producers  pricing is driven by current alfalfa prices and the soybean crop s forage quality and will depend on who provides the labor and equipment to harvest the crop   if the livestock producer is harvesting the crop the soybean grower would need to subtract out the harvest custom rates from the value of the forage johnson said  growers in much of the southern part of indiana are eligible to carry crop insurance on their double crop soybeans those who do will need to check with their insurance agents to get clearance before cutting the crop for forage   we don t know when that killing freeze will occur until maybe three days beforehand so it s important for growers to alert their crop insurance agents early if they are considering this option he said   '

aS' drought could cost farmers with future delivery contracts west lafayette ind drought conditions could hit indiana farmers in the pocketbook in more ways than one purdue extension agricultural economist chris hurt says  not only could water starved corn and soybean crops produce smaller yields and cut into farmers revenues but they also could force some growers who signed future delivery contracts with grain buyers to buy back some bushels they are unable to supply hurt said   we ve been hearing of producers calling their grain managers and talking with them about the possibilities of dealing with these yield reductions hurt said   right now it s hard to say what will happen because nobody knows where grain prices are going to go with some parts of indiana now nearing a month without significant rainfall and the critical pollination phase of corn either already started or about to begin large crop losses appear likely for some farmers  those losses would be especially painful for farmers who sold a large percentage of their anticipated corn crop this spring in forward cash contracts  in forward contracts producers promise to deliver a specified amount of grain to buyers well before their crops are harvested in turn farmers are guaranteed a set price for their grain even if grain prices fall below that set price before their deliveries are made  farmers face a double whammy if the drought persists hurt said on one hand they could fail to produce enough crop to meet their contractual obligations  on the other they could lose additional revenue if prices rise above their locked in rate hurt gave the example of a farmer who agreed to sell corn at 5 a bushel based on an anticipated production of 150 bushels per acre for 750 in revenue per acre  if drought reduced the farmer s production to 120 bushels per acre and pushed cash prices to 6 a bushel the farmer would deliver that smaller crop at the price agreed upon but then have to pay the buyer for the 30 bushels per acre the farmer was unable to supply  that undeliverable charge would be 30 per acre based on the 1 per bushel more than the contract price the grain is now worth   that 120 bushels delivered would only generate 600 for the farmer hurt said then after the farmer paid the 30 on the non delivered grain they would have only 570 of revenue per acre or 180 per acre less revenue than they had originally planned   first if they have a local buyer a grain elevator processor or local livestock operation they can buy back some of those bushels that have been forward sold he said   probably for most producers at this point they re going to have to pay some difference for those bushels lost but they would avoid further potential losses if prices move even higher   a second common strategy would be to buy futures to offset some of the price impacts buying futures still means they would be committed to deliver the cash position so that doesn t get them out of the need to physically deliver  but it does get them some recovery against even higher prices if prices go higher they could gain on their futures position and those gains could help offset losses on their cash forward contract   hurt said a third strategy is to buy call options contracts that give farmers the right but not the obligation to buy a fixed number of bushels for a specific price by a specific date   the farmer would have to pay a premium for those rights but would have price protection against rising prices hurt said options strategies do not deal with the need to deliver physical bushels they simply are used as a way to potentially generate positive returns if prices rise  these positive returns can then be used to offset some of the negative consequences of the bushels that cannot be delivered at higher prices   hurt urged farmers who are concerned that they have sold more bushels than they might produce to contact their grain buyers and discuss delivery alternatives  not all the news is bad in drought years farmers can still see their revenues increase through what economists call the natural hedge   it s this concept that when a major production state has reduced yields due to something like drought conditions prices generally go higher than yields go down hurt said   so if yield losses for an entire region or a state were 10 percent but prices go up by say 15 or 20 percent actual revenues in a drought year can be higher than in a year when you have normal yields   for example indiana s average corn yield in 2011 was down 7 percent from the previous year but prices were 16 percent higher meaning farmer revenues per acre were higher than in 2010  hurt said if yield losses are widespread enough this year higher prices would help compensate farmers for some of their lost crop  there is another glimmer of hope for farmers with grain left over from the 2011 crop season the longer the drought continues the better the odds that their stored grain will increase in value hurt said  with july corn futures moving prices to about 6 60 to 6 70 a bushel old crop cash corn should push past 7 per bushel hurt said   if we go above 6 75 or 6 80 on july futures then i think we ve got a real shot at retesting the all time highs at around 8   hurt said he talked to one farmer who has 88 000 bushels of old crop corn in storage that s over half a million dollars worth of corn he said  old crop soybeans could hit 15 a bushel and jump to about 16 50 per bushel should weather patterns remain unchanged hurt said   we have a very bullish situation ahead if the drought continues hurt said we could have quite an explosive market but that could all change if we get rain   '

aS' drought season highlights damage caused by nematodes west lafayette ind the drought throughout indiana is intensifying nematode damage in farm fields says a purdue extension nematologist  the needle nematode soybean cyst nematode and lance nematode all are causing more problems for grain farmers in a year when crops already are stressed by extreme heat and lack of rain  jamal faghihi explained that nematodes microscopic roundworms can be found in fields every year but the damage is worse during a drought season   the severity of symptoms shows because of the stress in plants he said farmers should know if they are having nematode problems at this point in the summer   they ve always been there if you looked hard enough faghihi said now you can t miss it the needle nematode exclusively feeds on corn and grasses and is found in sandy soils  the needle nematode often poses a problem in the spring when the weather is cool and wet although the needle nematode is sensitive to heat faghihi speculates that this year the early warm weather created an opportunity for the worm to do its damage early  he advised farmers to inspect the plant roots early in the season for abnormalities which include poor development club shaped roots and damage resembling herbicide injury  the lance nematode is found in corn and soybean fields similar to the needle nematode the lance nematode causes damage to plants that results in yellow stunted growth with abnormal roots  the lance nematode is not deterred by hot weather the soybean cyst nematode attacks soybean plants and causes the plant to become yellow and stunted  this nematode starts as a microscopic worm and ends its one month life cycle as a cyst containing 200 300 eggs earlier in the season the cysts are brown but this time of year they are white or yellow the size of a sugar granule and can be seen by the eye  faghihi said farmers should inspect for the presence of the cysts by digging out the root placing it in water and checking for cysts  the cysts are durable and can survive extreme conditions faghihi said most soybean cyst nematode resistant cultivars contain the same source of resistance pi 88788  nematodes however are overcoming that resistance he said farmers need to understand which resistor is being used in their crops and consider switching to soybeans with another source of resistance  soybeans with resistance derived from peking are something that faghihi said farmers should consider as they determine the best course of action for managing the soybean cyst nematodes  crop rotation is another important step farmers can take to weaken the stability of the nematodes because the worms feed exclusively on specific plants   '

aS' energy dense biofuel from cellulose close to being economical west lafayette ind a new purdue university developed process for creating biofuels has shown potential to be cost effective for production scale opening the door for moving beyond the laboratory setting  a purdue economic analysis shows that the cost of the thermo chemical h2bioil method is competitive when crude oil is about 100 per barrel when using certain energy methods to create hydrogen needed for the process  if a federal carbon tax were implemented the biofuel would become even more economical h2bioil is created when biomass such as switchgrass or corn stover is heated rapidly to about 500 degrees celcius in the presence of pressurized hydrogen  resulting gases are passed over catalysts causing reactions that separate oxygen from carbon molecules making the carbon molecules high in energy content similar to gasoline molecules  the conversion process was created in the lab of rakesh agrawal purdue s winthrop e stone distinguished professor of chemical engineering  he said h2bioil has significant advantages over traditional standalone methods used to create fuels from biomass the process is quite fast and converts entire biomass to liquid fuel agrawal said   as a result the yields are substantially higher once the process is fully developed due to the use of external hydrogen the yield is expected to be two to three times that of the current competing technologies   the economic analysis published in the june issue of biomass conversion and biorefinery shows that the energy source used to create hydrogen for the process makes all the difference when determining whether the biofuel is cost effective  hydrogen processed using natural gas or coal makes the h2bioil cost effective when crude oil is just over 100 per barrel but hydrogen derived from other more expensive energy sources nuclear wind or solar drive up the break even point   we re in the ballpark said wally tyner purdue s james and lois ackerman professor of agricultural economics in the past i have said that for biofuels to be competitive crude prices would need to be at about 120 per barrel  this process looks like it could be competitive when crude is even a little cheaper than that agrawal said he and colleagues fabio ribeiro a purdue professor of chemical engineering and nick delgass purdue s maxine spencer nichols professor of chemical engineering are working to develop catalysts needed for the h2bioil conversion processes  the method s initial implementation has worked on a laboratory scale and is being refined so it would become effective on a commercial scale   this economic analysis shows us that the process is viable on a commercial scale agrawal said we can now go back to the lab and focus on refining and improving the process with confidence   the model tyner used assumed that corn stover switchgrass and miscanthus would be the primary feedstocks the analysis also found that if a federal carbon tax were introduced driving up the cost of coal and natural gas more expensive methods for producing hydrogen would become competitive   if we had a carbon tax in the future the break even prices would be competitive even for nuclear tyner said wind and solar not yet but maybe down the road   the u s department of energy and the air force office of scientific research funded the research agrawal and his collaborators received a u s  patent for the conversion process sources wally tyner 765 494 0199 wtyner purdue edu rakesh agrawal 765 494 2257 agrawalr purdue edu abstract fast pyrolysis based processes can be built on small scale and have higher process carbon and energy efficiency as compared to other options  h2bioil is a novel process based on biomass fast hydropyrolysis and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation hdo and can potentially provide high yields of high energy density liquid fuel at relatively low hydrogen consumption  this paper contains a comprehensive financial analysis of the h2bioil process with hydrogen derived from different sources three different carbon tax scenarios are analyzed no carbon tax 55 metric ton carbon tax and 110 metric ton carbon tax  the break even crude oil price for a delivered biomass cost of 94 metric ton when hydrogen is derived from coal natural gas or nuclear energy ranges from 103 to 116 bbl for no carbon tax and even lower 99 111 bbl for the carbon tax scenarios  this break even crude oil price compares favorably with the literature estimated prices of fuels from alternate biochemical and thermochemical routes  the impact of the chosen carbon tax is found to be limited relative to the impact of the h2 source on the h2bioil break even price  the economic robustness of the processes for hydrogen derived from coal natural gas or nuclear energy is seen by an estimated break even crude oil price of 114 126 bbl when biomass cost is increased to 121 metric ton   '

aS' evidence of life on mars could come from martian moon the image shows the orbits of the martian moons phobos and deimos and the spread of potential particle trajectories from an asteroid impact on mars   purdue university image courtesy of loic chappaz download photo west lafayette ind a mission to a martian moon could return with alien life according to experts at purdue university but don t expect the invasion scenario presented by summer blockbusters like men in black 3 or prometheus   we are talking little green microbes not little green men said jay melosh a distinguished professor of earth atmospheric and planetary sciences and physics and aerospace engineering at purdue   a sample from the moon phobos which is much easier to reach than the red planet itself would almost surely contain martian material blasted off from large asteroid impacts  if life on mars exists or existed within the last 10 million years a mission to phobos could yield our first evidence of life beyond earth   melosh led a team chosen by nasa s planetary protection office to evaluate if a sample from phobos could contain enough recent material from mars to include viable martian organisms  the study was commissioned to prepare for the failed 2011 russian phobos grunt mission but there is continued international interest in a phobos mission he said  it will likely be a recurring topic as nasa reformulates its mars exploration program a phobos mission was discussed at nasa s concepts and approaches for mars exploration workshop and a report issued tuesday stated that the martian moons are important destinations that may provide much of the value of human surface exploration at reduced cost and risk   melosh collaborated with kathleen howell the hsu lo professor of aeronautical and astronautical engineering and graduate students loic chappaz and mar vaquero on the project  the researchers combined their expertise in impact cratering and orbital mechanics to determine how much material was displaced by particular asteroid impacts and whether individual particles would land on phobos the closer of the two martian moons  the team concluded that a 200 gram sample scooped from the surface of phobos could contain on average about one tenth of a milligram of mars surface material launched in the past 10 million years and 50 billion individual particles from mars  the same sample could contain as much as 50 milligrams of mars surface material from the past 3 5 billion years nasa s planetary protection office chose a team of purdue university researchers to evaluate if a sample from the moon phobos could contain enough material from mars to include viable martian organisms  the purdue team stands with an image of possible particle trajectories from an asteroid impact standing from left are professors kathleen howell jay melosh and graduate students loic chappaz and mar vaquero   purdue university photo mark simons download photo the time frames are important because it is thought that after 10 million years of exposure to the high levels of radiation on phobos any biologically active material would be destroyed howell said   of course older martian material would still be rich with information but there would be much less concern about bringing a viable organism back to earth and necessary quarantine measures   when an asteroid hits the surface of a planet it ejects a cone shaped spray of surface material similar to the splash created when someone does a cannonball into a swimming pool  these massive impacts pulverize the surface material and scatter high speed fragments the team calculated that the bulk of the fragments from such a blast on mars would be particles about one thousandth of a millimeter in diameter or 100 times smaller than a grain of sand but similar in size to terrestrial bacteria  the team followed the possible paths the tiny particles could take as they were hurtled from the planet s surface through space examining possible speeds angles of departure and orbital forces  the team plotted more than 10 million trajectories and evaluated which would intercept phobos and where they might land on the moon during its eight hour orbit around mars  the probability of a particle landing on phobos depends primarily on the power of the blast that launched it from the surface chappaz said   it is estimated that during the past 10 million years there have been at least four large impact events powerful enough to launch material into space and we focused on several large craters as possible points of origin he said   it turns out that no matter where phobos is in its orbit it would have captured material from these powerful impact events after the team submitted its report scientists identified a large nearly 60 kilometers in diameter crater on mars  the crater named mojave is estimated to be less than 5 million years old and its existence suggests that there would be an even greater amount of martian material on phobos that could contain viable organisms than estimated melosh said   it is not outside the realm of possibility that a sample could contain a dormant organism that might wake up when exposed to more favorable conditions on earth he said   i participated in a study that found that living microbes can survive launch from impacts on rock and other studies have shown some microscopic organisms can tolerate a lot of cosmic radiation   this possibility has been a consideration for some time and michael crichton s the andromeda strain brought it to public consciousness in 1969  however the movie scenario of a fatal contamination is unlikely melosh said approximately one ton of martian material lands on earth every year he said   there is a lot more swapping back and forth of material within our solar system than people realize in fact we may owe our existence to life on mars   it s difficult to believe there hasn t been life somewhere out there in the vast expanse of space howell said the question is if the timeline overlaps with ours enough for us to recognize it  even if we found no evidence of life in a sample from phobos it would not be a definitive answer to the question of whether or not there was life on mars  there still may have been life that existed too long ago for us to detect it melosh recently presented the team s findings at a joint nasa and european space agency meeting in austria and chappaz will present the data at a meeting on july 14 in mysore india   '

aS' excited about a cloudy future at purdue university and emc bringing massive data storage to students and faculty excited about a cloudy future at purdue university and emc bringing massive data storage to students and faculty west lafayette ind   comedian george carlin famously observed that all you need in life is a place to put your stuff for college students where to put their digital stuff including materials developed through their academic careers their many favorite photos and a multitude of other digital files can be a problem  it s an even bigger problem for researchers and instructors who may have enormous data files that need to be managed curated and analyzed  a new service at purdue however called boilerbackpack will give students faculty and staff 100 gigabytes of personal storage so everyone at purdue will have a large amount of space to store their digital stuff  purdue and emc corp are embarking on a five year relationship that will both address the issue of where students and faculty can put their digital files as well as develop solutions that can be adapted throughout higher education   when we looked to solve our data management and storage issues we wanted to look well beyond current practices and work to develop new solutions that can move science forward and improve student success says gerry mccartney chief information officer faculty member of the college of technology at purdue and the olga oesterle england professor of information technology   emc is the only corporation we talked to that had the capability to both address our current data storage needs and to partner with us to develop new technologies to improve data management   purdue is naming emc as one of its foundational it partners a group that includes intel hp and cisco foundational it partners work with the university in developing new technologies to be used in higher education and scientific discovery  the purdue partnership fits well with emc s goal of transforming it says pat gelsinger president and chief operating officer of emc information infrastructure products   the amount of digital information in the world will grow forty four fold this decade and in some academic disciplines such as bioinformatics datasets have become so large that they defy the ability of conventional forms of information technology to store manage analyze and gather important insights from them gelsinger says   emc s partnership with purdue is designed to advance new technology architectures and algorithms to deal with the challenges of all of this big data   for faculty and students at purdue the most visible and immediate benefit of the agreement will be in place when they return for classes in the fall of 2012 with the launch of the boilerbackpack service  the service will be similar to other popular cloud data services which typically offer between 2 gb to 7gb of free storage like those services backpack will allow students and faculty to sync files access those files from any computer and share files or folders with others  boilerbackpack apps will be available for android smartphones apple iphones and ipads as well as apps for windows and macintosh desktop computers  as with the commercial services boilerbackpack users will be able to purchase additional storage space if needed and the university is exploring ways to allow students to continue to use the service after they graduate   we ll announce specific details of the service as it launches in august but we re pleased to offer our students and faculty a needed resource that they wouldn t find at this scale on any other campus mccartney says  beyond the cloud storage service for the purdue community emc and purdue will work together in several specific ways emc and purdue will jointly develop a new architecture for research data management and curation   emc and purdue will work to develop new technologies to ingest analyze transfer and manage enormous research data sets especially in the field of bioinformatics   with emc s assistance purdue will begin building a repository of all purdue intellectual property research engineers and scientists from both organizations will work together on academic papers and presentations as well as presentations at trade conferences  the purdue emc relationship is needed to address the challenges and opportunities of using data analysis of massive data sets so called big data to gain insights and forecast outcomes by both researchers and students at purdue  purdue has been a leader in using data sets to improve student success and retention with its signals data analytics program big data will be to the next decade what the internet was to the 1990s and early 2000s mccartney says   over the next ten years it will change businesses and education in ways that we can t imagine right now with this partnership we re positioning purdue to be a leader in these changes   our foundational it partner companies have not only committed to provide excellent products and service to purdue but they have also committed to work with us to develop technologies to speed the pace of scientific discoveries and to improve the rate of student success in higher education mccartney says   emc is exactly the kind of company we are looking to partner with in this effort and because we will be advancing data science this relationship has the potential to change every market that uses the internet   '

project for interdisciplinary and distance learning based on the prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases  sophie leli vre the 2012 faculty fellow for the discovery learning research center and a college of veterinary medicine professor is leading the effort to educate and focus the attention of researchers on the little studied field of preventative medicine   my goal is to develop a learning system across disciplines on primary prevention of breast cancer to facilitate the design of multidisciplinary research projects among scholars and prepare future scholars for interdisciplinary and international work in public health leli vre said  leli vre pronounced le lee yea vre believes that primary prevention research is underrepresented in the scientific community  her proposal for a distance learning program was intended to correct this by exposing a large number of college science students across many universities to the current state of the research  future members of the scientific community are drawn from this pool so this should result in a greater awareness and representation of this field  currently leli vre is studying the development and behavior of both normal and cancerous cells using a three dimensional culture that permits the architectural mimicry of physiologically relevant tissue  in particular this culturing method allows her to study the effect of polarity the way cells organize themselves to make certain structures face certain directions on the development of tumors  her laboratory also examines how the genome of cells is affected by the organization of cell components in the nucleus in relation to tissue architecture   most of those who study cancer use already cancerous cells for their research in primary prevention

aS' football findings suggest concussions caused by series of hits members of the jefferson high school football team seen here during a practice last season were monitored in research to learn how impacts to the head affect brain function   purdue university file photo andrew hancock download photo west lafayette ind a two year study of high school football players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head as commonly believed  purdue university researchers have studied football players for two seasons at jefferson high school in lafayette ind where 21 players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season including 16 repeating players  helmet sensor impact data from each player were compared with brain imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before during and after each season   the most important implication of the new findings is the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow but it s really the totality of blows that took place over the season said eric nauman an associate professor of mechanical engineering and an expert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma   the one hit that brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel s back researchers evaluated players using a type of brain imaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging or fmri along with a computer based neurocognitive screening test  the fmri scans reveal which parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks thomas talavage an expert in functional neuroimaging and co director of the purdue mri facility said the scans indicate players are adapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes   the changes in brain activity we are observing suggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced talavage said   the level of change in the fmri signal is significantly correlated to the number and distribution of hits that a player takes performance doesn t change but brain activity changes showing that certain areas are no longer being recruited to perform a task   brain scans show differences among high school football players in a two year study that suggests concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head as commonly believed   purdue university image thomas talavage download photo findings detailed in a paper to appear online in the journal of biomechanics are contrary to conventional thinking   most clinicians would say that if you don t have any concussion symptoms you have no problems said larry leverenz an expert in athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology   however we are finding that there is actually a lot of change even when you don t have symptoms the paper was written by mechanical engineering graduate student evan breedlove nauman leverenz talavage former purdue professor of educational studies jeffrey gilger biomedical engineering graduate student meghan robinson health and kinesiology graduate student katherine e  morigaki electrical and computer engineering graduate student umit yoruk mechanical engineering undergraduate student kyle o keefe and undergraduate student in electrical and computer engineering jeffrey king  gilger is now a researcher at the university of california merced the research may help to determine how many blows it takes to cause impairment which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting the number of hits a player receives per week   any change in fmri data is a concern but we don t yet know what these changes mean what they translate to in terms of cognitive impairment breedlove said  a common assumption in sports medicine is that certain people are innately more susceptible to head injury however the new findings suggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the most important factor talavage said   over the two seasons we had six concussed players but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not have concussions talavage said   there is good correlation with the number of hits players received but we need more subjects the researchers have expanded the study to include an additional high school football team and girls soccer   we want to increase the number of football players in the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don t wear head protection nauman said   we also want to include girls to see whether they are affected differently than boys the research findings represent a dilemma because they suggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose   this might be especially important in young people because the brain is still developing so even though subtle unexpressed damage doesn t manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life gilger said  changes were seen in regions of the brain that have been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte a progressive degenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and other forms of head injury   this is still circumstantial evidence but it suggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as a result of all these hits and the regions most affected are the ones that exhibit cte nauman said  players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1 900 hits to the head in a single season with two players exceeding 1 800 hits  helmet sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 gs to more than 100 gs the worst hit we ve seen was almost 300 gs nauman said  a soccer player heading a ball experiences an impact of about 20 gs findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive and accurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions more accurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from head impacts determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a single impact or repeated impacts and develop new interventions to reduce the risk and effects of head impacts   now that we know there is definitely a buildup of damage before the concussion occurs ultimately there is hope that we can do more to prevent concussions nauman said  the work is ongoing and supported with grants from the indiana state department of health s spinal cord and brain injury research fund general electric healthcare the indiana clinical and translational sciences institute and through the national science foundation and national defense science and engineering graduate fellowships  researchers also will follow the case studies of players who take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes in brain structure using mri scans  the research group called the purdue neurotrauma group png also is studying ways to reduce traumatic brain injury in soldiers

issue in the united states and chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte is the chief long term concern linked to repeated concussions  recently attention has shifted toward subconcussive blows and the role they may play in the development of cte we assembled a cohort of high school football players for two seasons of observation  accelerations sensors were placed in the helmets and all contact activity was monitored pre season computer based neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri tests were also obtained in order to assess cognitive and physiological health  in season follow up scans were then obtained both from individuals who had sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion and those who had not  these changes were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan  in addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes  stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the biomechanical histories of subjects and the ensuing neurophysiological change suggesting that distinct injury processes are at play  our findings reinforce the hypothesis that the effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative and that repeated exposure to subconcussive blows is connected to pathologically altered neurophysiology   '

aS' glyphosate resistant superweeds may be less susceptible to diseases purdue scientists found that soil microbes may play a role in how those weeds react to the popular herbicide glyphosate here glyphosate susceptible biotypes of giant ragweed react differently to the herbicide  the plant on the left is in sterilized field soil void of microbes while the plant on the right is in unsterilized soil photo provided by jessica schafer  west lafayette ind scientists searching for clues to understand how superweeds obtain resistance to the popular herbicide glyphosate may have been missing a critical piece of information a purdue university study shows  glyphosate the active ingredient in the weed killer sold under the name roundup is the most widely used herbicide in the united states but some plants have grown resistant to it  this has caused farmers to turn to additional herbicides while the mechanisms that have led to resistance are not fully known bill johnson a professor of weed science steve hallett an associate professor of weed science and jessica schafer a graduate student in botany and plant pathology believe that soil microbes may play a role  most laboratory tests done to understand glyphosate resistance are done in sterile soil void of those microbes schafer said purdue s findings published online early in the journal weed science show that those microbes may play a significant role in how glyphosate affects plants the soil you re growing the plants in is important to the results schafer said   if we re growing in a sterile media we could get some false positive results because the plants are more tolerant to glyphosate in those conditions   hallett and schafer grew giant ragweed horseweed and common lambsquarter in both sterile soil and field soil and subjected them to glyphosate  in each soil strains of weeds both susceptible and resistant to glyphosate were tested both versions of giant ragweed were damaged more from the glyphosate in field soil  the susceptible version of common lambsquarter was also more heavily damaged in field soil horseweed fared the same no matter which soil or strain susceptible or resistant  the results show that microbes can play an important role in the activity of glyphosate presumably by invading the glyphosate weakened plants  the results also suggest that glyphosate resistant weeds may be more resistant to disease pressure as well soil microbes can be minor to major contributors to how glyphosate is able to affect plants hallett said   we may be selecting not only for glyphosate resistance but inadvertently selecting for weeds that have disease resistance as well   a weed s ability to withstand glyphosate was based on dry shoot and root weight after testing the sterile soil used in the study came from field soil exposed to gamma radiation to kill microbes and bacteria  the irradiated soil was tested to ensure that its nutrients were not diminished hallett johnson and schafer said further studies would look at how fungi in the soil affect root development both with and without glyphosate   dirt is a living organism johnson said it s important to know how all the pieces interact the research was conducted with internal funding from purdue s department of botany and plant pathology  response of giant ragweed ambrosia trifida horseweed conyza canadensis and common lambsquarter chenopodium album biotypes to glyphosate in the presence and absence of soil microorganisms in previous research conducted on non weed species the efficacy of glyphosate was shown to be greater in unsterile soils compared to sterile soils and that soil microorganisms played an important role in glyphosate efficacy  conducting greenhouse studies in microbe free soil may therefore produce unreliable data leading to erroneous conclusions the objective of this study was to determine the effect of soil microorganisms on the response of glyphosate resistant and susceptible biotypes of three problematic weeds of the midwestern united states giant ragweed horseweed and common lambsquarters  a greenhouse dose response study was conducted on each of the three weed species grown in sterile and unsterile field soil and the dry weight response of roots and shoots was measured  the three weed species responded differently to glyphosate when grown in the sterile and unsterile soil that is in the presence and absence of soil microbes  soil microbes influenced the response of the susceptible and resistant giant ragweed biotypes and the susceptible common lambsquarters but not on the tolerant common lambsquarters or either horseweed biotype  the different response of the three species to glyphosate in the presence and absence of soil microbes demonstrates that rhizosphere interactions are fundamental to the mode of action of glyphosate  these findings suggest that the range of tolerance to glyphosate observed in weeds and the evolution of resistance in weed biotypes may also be influenced by rhizosphere interactions  the soil media used in dose response screenings to identify susceptible and resistant weed biotypes is very important unsterile field soil should be incorporated into growth media when conducting dose response screenings to avoid false positive results  in addition researchers performing glyphosate dose response assays should be aware of these findings '

aS' india needs system reforms in education infrastructure culture to grow innovation and commercialization efforts india needs system reforms in education infrastructure culture to grow innovation and commercialization efforts west lafayette ind   india remains one of the world s fastest growing economies but cultural educational infrastructure and leadership challenges are inhibiting growth of its innovation and commercialization efforts a new study by a purdue university professor shows  pankaj sharma a purdue professor with a courtesy appointment in technology leadership and innovation and a native of india who moved to the united states in 1982 said india needs systems driven reforms to promote growth and innovation and sustain the economic growth it has achieved in recent decades his study titled india s national and regional innovation systems challenges opportunities and recommendations for policy makers has been published this month in the journal of industry and innovation the study was done in conjunction with sharma s appointment as a u s state department fulbright new century scholar   there is a need for necessary reforms to affect major change in the innovation system of india but there are both social and cultural barriers such as limited teamwork education and the enduring importance of upward hierarchical progression among other obstacles sharma said   a lack of confidence in innovation capabilities is coupled with a failure to positively reinforce innovation efforts and a strong need for control which gets in the way of cooperation with other organizations   a key challenge facing indian universities research institutions and corporations is an educational system established during the pre liberalization era that emphasizes learning through memorization rather than factual understanding teamwork and creative thinking   the lack of quality education has churned out a workforce with inefficient and inadequate skills rendering the industry academia linkage relatively weak over time said sharma who also serves as managing director of purdue s global sustainability institute in discovery park researchers in india also seem more motivated by publication of their research not patenting and commercialization that could advance the impact of their efforts he said  sharma says india faces a shortage and even an absence in some cases of the necessary support mechanisms that foster commercialization and innovation research funds venture capital funds and start up capital as well as awareness programs and initiatives   a lack of these support systems has resulted in a limited number of innovative ideas relatively few motivated individuals and subsequently very few or minimal incentives for people to generate innovative ideas he said  since its independence from great britain in 1947 india s economy has surged by more than 200 times its per capita annual income led by increases in the size of a middle class consumer a relatively young labor force the manufacturing sector and considerable foreign investments  india s economy ranks as the 11th largest in the world and is the third largest based on purchasing power despite those enviable statistics and an economy ranking among the world s leaders in the mid 2000s indian corporations still face major infrastructure leadership and cultural challenges  to address those sharma says indian companies must focus on local needs by improving basic civil infrastructure such as transportation sanitation and water health care and energy systems  nearly 400 million people in india for example lack access to electricity india spends less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care  for its educational and research institutions india must scale up its entrepreneurial courses and programs and focus on research and technology development relevant to india s infrastructure needs water purification energy pharmaceuticals and pesticides for crops for example  he encouraged indian institutions to reach out to foreign universities to bolster their technology commercialization efforts and heighten collaboration with industry to transfer knowledge as technology  moreover the nation can provide networking opportunities and offer funding incentives that encourage researchers to start companies   most people in indian society are risk averse failure is neither tolerated nor accepted by such people sharma said this lack of tolerance toward failure instills the fear of taking risks  thus making it difficult for them to generate innovative ideas or to promote existing ones eight regional clusters of business incubators educational research institutions and corporations have been identified  the mumbai and pune clusters accounted for the largest number of patent applications followed by the bangalore and delhi clusters  a policy recommendation is to foster local interaction among these actors to exploit synergy to promote innovation and regional economic development  ian p mccarthy the canada research chair in technology operations management and director of the cma innovation centre at simon fraser university in vancouver said the work by sharma provides insights on how the growth of clusters and associated industries contributes to the recent economic growth and development within a number of regions across india   research on the interplay between innovation systems and economic development is regarded as being important to national and regional competiveness  yet there is a dearth of research on how these mechanisms function in the india mccarthy said miranda schreurs director of the environmental policy research centre at germany s freie university in berlin pointed out that sharma and his co authors surveyed more than 30 business incubators funding agencies and research institutions determining what stimulates innovation and what obstructs it  they identify locations in india that generate many patents an indication of innovation governments professor sharma argues could stimulate greater innovation by investing in the development of science and technology entrepreneurial parks and technology business incubators that place scientists and researchers in close proximity with business entrepreneurs she said   although he focuses his attention on the indian context much of what he argues applies to other countries as well note to journalists  a copy of the research paper india s national and regional innovation systems challenges opportunities and recommendations for policy makers is available by contacting phillip fiorini purdue news service at pfiorini purdue edu 765 496 3133 india s national and regional innovation systems challenges opportunities and recommendations for policy makers there is a need for continuous reforms in india s infrastructure innovation culture and dynamic leadership to sustain the growth of innovation  the purpose of this empirical study is to gain a better understanding of india s innovation systems a comprehensive analysis on two levels has been done on both a national level and a regional level  first the section about the national level explores and explains the challenges and opportunities of india s innovation capacity using a semi structured questionnaire of the practitioners  second the section about the regional level discusses the clusters formed within india through a mapping of industrial firms educational research institutions and innovation parks  both an empirical activity framework and a functional based

aS' innovation promises expanded roles for microsensors researchers have learned how to improve the performance of sensors that use tiny vibrating microcantilevers like the one pictured here to detect chemical and biological agents for applications from national security to food processing   vijay kumar birck nanotechnology center purdue university west lafayette ind researchers have learned how to improve the performance of sensors that use tiny vibrating microcantilevers to detect chemical and biological agents for applications from national security to food processing  the microcantilevers slivers of silicon shaped like small diving boards vibrate at their natural or resonant frequency analyzing the frequency change when a particle lands on the microcantilever reveals the particle s presence and potentially its mass and composition  the sensors are now used to research fundamental scientific questions however recent advances may allow for reliable sensing with portable devices opening up a range of potential applications said jeffrey rhoads an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at purdue university creating smaller sensors has been complicated by the fact that measuring the change in frequency does not work as well when the sensors are reduced in size  the researchers showed how to sidestep this obstacle by measuring amplitude or how far the diving board moves instead of frequency   when you try to shrink these systems the old way of measuring does not work as well rhoads said we ve made the signal processing part easier enabling small scale lower power sensors which are more reliable and have the potential for higher sensitivities   findings are detailed in a paper appearing online this week in the journal of microelectromechanical systems the paper was written by graduate research assistants vijay kumar and j  william boley undergraduate student yushi yang mechanical engineering professor george chiu and rhoads an earlier paper was published in april in the weekly journal applied physics letters the work is based at the dynamic analysis of micro and nanosystems laboratory at purdue s birck nanotechnology center  the aim is to apply the new approach to build sensors capable of reliably measuring particles that have a mass of less than one picogram or trillionth of a gram at room temperature and atmospheric pressure  the microcantilever sensors have promise in detecting and measuring constituents such as certain proteins or dna for biological testing in liquids gases and the air  the devices might find applications in breath analyzers industrial and food processing national security and defense and food and water quality monitoring   one question about these sensors is whether they will continue to work in the field rhoads said we ve been doing a lot of blind false positive and false negative tests to see how they perform in a realistic environment  we ve had only a few false positives and negatives in months of testing the findings focus on detecting gases and show that the new sensors should be capable of more reliably measuring smaller quantities of gas than is possible with current sensors  measuring amplitude is far easier than measuring frequency because the amplitude changes dramatically when a particle lands on the microcantilever whereas the change in frequency is minute   we haven t beaten the sensitivity of all other sensors yet rhoads said but the difference is that we are trying to do it with a compact device that is truly implementable at the microscale while many others use fairly large laboratory equipment   the researchers tested the cantilevers in a chamber filled with precisely controlled quantities of methanol to study their reliability  a patent is pending on the invention the research has been partially funded by the national science foundation student support was provided by purdue and the purdue research foundation  note to journalists electronic copies

j william boley student member ieee asme george t   c chiu member ieee asme jeffrey f rhoads member asme the potential to detect very small amounts of added mass has driven research in chemical and biological sensors based on resonant micro and nano electromechanical systems over the past two decades  while traditional resonant mass sensors utilize chemomechanically induced shifts in linear natural frequency for mass detection alternate sensing approaches which exploit the near resonant nonlinear behavior have garnered interest from the research community due to their potential to yield improved sensor metrics and simplify final device implementations  this paper investigates the development of an amplitude based mass sensing approach which utilizes the dynamic transitions that occur near a saddle node bifurcation in the nonlinear frequency response of a piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever  specifically the work details the modeling analysis and experimental validation of this mass sensing technique the experimental results presented here not only prove the feasibility of the proposed sensing approach but also allows for the direct evaluation of pertinent sensor metrics   '

aS' ipad pharmacy checklist could be prescription for better health matthew murawski a purdue associate professor of pharmacy administration holds an ipad featuring his pharmaceutical therapy related quality of life tool  the tool presents patients with a five question survey that catches medication related side effects purdue university photo andrew hancock  west lafayette ind a quick interactive survey taken on an ipad could help pharmacists and patients better use their brief time together to catch and eliminate harmful drug side effects  matthew murawski a purdue university associate professor of pharmacy administration created a new tool that presents patients with a five question checklist that catches up to 60 percent of all known medication side effects   many patients do not mention side effects to their doctor or pharmacist because they either don t recognize that they are connected to the medication or they consider them the cost they must pay to keep from being ill or dying murawski said   in addition patients who are experiencing side effects are less likely to take the medication as prescribed or may stop taking the medication altogether which can lead to catastrophic health consequences  pharmacists can work with patients to eliminate most of these side effects but they can t help if they don t know what the patient is experiencing   exponential growth in the traffic at pharmacies over the past few decades has slashed the time pharmacists have with each patient to an average of two minutes one third of what the counseling time was 20 years ago and a system was needed to help make the discovery of adverse reactions easier and more efficient he said   with all of the training and education invested in every pharmacist i honestly believe they are the most underutilized health care practitioners murawski said   this tool makes the few minutes available for counseling much more rewarding the checklist results allow the pharmacist to immediately see side effects the patient is experiencing and target their time to solving these problems and improving the patient s quality of life   pharmacists may suggest simple changes like taking a medication after meals or avoiding certain foods or they can work with a patient s physician to change medications or develop a different therapy plan he said  when a patient arrives at a pharmacy they could be handed an ipad with the checklist to fill out while they wait a list of medications including both the generic and brand names is presented on the first screen and the pharmacist selects the medication the patient is taking  a patient is then presented with yes or no questions that cover the most common and serious side effect symptoms and the degree to which the problems are experienced  once the checklist is complete the ipad is returned to the pharmacist the results are displayed as colored bars that show which side effects occurred and which are most problematic  after each consultation the pharmacist resets the checklist before the next patient uses the ipad because the patient does not enter any identifying information and the checklist results are not saved the same ipad can be used by multiple patients without the risk of revealing private information  patients would have the option of allowing their anonymous results to be collected for further research into the incidence of adverse reactions and harmful side effects  murawski s method named pharmaceutical therapy related quality of life or ptrqol began as paper checklists that took up multiple file folders behind a pharmacist s desk  mark sharp director of purdue s hook teleproduction center helped automate the paper checklist and created the user interface and software that is compatible with ipads and other tablet devices and platforms  side effects from medication use in the general population are not routinely tracked and reported the results of clinical trials and the federal government s adverse event notification system were the only sources of such information when murawski began his research two years ago  these represent the extremes of the best and worst conditions he said clinical trials involve ideal conditions in which preselected patients take the drugs exactly according to direction and the adverse event notification system is used only for really severe problems murawski said   these results do not necessarily translate to the reality of use in the general public i wanted to know the sharp end of the spear what was actually happening in the pharmacies and with the average person   a seed grant from lilly endowment inc through purdue s college of pharmacy funded murawski s investigation into the side effects being experienced by patients at 10 community pharmacies in indiana  murawski focused his study on the top 200 most dispensed drugs in the united states which account for 90 percent of the volume in pharmacies  he sorted these medications by their drug classes and then cataloged all of the potential side effects for each class from the 2 000 surveys completed at the sites murawski found that approximately 50 percent of patients reported experiencing a symptom that could be a drug related side effect and pharmacists were able to confirm 20 percent of these were directly tied to medication use  he extracted the incidence rates of each side effect and created a new checklist weighted by the severity of the problem and the most common problems experienced  sometimes side effect symptoms can be a sign of something more serious including taking an improper dose of the drug an interaction with another medication or a harmful drug reaction  the sooner a pharmacist or physician can detect such problems the better murawski said in addition to health risks such problems can be expensive  according to a study published in the journal of the american pharmaceutical association the cost associated with managing drug related problems exceeded 177 4 billion in 2000  the costs to people s health and the health care system from patients not taking a drug as prescribed or discontinuing a medication without consulting a health care practitioner have not been well documented  a study by the international society for pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research that examined drug compliance for patients suffering from diabetes or osteoporosis found that the rate of hospitalization increased as adherence to a medication regimen dropped and overall medical charges were much higher for those who did not take medication as prescribed   if someone stops taking a drug as prescribed for a chronic condition there will be health consequences immediately or years down the road murawski said   the detrimental health effects could lead to hospitalizations or the development of another illness and this can be very expensive for both the individual and the health care system as whole  it is very important to try to work with someone to solve any issues that could keep them from taking a drug as prescribed in addition to the ipad tool murawski sees the potential for a kiosk version that could be integrated with a pharmacy s computer system  a patient could swipe an id card or type in their name and the system would tailor the checklist to their medication records he also hopes pharmacies could incorporate the results into a patient s record and maintain an ongoing history that would allow for more in depth questions with each subsequent visit   currently we present a patient with five questions that get about 50 to 60 percent of all side effects he said if we have more time and can continue down the list of questions and get more specific we could capture all known side effects   murawski plans to continue to accumulate checklist results and gather data about the incidence and severity of medication side effects in the general population and to further refine the ptrqol tool

aS'  nano machine shop shapes nanowires ultrathin films this illustration depicts a new nano machine shop s ability to shape tiny wires an advance that represents a possible future manufacturing method for applications ranging from high speed electronics to solar cells   purdue university image gary cheng download photo west lafayette ind a new nano machine shop that shapes nanowires and ultrathin films could represent a future manufacturing method for tiny structures with potentially revolutionary properties  the structures might be tuned for applications ranging from high speed electronics to solar cells and also may have greater strength and unusual traits such as ultrahigh magnetism and plasmonic resonance which could lead to improved optics computers and electronics  the researchers used their technique to stamp nano and microgears form tiny circular shapes out of a material called graphene an ultrathin sheet of carbon that holds promise for advanced technologies and change the shape of silver nanowires said gary cheng an associate professor of industrial engineering at purdue university we do this shaping at room temperature and atmospheric pressure like a nano machine shop said cheng who is working with doctoral students ji li yiliang liao ting fung chung and sergey suslov and physics professor yong p  chen graphene and nanowires filaments 1 000 times thinner than a human hair have numerous potential applications however technologies are needed to tailor them for specific uses  the new method called laser shock induced shaping makes it possible to tune nanowires by altering electrical and optoelectrical properties that are critical for electronic components  the researchers also have shown how laser shock induced shaping can be used to change the properties of graphene a step toward harnessing the material for electronic applications  findings were detailed in research papers published in the journal nano letters and the work also was highlighted earlier this month in the news and views section of the journal nature photonics the article is available at http www nature com nphoton journal v6 n8 full nphoton 2012 186 html the technique works by using a multilayered sandwich structure that has a tiny mold at the bottom  nanowires were situated directly above the mold and other materials were layered between the nanowires and a glass cover sheet  exposing this layered forming unit to an ultra fast pulsing laser causes one of the layers to burn up generating a downward pressure that forces the nanowires into the mold and changes their shape   the process could be scaled up for an industrial roll to roll manufacturing process by changing laser beam size and scanning speed cheng said   the laser shock induced shaping approach is fast and low cost part of the research funded by the national science foundation was carried out in a specialized clean room at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park  note to journalists copies of the research papers are available by contacting emil venere 765 494 4709 venere purdue edu abstract graphene has many promising physical properties it has been discovered that local strain in a graphene sheet can alter its conducting properties and transport gaps  it is of great importance to develop scalable strain engineering techniques to control the local strains in graphene and understand the limit of the strains  here we present a scalable manufacturing process to generate 3 d nanostructures and thus induce local strains in the graphene sheet  this process utilizes laser induced shock pressure to generate 3 d tunable straining the graphene sheet the size dependent straining limit of the graphene and the critical breaking pressure are both studied  it is found that the graphene film can be formed to a circular mold 126 50nm in diameter with an aspect ratio of 0 25 and strain of 12 and the critical breaking pressure is 1 77gpa  these values were found to be decreasing with the increase of mold size the local straining and breaking of graphene film are verified by raman spectra  large scale processing of the graphene sheet into nano scale patterns is presented the process could be scaled up to roll to roll process by changing laser beam size and scanning speed  the presented laser shock straining approach is a fast tunable and low cost technique to realize strain engineering of graphene for its applications in nano electrical devices  abstract one dimensional nanomaterials have attracted a great deal of research interest in the past few decades due to their unique mechanical electrical and optical properties  changing the shape of nanowires nws is both challenging and crucial to change the property and open wide functions of nws such as strain engineering electronic transport mechanical properties band structure and quantum properties etc  here we report a scalable strategy to conduct cutting bending and periodic straining of nws by making use of laser shock pressure  three dimensional shaping of silver nws is demonstrated during which the ag nws exhibit very good ductility strain to failure reaches 110  meanwhile the high electrical conductivity of ag nws could retain well under controlled laser shock pressure the microstructure observation indicates that the main deformation mechanism in ag nws under dynamic loading is formation of twinning and stacking fault while dislocation motion and pile up is less obvious  this method could be applied to semiconductor nws as well '

aS'  nanoresonators might improve cell phone performance this image from a scanning electron microscope shows a tiny mechanical device an electrostatically actuated nanoresonator that might ease congestion over the airwaves to improve the performance of cell phones and other portable devices   purdue university image download photo west lafayette ind researchers have learned how to mass produce tiny mechanical devices that could help cell phone users avoid the nuisance of dropped calls and slow downloads  the devices are designed to ease congestion over the airwaves to improve the performance of cell phones and other portable devices   there is not enough radio spectrum to account for everybody s handheld portable device said jeffrey rhoads an associate professor of mechanical engineering at purdue university  the overcrowding results in dropped calls busy signals degraded call quality and slower downloads to counter the problem industry is trying to build systems that operate with more sharply defined channels so that more of them can fit within the available bandwidth   to do that you need more precise filters for cell phones and other radio devices systems that reject noise and allow signals only near a given frequency to pass said saeed mohammadi an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering who is working with rhoads doctoral student hossein pajouhi and other researchers  the purdue team has created devices called nanoelectromechanical resonators which contain a tiny beam of silicon that vibrates when voltage is applied  researchers have shown that the new devices are produced with a nearly 100 percent yield meaning nearly all of the devices created on silicon wafers were found to function properly   we are not inventing a new technology we are making them using a process that s amenable to large scale fabrication which overcomes one of the biggest obstacles to the widespread commercial use of these devices rhoads said  findings are detailed in a research paper appearing online in the journal ieee transactions on nanotechnology the paper was written by doctoral students lin yu and pajouhi rhoads mohammadi and graduate student molly nelis  in addition to their use as future cell phone filters such nanoresonators also could be used for advanced chemical and biological sensors in medical and homeland defense applications and possibly as components in computers and electronics  the devices are created using silicon on insulator or soi fabrication the same method used by industry to manufacture other electronic devices  the resonators can be readily integrated into electronic circuits and systems because soi is compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology or cmos another mainstay of electronics manufacturing used to manufacture computer chips  the new device is said to be highly tunable which means it could enable researchers to overcome manufacturing inconsistencies that are common in nanoscale devices   because of manufacturing differences no two nanoscale devices perform the same rolling off of the assembly line rhoads said   you must be able to tune them after processing which we can do with these devices the heart of the device is a silicon beam attached at two ends  the beam which vibrates in the center like a jump rope is about two microns long and 130 nanometers wide or about 1 000 times thinner than a human hair  applying alternating current to the beam causes it to selectively vibrate side to side or up and down and also allows the beam to be finely adjusted or tuned  the nanoresonators were shown to control their vibration frequencies better than other resonators the devices might replace electronic parts to achieve higher performance and lower power consumption   a vivid example is a tunable filter mohammadi said it is very difficult to make a good tunable filter with transistors inductors and other electronic components but a simple nanomechanical resonator can do the job with much better performance and at a fraction of the power   not only are they more efficient than their electronic counterparts he said but they also are more compact because the devices are tiny and the fabrication has almost a 100 percent yield we can pack millions of these devices in a small chip if we need to mohammadi said   it s too early to know exactly how these will find application in computing but since we can make these tiny mechanical devices as easily as transistors we should be able to mix and match them with each other and also with transistors in order to achieve specific functions  not only can you put them side by side with standard computer and electronic chips but they tend to work with near 100 percent reliability   the new resonators could provide higher performance than previous mems or microelectromechanical systems in sensing application the design enables researchers to precisely measure the frequency of the vibrating beam which changes when a particle lands on it  analyzing this frequency change allows researchers to measure minute masses similar sensors are now used to research fundamental scientific questions  however recent advances may allow for reliable sensing with portable devices opening up a range of potential applications rhoads said  such sensors have promise in detecting and measuring constituents such as certain proteins or dna for biological testing in liquids gases and the air and the nems might find applications in breath analyzers industrial and food processing national security and defense and food and water quality monitoring   the smaller your system the smaller the mass you can measure rhoads said most of the field deployable sensors we ve seen in the past have been based on microscale technologies so this would be hundreds or thousands of times smaller meaning we should eventually be able to measure things that much smaller   the work is based at the dynamic analysis of micro and nanosystems laboratory at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park  other faculty members and graduate students also use the specialized facility the researchers have filed a patent application for the concept  the research is funded by the national science foundation note to journalists an electronic copy of the research paper is available from emil venere 765 494 4709  venere purdue edu abstract lin yu hossein pajouhi molly r nelis jeffrey f rhoads and saeed mohammadi senior member ieee resonant nanoelectromechanical systems nems have the potential to have significant impact in mass sensing signal processing and field detection applications if the challenges associated with processing material and geometric variability can be mitigated  the research presented here details a breakthrough in the design and development of resonant nems aimed at addressing these challenges  specifically the work details the fabrication characterization and tuning of dual gate silicon nanoelectromechanical resonators which are transduced electrostatically and realized with close to 100 yield  these devices are fabricated

aS' new design tool nixes mouse users create shapes with hands only these shapes were produced with handy potter a new design tool developed at the c design lab in purdue s school of mechanical engineering that enables people to create and modify three dimensional objects with their bare hands  the system uses a depth sensing camera and advanced software algorithms to interpret hand movements and gestures purdue university image  download photo west lafayette ind researchers have developed a design tool that enables people to create three dimensional objects with their bare hands by using a depth sensing camera and advanced software algorithms to interpret hand movements and gestures   it allows people to express their ideas rapidly and quickly using hand motions alone said karthik ramani purdue university s donald w  feddersen professor of mechanical engineering we re democratizing the design process you don t have to be an engineer or an accomplished potter to use this  you can be a kid the tool called handy potter represents a potentially significant advance in how people interact with computers he said   in our lab we have a saying the mouse is dead ramani said with handy potter we are trying to make the computer interface natural to the user   his research team won an all conference best paper award for the handy potter work to be presented during the asme 2012 international design engineering technical conferences and computers and information in engineering conference this week in chicago  the paper was co authored by ramani and graduate students vinayak sundar murugappan and cecil piya the research funded by the national science foundation addresses the limitations of conventional computer aided design tools that are needed to create geometric shapes  purdue doctoral student vinayak uses handy potter to create a three dimensional object he is represented by a stick figure as he modifies the shape   purdue university image traditional tools require the use of procedures so complicated that it is difficult to become an expert ramani said   handy potter is more of an imagination tool you create the shape while you are completely focused on the idea rather than bothering yourself about the right usage of the tool  the tool learns you and does not become a barrier in creation you don t learn the tool users interact with a computer using natural user interfaces like hand gestures to create and modify shapes   for example there are very intuitive gestures for pulling and bending a shape ramani said you learn the gestures naturally and without any user manual   the tool could have applications in areas including games architecture art and engineering design it uses the microsoft kinect camera which senses three dimensional space  the camera is found in consumer electronics games that can track a person s body without using handheld electronics researchers created advanced algorithms that recognize the hand understand that the hand is interacting with the shape and then modify the shape in response to the hand interaction   a video showing how the system works is available at https engineering purdue edu cdesign wp p 1221 the algorithms are very intelligent ramani said   they represent state of the art synthesis of machine learning geometric modeling and human computer interaction note to

natural and exploratory shape modeling by introducing novel 3 d interactions for creating modifying and manipulating 3 d shapes using arms and hands  though current design tools provide complex modeling functionality they remain non intuitive and require significant training since they segregate 3 d shapes into hierarchical 2 d inputs thus binding the user to stringent procedural steps and making modifications cumbersome  in addition the designer knows what to design when they go to cad systems and the creative exploration in design is lost we present a shape creation paradigm as an exploration of creative imagination and externalization of shapes particularly in the early phases of design  we integrate the capability of humans to express 3 d shapes via hand arm motions with traditional sweep surface representation to demonstrate rapid exploration of a rich variety of fairly complex 3 d shapes  we track the skeleton of users using the depth data provided by low cost depth sensing camera kinect our modeling tool is configurable to provide a variety of implicit constraints for shape symmetry and resolution based on the position orientation and speed of the arms  intuitive strategies for coarse and fine shape modifications are also proposed we conclusively demonstrate the creation of a wide variety of product concepts and show an average modeling time of only a few seconds while retaining the intuitiveness of communicating the design intent   '

aS' new microtweezers may build tiny mems structures purdue researchers have created a new type of microtweezers capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures print coatings to make advanced sensors and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research   birck nanotechnology center photo west lafayette ind researchers have created new microtweezers capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures print coatings to make advanced sensors and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research  the microtweezers might be used to assemble structures in microelectromechanical systems or mems which contain tiny moving parts  mems accelerometers and gyroscopes currently are being used in commercial products a wider variety of mems devices however could be produced through a manufacturing technology that assembles components like microscopic lego pieces moved individually into place with microtweezers said cagri savran pronounced chary savran an associate professor of mechanical engineering at purdue university   we ve shown how this might be accomplished easily using new compact and user friendly microtweezers to assemble polystyrene spheres into three dimensional shapes he said  research findings were detailed in a paper that appeared online in december in the journal of microelectromechanical systems or jmems  the paper was written by savran mechanical engineering graduate students bin da chan and farrukh mateen electrical and computer engineering graduate student chun li chang and biomedical engineering doctoral student kutay icoz  purdue researchers have created a new type of microtweezers capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures print coatings to make advanced sensors and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research   birck nanotechnology center photo the new tool contains three main parts a thimble knob from a standard micrometer a two pronged tweezer made from silicon and a graphite interface which converts the turning motion of the thimble knob into a pulling and pushing action to open and close the tweezer prongs  no electrical power sources are needed increasing the potential for practical applications other types of microtweezers have been developed and are being used in research  however the new design is simpler both to manufacture and operate savran said the design contains a one piece compliant structure which is springy like a bobby pin or a paperclip  most other microtweezers require features such as hinges or components that move through heat magnetism or electricity complex designs that are expensive to manufacture and relatively difficult to operate in various media he said  the tweezers make it feasible to precisely isolate individual stem cell spheres from culture media and to position them elsewhere  currently these spheres are analyzed in large groups but microtweezers could provide an easy way to study them by individually selecting and placing them onto analytical devices and sensors   we currently are working to weigh single micro particles individually selected among many others which is important because precise measurements of an object s mass reveal key traits making it possible to identify composition and other characteristics savran said   this will now be as easy as selecting and weighing a single melon out of many melons in a supermarket that work is a collaboration with the research group of timothy ratliff the robert wallace miller director of purdue s center for cancer research  the microtweezers also could facilitate the precision printing of chemical or protein dots onto microcantilevers strips of silicon that resemble tiny diving boards  the microcantilevers can be functionalized or coated with certain chemicals or proteins that attract specific molecules and materials  because they vibrate at different frequencies depending on what sticks to the surface they are used to detect chemicals in the air and water  generally microcantilevers are functionalized to detect one type of substance by exposing them to fluids savran said however being able to microprint a sequence of precisely placed dots of different chemicals on each cantilever could make it possible to functionalize a device to detect several substances at once  such a sensing technology also would require a smaller sample size than conventional diagnostic technologies making it especially practical  the new microtweezers are designed to be attached easily to translation stages currently used in research these stages are essentially platforms on which to mount specimens for viewing and manipulating  unlike most other microtweezers the new device is highly compact and portable and can be easily detached from a platform and brought to another lab while still holding a micro size object for study savran said  the two pronged tweezer is micromachined in a laboratory called a clean room with the same techniques used to create microcircuits and computer chips  the research was based at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park note to journalists an electronic copy of the paper is available from emil venere purdue news service at 765 494 4709  venere purdue edu this letter reports a compact versatile and user friendly micromanipulator that uses an elastically deformable silicon microtweezer to grab microentities and a micrometer head for rotational manual actuation  the micro macroconnection is achieved via a graphite interface that results in a compact and portable design and placement on most translation stages  the system which can operate in both air and liquid and transport objects between the two media has a wide range of applications  we demonstrate but a few of them including in situ construction of microstructures in 3 d isolation and placement of individual microparticles on designated spots on sensors on demand microcontact printing of microparticles and manipulation of

aS' new purdue developed mobile app helps identify tropical plants of costa rica could be used to create other note taking apps new purdue developed mobile app helps identify tropical plants of costa rica could be used to create other note taking apps this screenshot taken from the green notes app provides an image and description of the african oil palm which is found in costa rica   purdue news service photo download photo west lafayette ind some pictures may be worth a thousand words but when it comes to plant identification a snapshot rarely tells the full story  purdue agronomist lori unruh snyder is well aware of the spatial and informational limitations of printed materials unruh snyder an assistant professor realized the true limitations of photo sharing when publishing a field guide to tropical plants  the pocket sized book was perfect for field use but many of the supplemental photos and more detailed plant descriptions she d collected through years of research had to be sacrificed for portability  she couldn t find a good digital guide either so she decided to make her own mobile application and she wanted some help unruh snyder partnered with itap technology consultants to create green notes a mobile app that will help students tourists and plant enthusiasts search for and take notes about plants they see  while green notes is specific to plants it s built on a platform that can be used to create other photographic note taking applications in various fields for faculty who are interested in partnering with itap  in addition to providing a digital searchable plant library green notes allows users to contribute to the resource by capturing plant images and sending them to their personal email or to their desired instructor  the app also contains useful information about the foods in the country to help individuals identify risks and benefits of eating certain plants  the app was named green notes because it represents a new way to digitally catolog plants and keep notes in a paperless environmentally friendly way  other key green notes functionalities include auto geotagging of plant locations and a full listing of plant sub properties such as medicinal or holistic uses  the app retails on itunes for 3 99 a fraction of the cost of most plant identification textbooks and is easily portable unlike a heavy textbook  the app currently lists 95 plants with 260 high quality color images and is increasing in size what we re really trying to do is educate the general public on the plants in costa rica and their uses as eco tourism is a huge part of the country unruh snyder says   the application will be very important for tour guides and will help them explain plants to their clients why the plants are seen where they are in the country and what they are used for   to collect data and provide the most relevant and up to date content unruh snyder frequently travels to costa rica she also shares her passion for the country by leading study abroad excursions on sustainable agriculture food systems   many people don t know for example that pineapples grow as a ground dwelling herbaceous fruit and not on a tree that avocados contain a substance that can prevent hair from turning gray or that cashews have been used to treat fever and sweeten breath unruh snyder says   the app is not only a wonderful educational resource but it benefits students in particular by giving them more confidence in their skills to understand and communicate about the plants around them when they re participating in our study abroad trips  my students and i used the green notes app on a daily basis when we visited costa rica this past may having previously partnered with itap on the creation of ifarm an interactive multimedia simulation of agricultural learning modules unruh snyder is a proponent of adopting new technologies into her curriculum to boost student interaction which she believes benefits learning   in many cases a single snapshot of a tree vine or flower looks nothing like the plant in its natural environement so it often stumps my students when they attempt to identify a specimen in the field she says   for students who don t speak spanish green notes also bridges the communication gap by enabling them to communicate through images and provides the common spanish name of which it is called in costa rica  with this technology you can zoom in on a photo to see additional morphological details that are helpful when identifying the plant   moreover unruh snyder has the ability to update the app with new information as it becomes available which costs less and is faster than updating a book  the platform also may be expanded to incorporate plants from other regions and the technology can be applied to field guide material from other faculty  kyle bowen itap s director of informatics who worked with unruh snyder to create green notes encourages faculty to contact him to discuss additional opportunities in bringing mobility and interactivity to the classroom  while several itap developed mobile applications already are available for broad use bowen and his team are interested in working with instructors to develop new teaching technologies   we want to partner with instructors in creating new tools that enhance the learning and teaching experience both within and outside of the classroom   bowen says our students live in a mobile world we can accommodate them by employing technology that students already own and understand while reducing the cost of educational materials and improving student engagement and access to information   '

aS' new purdue efforts focus on brazil west lafayette ind purdue university s global engineering program has launched an initiative to form collaborations with academia and industry in brazil  the initiative included three study abroad courses this summer oriented toward engineering students in addition to two other classes offered in agriculture and language and culture   more than 50 purdue students and eight faculty visited brazil this summer said william anderson director of the global engineering program   this is an important step toward forging our partnerships there central to the initiative was a study abroad course involving 26 students who delved into issues including alternative energy production transportation infrastructure ecology and the environment  the course was developed by monica prezzi and rodrigo salgado both professors of civil engineering the program was very comprehensive in terms of technical content prezzi said   we had university academic and industrial hosts such study abroad efforts benefit the students as well as the local and purdue communities salgado said   any time you can establish or strengthen ties with the fifth largest economy in the world you are going to realize benefits he said   it s beneficial for purdue students and faculty and for local businesses to interact with this dynamic economy and for our students to be able to work there whether permanently or temporarily  at the same time brazil sends thousands of students abroad with full scholarships every year and purdue should make an effort to attract these students   the purdue students visited the itaipu dam and its bio sanctuary created to mitigate the impacts of construction on wildlife and the environment near the border with argentina and paraguay the santa cruz ethanol plant near sao carlos an airline aircraft maintenance facility in sao carlos the university of sao paulo at sao carlos a new subway line construction site in the city of sao paulo a port construction site in the state of rio de janeiro the port of acu superport complex under construction in campos the petrobras research center in rio de janeiro and the graduate program of coppe ufrj a university in rio de janeiro   brazil is a country of important significance in the world and its stature and prominence will only continue to grow both politically and economically said michael a  brzezinski dean of international programs purdue is actively engaging the country through faculty research and now thanks to the college of engineering via student learning opportunities as well   melba crawford interim head of the school of civil engineering and associate dean of engineering for research said all three courses are in areas of strategic interest to the college of engineering   the interdisciplinary course led by prezzi and salgado provided the type of opportunity we strongly endorse for our students to experience multiple aspects of the profession she said  one of the other engineering oriented study abroad courses led by lia stanciu an associate professor of materials engineering focused on the use of biosensors for environmental monitoring in the rainforest  the other course led by anderson focused on the use of remote sensing from satellites and aircraft to study global climate change and the rainforest   the major technical theme of this program was the role of the rainforest in global climatology and how remote sensing is being used to monitor its health anderson said  other topics included forest ecology land use change and the role of indigenous peoples in conservation efforts after a series of lectures and visits with academic researchers and to the brazilian space agency inpe the students spent four days in amazonia for firsthand observations  inez hua a civil engineering professor and global engineering program associate director for latin america is leading a college of engineering initiative to develop research and education collaborations in brazil  hua and nicholas carpita a professor in the department of botany and plant pathology led a purdue delegation to universities industry and government agencies in sao paulo state   our meetings were very productive and i m confident that we ll develop long term collaborations with our university and corporate partners in brazil hua said  prezzi and salgado who are brazilian began developing their study abroad course two years ago and the other two courses were added later   this is something that s natural for us prezzi said being from brazil we have a network of connections there we know the geography and the language we know how institutions and government agencies work we know the university system  this familiarity enables you to provide the best experience possible for the students of the 26 undergraduate students in the brazilian course 12 were women   this is unusual because engineering courses typically have lower percentages of female students salgado said even more interesting is the fact that we have students from a broad representation of engineering disciplines including chemical engineering mechanical engineering industrial engineering and aeronautics and astronautics  there are many opportunities for jobs in a broad range of industries in brazil and there is a well developed university system  our students need to better understand how business and institutions work there this program will help them to establish interactions with other students professors and private industry in brazil   information

aS' new self calibrating mems bringing accuracy to nanotech this picture shows a new device called a self calibratable mems purdue researchers have demonstrated the tiny machines which could make possible super accurate sensors and motors with far reaching applications   purdue university birck nanotechnology center image jason vaughn clark download photo west lafayette ind researchers have demonstrated tiny machines that could make possible super accurate sensors and motors with far reaching applications from computer storage to altimeters detecting petroleum deposits to measuring dna binding forces  the machines are called self calibratable micro electromechanical systems or mems although mems are in commercial use the new device is the first of its kind capable of self calibration a step critical for applications requiring high performance and accuracy said jason vaughn clark an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and mechanical engineering at purdue university   self calibration is needed because each mems device is slightly different due to variations that occur in manufacturing he said   small variations in microstructure geometry stiffness and mass can significantly affect performance because of this variability no two mems behave identically  since conventional methods to measure mems properties are usually impractical expensive have unknown accuracy and large uncertainty enabling mems to calibrate themselves is a game changing innovation   clark previously developed the self calibration theory he and doctoral student fengyuan li have now created the device and conducted experiments to validate the theory  findings are detailed in a paper to appear later this year in the ieee journal of microelectromechanical systems or jmems the peer reviewed work received a grade of a for innovation and an a for importance to the field which testifies to the significance of the research clark said   i think it s important to note that in 1990 mems pioneer richard muller said research on the mechanical properties of the materials in these devices is needed to provide the engineering base that will make it possible to exploit fully this technology he said   and during a 2007 visit to purdue physics nobel laureate john hall said that without accurate and precise measurements no reliable form of science or engineering is possible   the self calibrating technology makes it possible to accurately measure displacement or how far a measuring device moves on a scale of micrometers to less than a nanometer a range that spans a fraction of the diameter of a human hair to a fraction of the width of an atom   the difficulty in accurately measuring small displacements represents a bottleneck in mems and nanotech advancements clark said   accurate metrology is a problem that has eluded researchers since the beginning of mems and nanotech in the late 1980s displacement is fundamental to science and engineering  we know that quantities like velocity acceleration force stiffness frequency and mass can be related to displacement now using a 15 chip that can fit on your fingertip we showed that our technology is able to measure mems displacements better than a 500 000 electron microscope   introducing accurate measurement methods made the difference between alchemy and chemistry about 230 years ago and self calibrating mems might bring a similar transformation in the world if nanotechnology he said   the ability to perform accurate measurements is of paramount importance to technological advancement he said in the late 1700s antoine lavoisier transformed alchemy to chemistry by introducing quantitative measurements  today some compare the state of micro and nanotechnology to alchemy where nanotechnologists can precisely sense small signals but they have not had a practical way to accurately measure most mechanical quantities  that is no two nanotechnology labs have been able to show that they can measure the same phenomenon and obtain the same numerical result   the heart of the self calibrating mems are two gaps of differing size electrostatic sensors and tiny actuators called comb drives so named because they contain meshing comb like fingers  these meshing fingers are drawn toward each other when a voltage is applied and return to their original position when the voltage is turned off  the comb drives measure the change in an electrical property called capacitance while gauging the distances of the two gaps built into the device  the fine measurements reveal the difference between the device s designed layout and the actual dimensions once you learn the difference between layout and fabrication you have calibrated the device clark said   many mems designs with comb drives can be easily modified to implement our technology our research results suggest the days of inaccurate micro and nano mechanical measurements are numbered   mems accelerometers and gyroscopes currently are being used commercially in products such as the nintendo wii video game iphone automobiles the segway human transporter and walking robots  however those mems don t require ultrahigh accuracy like those used in tactical and navigation grade inertial sensors which must undergo a complex calibration procedure in the factory  the chips are tested using machines that translate rotate shock and heat the devices the new self calibratable mems could eliminate or reduce the need for rigorous factory calibration cutting manufacturing costs clark said   something like 30 percent of manufacturing costs are related to calibration the self calibratable mems could lead to high performance data storage technologies and advanced lithography to create next generation computer circuits and nanodevices  researchers will use the new self calibration approach to improve the accuracy of atomic force microscopes or afms which are tools essential for nanotechnologists  purdue operates about 30 afms and clark s research group will use the calibrated mems to calibrate afm displacement stiffness and force  the group also will use a calibrated mems to measure the difference in gravity between different heights above the ground the ability to measure gravity with such sensitivity could be used as a new tool for detecting underground petroleum deposits   conventional gravity meters can cost over 200 000 clark said they consist of a large vacuum tube and a mirrored mass gravitational acceleration is determined by measuring the drop time of the mass in free fall  since oil or mineral deposits have a different density than surrounding material the local gravity is slightly different the bulky and expensive gravity meters could be replaced with a small and inexpensive mems chip  another potential application is as an altimeter for aircraft conventional altimeters measure height by using air pressure which fluctuates   these altimeters aren t really accurate clark said having a sensor that could accurately determine height would be an asset while flying at night through fog or bad weather  the self calibratable technology also could allow mems to recalibrate themselves after being exposed to harsh temperature changes or remaining dormant for long periods  yet another potential application is the study of exotic phenomena such as forces between molecules and within tiny structures on the scale of nanometers   a more accurate mems device could make it possible to measure physical phenomena that have been beyond the resolution of conventional technology clark said   to fully understand and exploit the attributes of the nanoscale you really have to be able to accurately measure subtle phenomena  without accurate measurement tools it becomes difficult to discover or resolve these phenomena to develop accurate physical models and to subsequently use the models to explore possibilities leading to useful innovations   the work is based at the birck nanotechnology center in purdue s discovery park the research is funded by the national science foundation  writer emil venere 765 494 4709 venere purdue edu note to journalists an electronic copy of the research paper is available from emil venere 765 494 4709  venere purdue edu we present a practical method for measuring planar gaps of mems with comb drives by on chip or off chip electrical probing  we show that our method is practical accurate precise and repeatable the option of on chip postpackaged electrical measurement enables mems to be autonomously self calibratable  we use the measurement of gap to determine the geometrical difference between layout and fabrication which can lead to measurements of other properties such as displacement force stiffness mass etc  our method consists of applying enough voltage to close two unequal gaps and measuring the resulting changes in capacitances many mems designs with comb drives can be easily modified to implement our technology  our results are an order better than convention and suggest means for further improvement '

aS' new system could predict solar flares give advance warning west lafayette ind researchers may have discovered a new method to predict solar flares more than a day before they occur providing advance warning to help protect satellites power grids and astronauts from potentially dangerous radiation  the system works by measuring differences in gamma radiation emitted when atoms in radioactive elements decay or lose energy  this rate of decay is widely believed to be constant but recent findings challenge that long accepted rule the new detection technique is based on a hypothesis that radioactive decay rates are influenced by solar activity possibly streams of subatomic particles called solar neutrinos  this influence can wax and wane due to seasonal changes in the earth s distance from the sun and also during solar flares according to the hypothesis which is supported with data published in a dozen research papers since it was proposed in 2006 said ephraim fischbach a purdue university professor of physics fischbach and jere jenkins a nuclear engineer and director of radiation laboratories in the school of nuclear engineering are leading research to study the phenomenon and possibly develop a new warning system  jenkins monitoring a detector in his lab in 2006 discovered that the decay rate of a radioactive sample changed slightly beginning 39 hours before a large solar flare  since then researchers have been examining similar variation in decay rates before solar flares as well as those resulting from earth s orbit around the sun and changes in solar rotation and activity  the new findings appeared online last week in the journal astroparticle physics it s the first time the same isotope has been used in two different experiments at two different labs and it showed basically the same effect fischbach said  the paper was authored by jenkins and fischbach ohio state university researchers kevin r herminghuysen thomas e blue andrew c  kauffman and joseph w talnagi u s air force researcher daniel javorsek mayo clinic researcher daniel w mundy and stanford university researcher peter a  sturrock data were recorded during routine weekly calibration of an instrument used for radiological safety at ohio state s research reactor  findings showed a clear annual variation in the decay rate of a radioactive isotope called chlorine 36 with the highest rate in january and february and the lowest rate in july and august over a period from july 2005 to june 2011  the new observations support previous work by jenkins and fischbach to develop a method for predicting solar flares advance warning could allow satellite and power grid operators to take steps to minimize impact and astronauts to shield themselves from potentially lethal radiation emitted during solar storms  the findings agree with data previously collected at the brookhaven national laboratory regarding the decay rate of chlorine 36 changes in the decay rate were found to match changes in the earth sun distance and earth s exposure to different parts of the sun itself fischbach said  large solar flares may produce a coronal mass ejection of highly energetic particles which can interact with the earth s magnetosphere triggering geomagnetic storms that sometimes knock out power  the sun s activity is expected to peak over the next year or so as part of an 11 year cycle that could bring strong solar storms  solar storms can be especially devastating if the flare happens to be aimed at the earth hitting the planet directly with powerful charged particles  a huge solar storm called the carrington event hit the earth in 1859 a time when the only electrical infrastructure consisted of telegraph lines   there was so much energy from this solar storm that the telegraph wires were seen glowing and the aurora borealis appeared as far south as cuba fischbach said   because we now have a sophisticated infrastructure of satellites power grids and all sort of electronic systems a storm of this magnitude today would be catastrophic  having a day and a half warning could be really helpful in averting the worst damage satellites for example might be designed so that they could be temporarily shut down and power grids might similarly be safeguarded before the storm arrived   we have repeatedly seen a precursor signal preceding a solar flare fischbach said we think this has predictive value the purdue experimental setup consists of a radioactive source manganese 54 and a gamma radiation detector  as the manganese 54 decays it turns into chromium 54 emitting a gamma ray which is recorded by the detector to measure the decay rate  research findings show evidence that the phenomenon is influenced by the earth s distance from the sun for example decay rates are different in january and july when the earth is closest and farthest from the sun respectively   when the earth is farther away we have fewer solar neutrinos and the decay rate is a little slower jenkins said when we are closer there are more neutrinos and the decay a little faster   neutrinos have the least mass of any known subatomic particle yet it is plausible that they are somehow affecting the decay rate he said  physicist ernest rutherford known as the father of nuclear physics in the 1930s conducted experiments indicating the radioactive decay rate is constant meaning it cannot be altered by external influences   since neutrinos have essentially no mass or charge the idea that they could be interacting with anything is foreign to physics jenkins said   so we are saying something that doesn t interact with anything is changing something that can t be changed either neutrinos are affecting decay rate or perhaps an unknown particle is   jenkins discovered the effect by chance in 2006 when he was watching television coverage of astronauts spacewalking at the international space station  a solar flare had erupted and was thought to possibly pose a threat to the astronauts he decided to check his equipment and discovered that a change in decay rate had preceded the solar flare  further research is needed to confirm the findings and to expand the work using more sensitive equipment he said jenkins and fischbach have previously collaborated with peter sturrock a professor emeritus of applied physics at stanford university and an expert on the inner workings of the sun to examine data collected at brookhaven on the decay rate of radioactive isotopes silicon 32 and chlorine 36 the team reported in 2010 in astroparticle physics that the decay rate for both isotopes varies in a 33 day recurring pattern which they attribute to the rotation rate of the sun s core  the group found evidence of the same annual and 33 day effect in radium 226 data taken at the physikalisch technische bundesanstalt ptb in braunschweig germany and those findings were published in 2011  they also found an additional 154 day recurring pattern in both the brookhaven and ptb data published in 2011 which they believe to be solar related and similar to a known solar effect called a rieger periodicity  note to journalists an electronic

36cl the detector system used was based on a geiger m ller gas detector which is a robust detector system with very low susceptibility to environmental changes  a clear annual variation is evident in

aS'  no sleep energy bugs drain smartphone batteries west lafayette ind researchers have proposed a method to automatically detect a new class of software glitches in smartphones called no sleep energy bugs which can entirely drain batteries while the phones are not in use   these energy bugs are a silent battery killer said y charlie hu a purdue university professor of electrical and computer engineering   a fully charged phone battery can be drained in as little as five hours because conserving battery power is critical for smartphones the industry has adopted an aggressive sleep policy he said   what this means is that smartphones are always in a sleep mode by default when there are no active user interactions such as screen touches every component including the central processor stays off unless an app instructs the operating system to keep it on   for example a mailer may need to automatically update email by checking with the remote server hu said to prevent the phone from going to sleep during such operations smartphone manufacturers make application programming interfaces or apis available to app developers  the developers insert the apis into apps to instruct the phone to stay awake long enough to perform necessary operations app developers have to explicitly juggle different power control apis that are exported from the operating systems of the smartphones hu said   unfortunately programmers are only human they make mistakes when using these apis which leads to software bugs that mishandle power control preventing the phone from engaging the sleep mode  as a result the phone stays awake and drains the battery findings are detailed in a research paper being presented during the 10th international conference on mobile systems applications and services or mobisys 2012 june 25 29 in the united kingdom the paper was written by doctoral students abhinav pathak and abhilash jindal hu and samuel midkiff a purdue professor of electrical and computer engineering  the researchers have completed the first systematic study of the no sleep bugs and have proposed a method for automatically detecting them   we ve had anecdotal evidence concerning these no sleep energy bugs but there has not been any systematic study of them until now midkiff said  the researchers studied 187 android applications that were found to contain android s explicit power control apis called wakelocks   of the 187 apps 42 were found to contain errors or bugs in their wakelock code findings showed the new tool accurately detected all 12 previously known instances of no sleep energy bugs and found 30 new bugs in the apps  the glitch has been found in interactive apps such as phone applications and services for telephony on android that must work even though the user isn t touching the phone  the app may fail to engage the sleep mode after the interactive session is completed you don t see any difference hu said you put it in your pocket and you think everything is fine  you take it out and your battery is dead to detect bugs in the applications the researchers modified a tool called a compiler which translates code written in computer languages into the binary code that computers understand  the tool they developed adds new functionality to the compiler so that it can determine where no sleep bugs might exist the tool analyzes the binary code and automatically and accurately detects the presence of the no sleep bugs midkiff said  the purdue researchers have coined the term power encumbered programming to describe the smartphone energy bugs researchers concentrated on the android smartphone but the same types of bugs appear to affect other brands hu said  the research has been funded in part by the national science foundation

the national laboratory using a similar high performance computer to improve simulations that show a nuclear weapon s performance in precise molecular detail   photo courtesy of lawrence livermore national laboratory download photo west lafayette ind u s researchers are perfecting simulations that show a nuclear weapon s performance in precise molecular detail tools that are becoming critical for national defense because international treaties forbid the detonation of nuclear test weapons  the simulations must be operated on supercomputers containing thousands of processors but doing so has posed reliability and accuracy problems said saurabh bagchi an associate professor in purdue university s school of electrical and computer engineering now researchers at purdue and high performance computing experts at the national nuclear security administration s nnsa lawrence livermore national laboratory have solved several problems hindering the use of the ultra precise simulations  nnsa is the quasi independent agency within the u s department of energy that oversees the nation s nuclear security activities  the simulations which are needed to more efficiently certify nuclear weapons may require 100 000 machines a level of complexity that is essential to accurately show molecular scale reactions taking place over milliseconds or thousandths of a second  the same types of simulations also could be used in areas such as climate modeling and studying the dynamic changes in a protein s shape  such highly complex jobs must be split into many processes that execute in parallel on separate machines in large computer clusters bagchi said   due to natural faults in the execution environment there is a high likelihood that some processing element will have an error during the application s execution resulting in corrupted memory or failed communication between machines bagchi said   there are bottlenecks in terms of communication and computation these errors are compounded as long as the simulation continues to run before the glitch is detected and may cause simulations to stall or crash altogether   we are particularly concerned with errors that corrupt data silently possibly generating incorrect results with no indication that the error has occurred said bronis r  de supinski co leader of the asc application development environment performance team at lawrence livermore errors that significantly reduce system performance are also a major concern since the systems on which the simulations run are very expensive   advanced simulation and computing is the computational arm of nnsa s stockpile stewardship program which ensures the safety security and reliability of the nation s nuclear deterrent without underground testing  new findings will be detailed in a paper to be presented during the annual ieee ifip international conference on dependable systems and networks from june 25 28 in boston  recent research findings were detailed in two papers last year one presented during the ieee supercomputing conference and the other during the international symposium on high performance parallel and distributed computing   you want the system to automatically pinpoint when and in what machine the error took place and also the part of the code that was involved bagchi said   then a developer can come in look at it and fix the problem streaming data to a central server works fine for a hundred machines but it can t keep up when you are streaming data from a thousand machines said purdue doctoral student ignacio laguna who worked with lawrence livermore computer scientists   we ve eliminated this central brain so we no longer have that bottleneck each machine in the supercomputer cluster contains several cores or processors and each core might run one process during simulations  the researchers created an automated method for clustering or grouping the large number of processes into a smaller number of equivalence classes with similar traits  grouping the processes into equivalence classes makes it possible to quickly detect and pinpoint problems the recent breakthrough was to be able to scale up the clustering so that it works with a large supercomputer bagchi said  lawrence livermore computer scientist todd gamblin came up with the scalable clustering approach a lingering bottleneck in using the simulations is related to a procedure called checkpointing or periodically storing data to prevent its loss in case a machine or application crashes  the information is saved in a file called a checkpoint and stored in a parallel system distant from the machines on which the application runs   the problem is that when you scale up to 10 000 machines this parallel file system bogs down bagchi said it s about 10 times too much activity for the system to handle and this mismatch will just become worse because we are continuing to create faster and faster computers   doctoral student tanzima zerin and rudolf eigenmann a professor of electrical and computer engineering along with bagchi led work to develop a method for compressing the checkpoints similar to the compression of data for images   we re beginning to solve the checkpointing problem bagchi said it s not completely solved but we are getting there the checkpointing bottleneck must be solved in order for researchers to create supercomputers capable of exascale computing or 1 000 quadrillion operations per second  the research has been funded by lawrence livermore and the national science foundation the work also involves lawrence livermore scientists greg bronevetsky dong h  ahn martin schulz and ibm austin researcher mootaz elnozahy laguna was awarded a george michael memorial high performance computing fellowship during the supercomputing 2011 conference in recognition of his work on the project  the supercomputing conference paper can be accessed online at ieeexplore or acm digital library or from the research group s home page at https engineering purdue edu dcsl purdue researchers did not work with the actual classified nuclear weapons software code but instead used generic benchmarks a set of programs designed to help evaluate the performance of parallel supercomputers  donald b johnston senior editor press officer lawrence livermore national laboratory 925 423 4902 johnston19 llnl gov enterprise and high performance computing systems are growing extremely large and complex employing many processors and diverse software hardware stacks 1  as these machines grow in scale faults become more frequent and system complexity makes it difficult to detect and diagnose them  the difficulty is particularly large for faults that degrade system performance or cause erratic behavior but do not cause outright crashes  the cost of these errors is high since they significantly reduce system productivity both initially and by time required to resolve them  current system management techniques 2 3 do not work well since they require manual examination of system behavior and do not identify root causes  when a fault is manifested system administrators need timely notification about the type of fault the time period in which it occurred and the processor on which it originated  statistical modeling approaches can accurately characterize normal and abnormal system behavior 4 however the complex effects of system faults are less amenable to these techniques  this paper demonstrates that the complexity of system faults makes traditional classification and clustering algorithms inadequate for characterizing them  we design novel techniques that combine classification algorithms with information on the abnormality of application behavior to improve detection and characterization accuracy significantly  our experiments demonstrate that our techniques can detect and characterize faults with 85 accuracy compared to just 12 accuracy for direct applications of traditional techniques   '

aS' op ed understanding media violence once again the horror of a violent assault has spread around the globe at the speed of light just as the many incidents that preceded it the recent tragedy in aurora colo   has reignited the cultural debate on media violence it is difficult to know to what extent if any the consumption of media messages had to do with the killer s decision to unleash his assault on an unsuspecting movie audience  in response to some voices that react to such assaults by talking about the possible influence of media some others shout back movies don t kill people people kill people   of course this is true and many of those who make this point bristle at the notion that by talking about media influence on behavior the spotlight is redirected away from personal responsibility for one s actions  but we ought to resist feeling forced to choose between a view that emphasizes personal responsibility for behavior and an understanding that the media messages that fill our culture surely have an impact upon us  both are true just as we are all personally responsible for our purchasing decisions we are all responsible for our choice to either refrain from or to engage in violence  but few of us believe that the barrage of commercial messages in our culture have no influence upon us advertisers and researchers know better  similarly we ought to know better than to accept the premise that media violence has no impact on us decades of research clearly establish that media messages have power  the late george gerbner who spent most of his career studying media violence at the university of pennsylvania pointed out that prior to the advent of electronic media the central storytellers of culture were parents educational institutions and the church  the primary motivation for telling those stories was to inspire teach and preserve important values but the structure of electronic media has altered the balance of influence of those traditional sources  today many of the most influential stories that permeate our cultural environment are told by folks who care less about the stories they tell and more about how many stories they can sell  media violence is relatively cheap to produce and speaks in a universal language that is easily exported across cultures to make billions in profits  violence is part of life and to think that it ought never to appear in any of the stories that humans tell is unrealistic we can learn some important lessons from stories that contain violent themes  but today the level of graphic violence being produced for entertainment and commercial profit is completely unprecedented in human history  to think that we can immerse ourselves and our children in this entertainment without being affected by it is absolutely na ve  decades of research show otherwise surely we all have personal responsibility for our actions but just as surely the cultural environment created by the steady stream of media messages that surround us have their impact  viewers who consume large amounts of violence over time are desensitized to it this puts us at risk we ought to be cognizant of both of these truths and attempt to live our lives accordingly striving for the best that we can do for ourselves and for each other  sometimes the best thing to do is to just turn the tv off or change to a different channel glenn g sparks is professor and associate head of the brian lamb school of communication at purdue university  '

aS' pill some day may prevent serious foodborne illness scientist says west lafayette ind modified probiotics the beneficial bacteria touted for their role in digestive health could one day decrease the risk of listeria infection in people with susceptible immune systems according to purdue university research  arun bhunia a professor of food science mary anne amalaradjou a purdue postdoctoral researcher and ok kyung koo a former purdue doctoral student found that the same listeria protein that allows the bacteria to pass through intestinal cells and into bloodstreams can help block those same paths when added to a probiotic   based on the research it looks very promising that we would get a significant reduction in listeria infections said bhunia whose findings were published this month in the journal plos one  bhunia s earlier work showed that listeria triggers intestinal cells to express heat shock protein 60 on their surfaces that allows listeria to bind to the intestinal cells using an adhesion protein and pass into them acting as a sort of gateway to the bloodstream  once in the bloodstream even small doses of listeria can cause fever muscle aches nausea and diarrhea as well as headaches stiff neck confusion loss of balance and convulsions if it spreads to the nervous system  it can also cause abortion and stillbirth in pregnant women according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention it sickens about 1 500 and kills 255 people each year in the united states and primarily affects pregnant women newborns older adults and those with weakened immune systems   we re seeing fewer listeria infections but the severity of those infections is still high amalaradjou said the researchers found that probiotics alone were ineffective in combatting listeria so they stole a trick from the bacteria s own playbook  by adding the listeria adhesion protein to the probiotic lactobacillus paracasei they were able to decrease the number of listeria cells that passed through intestinal cells by 46 percent a significant decrease in the amount of the bacteria that could infect a susceptible person  with the adhesion protein lactobacillus paracasei interacts with heat shock protein on the surface of intestinal cells just as listeria would  the probiotic then attached to the intestinal cells crowding out listeria it s creating a competition bhunia said if listeria comes in it doesn t find a place to attach or invade   bhunia said he could one day foresee the development of a pill or probiotic drink that could be given to at risk patients to minimize the risk of listeria infection  the results came from tests on human intestinal cells the next step would be animal testing bhunia said that would allow him to see whether different doses would have a greater effect  bhunia used funding from the u s department of agriculture in previous work on listeria but the current study was internally funded  recombinant probiotic expressing listeria adhesion protein attenuateslisteria monocytogenes virulence in vitro background listeria monocytogenes an intracellular foodborne pathogen infects immunocompromised hosts  the primary route of transmission is through contaminated food in the gastrointestinal tract it traverses the epithelial barrier through intracellular or paracellular routes  strategies to prevent l monocytogenes entry can potentially minimize infection in high risk populations listeria adhesion protein lap aids l  monocytogenes in crossing epithelial barriers via the paracellular route the use of recombinant probiotic bacteria expressing lap would aid targeted clearance of listeria from the gut and protect high risk populations from infection  methodology principal findings the objective was to investigate the ability of probiotic bacteria or lap expressing recombinant probiotic lactobacillus paracasei lbplap to prevent l  monocytogenes adhesion invasion and transwell based transepithelial translocation in a caco 2 cell culture model several wild type probiotic bacteria showed strong adhesion to caco 2 cells but none effectively prevented l  monocytogenes infection pre exposure to lbplap for 1 4 15 or 24 h significantly p 0 05 reduced adhesion invasion and transepithelial translocation of l  monocytogenes in caco 2 cells whereas pre exposure to parental lb paracasei had no significant effect similarly lbplap pre exposure reduced l  monocytogenes translocation by as much as 46 after 24 h lbplap also prevented l monocytogenes mediated cell damage and compromise of tight junction integrity  furthermore lbplap cells reduced l monocytogenes mediated cell cytotoxicity by 99 8 after 1 h and 79 after 24 h conclusions significance wild type probiotic bacteria were unable to prevent l  monocytogenes infection in vitro in contrast lbplap blocked adhesion invasion and translocation of l monocytogenes by interacting with host cell receptor hsp60 thereby protecting cells from infection  these data show promise for the use of recombinant probiotics in preventing l monocytogenes infection in high risk populations   '

aS' purdue iu health arnett launch colorectal cancer research partnership west lafayette ind purdue university and indiana university health arnett on wednesday sept 12 announced a joint clinical research study on colorectal cancer focused on broadening participation from patients in more rural parts of the state  research teams from the two universities are working with colorectal cancer data to develop tools for helping improve prevention treatment and care of those with cancer  with the clinical data researchers are refining statistical and engineering simulation models to predict how to treat and possibly prevent cancer   this is another terrific example of how great things can happen when iu purdue and the private sector collaborate on a major challenge facing our world in this case colorectal cancer said vic lechtenberg acting executive vice president for academic affairs and provost at purdue   this partnership between iu health arnett and purdue widens the bridge for our scientists and clinicians added dr wael harb director of oncology and research for iu health arnett in lafayette and a partner in the purdue iu research advocacy effort cancer won t be eradicated in a single laboratory by an individual researcher  we all must come together to assist the research that s being done to give doctors the tools they need to better diagnose and treat cancer   this research partnership with a goal to consent 100 cancer patients expands the university led cancer care engineering project which was launched by purdue in partnership with the indiana university melvin and bren simon cancer center in 2006 through 5 million in funding from the u s department of defense the walther cancer foundation and the regenstrief foundation   here in a community setting like lafayette west lafayette that s where 90 percent of cancer patients are treated said marietta harrison associate vice president for research at purdue and director of discovery park s oncological sciences center who is leading the purdue portion of the partnership with iu health arnett since the clinical study gained federal approval on july 31 the cancer study has gained more than a dozen participants  the key to conquering cancer is early detection harrison said a focus of the cancer care engineering project is to discover biomarkers in individual s blood and tissue that will predict susceptibility to colon cancer its early onset and which treatment is most likely to work  this research requires this type of partnership with the medical community and help from local individuals who wish to participate in research studies   partnership with iu health arnett in this clinical trial on colorectal cancer will help our researchers from purdue and iu gather samples that will give us a more complete picture of the progression of cancer in patients harrison said  according to dr harb more than 1 000 drugs designed to treat cancer are in the pipeline but it can take 15 20 years of regulatory hurdles and other steps for a single drug to reach a patient  at the same time 5 percent or fewer of all cancer patients currently participate in clinical trials that percentage must climb if the medical community stands any chance of defeating cancer he said   people are still dying of cancer and that s not acceptable so we need to find answers harb said research is the only way to find a cure for cancer  without research we d have zero chance to treat cancer in conjunction with this partnership purdue and iu simon cancer center received a 500 000 grant from the national institutes of health this spring to launch a regional research advocacy network for educating the public about the role they can play in cancer research the community based project awarded to purdue

advocacy network ran which is a nonprofit organization formed in 2003 to bring together participants in the research process with a focus on educating supporting and connecting patient advocates with the medical research community   we can t change what has already happened but we can make a difference in how cancer is fought for those yet to come said project partner lori miller outreach coordinator for the lafayette based community cancer network in north central indiana   cancer is survivable and we can make it so for more people miller knows that firsthand she has battled three separate cancers in the past decade and today is cancer free  now she spends her time encouraging people to participate in cancer research even those not currently suffering from cancer can help in this cause   without more people participating in these trials drugs that researchers at purdue and elsewhere will not get the approval in time to help people miller said  the cancer care engineering

aS' purdue expert says super bowl ads may not be worth the money west lafayette ind nbc has reported that it sold out advertising time for this year s super bowl broadcast before the end of last year  and 30 second spots sold for a record 3 5 million despite the demand super bowl commercials probably aren t worth the premium prices paid to air them says richard feinberg a consumer psychologist in purdue university s department of consumer sciences and retailing  more than 100 million people are expected to watch the feb 5 super bowl matchup between the new england patriots and new york giants which will be played at lucas oil stadium in indianapolis  when they aren t watching football fans will be entertained by commercials for everything from beer to clothing to cars this year more ads than normal are expected to be longer than the traditional 30 seconds  the problem feinberg says is that repetition is the key to sales and beyond the super bowl some of the commercials don t get much on air play to the specific consumer groups who buy the products and services advertised   since repetition to the right consumer is the foundation of purchases companies just might be better off with 10 350 000 commercials targeted to specific consumers than one 3 5 million commercial targeted to a lot of consumers but not necessarily the right ones he says  research suggests that many viewers like the ads as much or more than the game itself feinberg says while the extra attention further enhances the effect of a 30 second commercial liking an ad doesn t necessarily lead to sales  a study by feinberg suggests that even if people watch the commercials they have a limited impact on longer term memory and if consumers cannot remember the companies or the products the commercials do not lead to sales  he asked 100 consumers who watched the 2010 super bowl to recall details from as many commercials as they could about 30 percent could accurately recall at least one company with a commercial but respondents had low confidence in their memory indicating that they thought that the company had a commercial  few could accurately recall details of the commercials feinberg says the most effective super bowl commercials are connected to a range of social media other advertisements and promotions  the use of animals humor special effects and celebrities increase memorability but that alone does not mean an increase in sales he says   the best commercials tap into helping consumers solve a problem fill a need make them look better feel better or be better the problem with super bowl commercials is that there is so much effort to be creative and cute that the real reason why commercials work is lost and ignored feinberg says   super bowl commercials are celebrated for their creativity and humor but that doesn t guarantee that consumers will become more aware of a product or make a purchase more likely than if the money had been spent in a less expensive but more effective way   source richard feinberg 765 494 8301 xdj1 purdue edu the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration s center of sponsored coastal ocean research funded the research   '

agriculture s outlook for the nation s corn and soybean harvests reflects what farmers have been seeing for the past two months vanishing prospects for a good year as their crops wilt from lack of water  the usda s august crop production report the first projections of how much corn soybean and other crops are expected to produce this year paints a bleak picture as indiana and other eastern corn belt states suffer through the worst drought since at least 1988  in the report released friday aug 10 usda estimated indiana s corn crop would produce 605 million bushels on yields averaging about 100 bushels per acre a per acre decrease of 46 bushels from 2011 and 57 4 bushels from indiana s five year average  soybeans are projected to yield 37 bushels per acre down 8 bushels from last year and 9 7 bushels from the five year average these are remarkably low numbers especially on the corn said chris hurt purdue extension agricultural economist   indiana is the worst of the major production states in terms of corn production we knew that early on it started here and then spread to the west   hurt was among agricultural experts who reviewed the crop production report during a panel discussion at the indiana state fairgrounds  greg matli deputy director of the usda national agricultural statistics service s indiana field office summarized the report which projects that the nation s farmers will produce 10 8 billion bushels of corn  that is down 13 percent from last year which also was not a good crop year because of a less severe drought soybean production is forecast at 2 6 billion bushels down 12 percent from last year  the agriculture industry expected bumper crops in indiana and across the midwest when farmers began planting earlier than normal this spring in what was then favorable weather unseasonable warmth and little rain  there were forecasts that the nation s farmers could produce a corn crop of 14 billion bushels nearly 1 billion more than the previous record if the weather cooperated  this surreal looking soybean field near dayton in tippecanoe county is a victim of the 2012 drought that started in the spring and worsened into the summer   purdue agricultural communication photo tom campbell download photo but conditions soon deteriorated for crops as the heat intensified and fields got hardly any rain at all over the next three months  hopes for a bountiful harvest evaporated as the drought worsened weekly preventing many corn and soybean crops from developing enough to produce strong yields  by the end of the first week of august nearly three fourths of the state s corn crop 73 percent and 53 percent of soybeans were in poor to very poor condition  because of that usda estimates indiana s 2012 corn crop will yield nearly 38 percent below trend yields this is the worst departure from trend yields in indiana in at least 75 years said bob nielsen purdue extension corn specialist  that includes the 1988 corn crop which was down 30 percent from the previous year soybeans were down 20 percent this year indiana s soybean crop still has potential to recover some yield after widespread rains offered much needed relief early this month according to purdue extension soybean specialist shaun casteel   beans are flexible and there is a fair amount of growing season left he said we ve had some rainfall and more mild temperatures in early august and if those continue we can still make up ground   corn on the other hand isn t likely to improve much between now and what is all but certain to be an early harvest we need to be prepared for an early harvest because not only was the crop planted early but it also will mature even faster because of drought stress nielsen said  even with short corn and soybean crops hurt said growers could still find themselves in a profitable situation depending on final yields and crop insurance coverage   we assume producers need bushels to have an income he said corn revenues are up 64 percent from what we expected in the spring and soybean revenues are up 24 percent  some growers might have an opportunity to take advantage of the higher prices crop insurance will be another factor we estimate that 65 75 percent of indiana s corn and soybean acres are insured  those compensation dollars will be very large this year also key in final incomes will be growers marketing and forward contracting strategies and whether farms also include livestock hurt said  this year s devastating drought has brought more attention to farming the difficulties farmers face

agricultural communication photo keith robinson  download photo west lafayette ind indiana farmers and livestock producers still can recover from one of the earliest onslaughts of extremely dry conditions in more than two decades but that time is growing short for some purdue university agricultural experts say  while drought so early in the year is drying out crop fields and forages they say it s not time to hit the panic button yet   clearly there are some truly severely stressed regions of the state said bob nielsen extension corn specialist but if you look at the state as a whole the corn has hung in there amazingly well   corn in indiana will begin a crucial period for its development in late june and the first half of july pollination insufficient water during pollination can significantly reduce the amount of corn the crop produces by harvest in the fall  corn in a few fields in southern indiana already has started to pollinate the big concern now is as we approach pollination statewide nielsen said   we can lose an awful lot of yield potential per day with drought stress during pollination although dryness is not uncommon in indiana in the summer it is unusual for drought to hit in the spring as it did this year soon after farmers planted corn and soybeans annually the state s two biggest crops   it is among the earliest onsets of severe dry weather we ve had in at least the last 25 years or so nielsen said farmers and agricultural economists harken to 1988 when a season long drought devastated crops and to 1991 which also saw major reductions in yield because of drought  while only 37 percent of this year s indiana corn crop was rated good to excellent as of june 17 less than 5 percent of the 1988 crop had that rating by then  yields that year ended up 31 percent below the predicted trend yield for that year in 1991 when drought began later in the growing season about 75 percent of the crop was good to excellent in mid june  but by the first week of august it dropped to below 10 percent leading to a crop that was 27 percent below trend crop condition ratings at this point are nowhere as bad as they were in 1988 nielsen said   that s the good news the bad news is that we re already worse than we were in 1991 nielsen said it was still possible for the corn crop to produce yields close to trend but it would need widespread and timely rains now and for the remainder of the season   we don t want a repeat of 88 and 91 he said it s not a disaster yet we still have opportunities to recover there has been yield loss that we won t recover but i don t think it has been dramatic yield loss   agricultural economist chris hurt estimated that dry conditions already could have trimmed 15 bushels of corn per acre in indiana yields relative to the five year trend and projections from early planting  he projects that farmers could produce about 151 bushels per acre down from his estimate of 166 at the start of the growing season  with indiana being a high production state nationally projected yield losses are beginning to move corn prices upward hurt said  and he added it won t take much more damage before we see the corn market start to really light up hurt projects the potential of indiana soybeans to fall to about 45 bushels per acre down from 49 at the start of the season  soybeans that were planted early in the season in april and early may are faring better than those planted in mid may when the dry spell began said extension specialist shaun casteel  but soybeans that have just barely emerged and look stagnant for several days or longer might not be so bad off that is because beans are putting their energy into developing their roots in these dry conditions rather than their shoots casteel said  although soybeans can withstand dry conditions longer than corn he said bean plants that are severely stressed by drought will produce fewer nodes reducing yield   but beans can compensate casteel said if we get timely rains in july or august we can make up a lot of ground with pod retention and seed size  this is provided those plants are at least sustaining themselves during the current dry period indiana has had less rain than normal because of continued high pressure and lack of moisture from the gulf of mexico the state s primary source of moisture according to the indiana state climate office based at purdue  that has lowered humidity to the point where rain from the west can evaporate before reaching the ground compounding the problem is the insufficient moisture indiana received in the winter said state climatologist dev niyogi   entering the growing season we have low soil moistures and reserves to begin with due to the warm winter and the soil continues evaporating and losing water rapidly niyogi said   the rains we may get in parts can help but planning with drought in mind will be a judicious strategy at this point a storm front packing rain was forecast to move into indiana late this week  aside from that niyogi did not expect much to change in the next couple of weeks with dry areas continuing to get drier so unless storms in coming weeks bring good rains we could be in it for the long haul he said  the low humidity has had a positive effect for livestock producers it makes nights cool helping to reduce heat stress in cows  still producers could face reproductive failures in cows this year because of heat stress said extension beef specialist ron lemenager  he said producers should consider pregnancy checking and marketing cull cows earlier than normal to reduce feed needs and to avoid seasonally lower prices that typically occur october to december   if we don t manage cows correctly this year even though we have higher feed costs calf survival and cow herd reproduction can be compromised in year two which results in less calves marketed in year three he said   unfortunately there are no cheap solutions latest developments in crop

aS' purdue physicists part of discovery of new particle that could be higgs boson purdue university professors ian shipsey and daniela bortoletto stand with edinburgh university professors alan walker and peter higgs at cern  purdue scientists were part of the team of scientists who announced on july 4 the discovery of a new particle that may be the higgs boson  higgs is the professor for whom the particle is named and was the first to suggest the particle as the mechanism that gives mass to matter  pictured from left are walker shipsey higgs bortoletto purdue university photo courtesy of bortoletto download photo west lafayette ind   purdue university scientists were part of a historical event this 4th of july as scientists working on the biggest international experiment in particle physics history announced the discovery of a new particle that may be the long sought higgs boson  purdue s particle physics group has been a part of the more than two decade search for the elusive particle which could confirm the standard model of physics and provide insight into how the universe formed  daniela bortoletto the edward purcell distinguished professor of physics and ian shipsey the julian schwinger distinguished professor of physics attended the announcement at the european organization for nuclear research or cern laboratory in geneva switzerland   on a day where fireworks lit up skies across america the world of science unveiled explosive news concerning the longtime elusive higgs boson particle said shipsey who also is the co coordinator of the large hadron collider physics center at fermilab near chicago and was recently elected chair of the compact muon solenoid collaboration board at cern   more data are needed to establish whether this new particle has all the properties of the standard model higgs boson or whether some do not match which would imply new physics beyond the standard model  either way we ve discovered one more key to unlock the mysteries of the universe the announcement was received with cheers during a joint seminar at cern and the ichep conference in melbourne australia  the results came from experiments using the largest machine ever built by mankind the 27 kilometer long large hadron collider or lhc  superconducting magnets that drive the collider are kept at 1 9 kelvins colder than outer space and billions of protons traveling near the speed of light collide at the world record energy of 8 trillion electron volts  the energy of these collisions transforms into tiny subatomic particles which may never have been seen before and some of which live for only one trillionth of one trillionth of a second  the compact muon solenoid is one of three detectors at the lhc that captures traces of these tiny particles it is in essence a 14 000 ton camera the size of a four story office building that almost completely surrounds one section of the collider and takes up to 40 million pictures every second  purdue scientists and students contributed to the design and construction of several key parts of the cms camera the software used to operate camera and analyze the collisions and have contributed to a variety of key measurements with the data  bortoletto and shipsey led the camera design and assembly teams purdue physics professors virgil barnes and laszlo gutay contributed key design features to two major components of the detector the hadron calorimeters which detect showers of particles coming from high energy quarks and the muon detectors which detect heavy relatives of the electron  bortoletto also is the upgrade coordinator of the u s cms and is responsible for coordinating the 47 u s universities working to upgrade the cms camera  in addition purdue physics professors matthew jones david miller and norbert neumeister are part of the international cms team and 20 other purdue personnel including engineers scientists post doctoral researchers graduate students and undergraduates have participated in the experiment  neumeister with close collaboration from purdue s information technology group also is contributing to the global distributed computing system that analyzed the data from the experiments  the purdue cms tier 2 data storage and processing center is the largest one of its kind among u s universities bortoletto has been involved in several of the analyses searching for the higgs boson and neumeister and shipsey have been involved in the internal reviewing process  higgs bosons if they exist are short lived and quickly decay into other particles because scientists cannot look directly for the particle its discovery relies on observations of excess amounts of the particles into which it can decay  however just as making change for a one dollar bill can be done using different combinations of coins higgs bosons can decay into different combinations of particles  bortoletto s group looked for evidence of specific subatomic particles that would result from one possible decay of a higgs boson  an illustration of a particle collision measured by the cms detector image courtesy of cern download photo to avoid any possible bias while analyzing new data and ensure objectivity when looking for much sought after signs of new physics physicists draw blinds over the region where an excess of decay events is expected bortoletto said  this region is only unblinded when they are satisfied enough with their procedures to give confidence in the ultimate result   the moment the analysis was unblinded was amazing bortoletto said the excess at 125 3 gev was easy to see and we felt as though a major discovery was appearing in front of us  the statistical significance achieved was enough to be classified as a discovery the probability of the background alone fluctuating by this amount is one in three million   cms reported observations consistent with expectations for the standard model higgs boson the results were found with a statistical significance of 4 9 sigma a unit of standard deviation which means scientists are 99 99997 percent certain of the discovery  the standard model of particle physics describes the basic building blocks of matter and their interactions and its explanations of elementary particles and forces have held true through more than four decades of experimental testing  the higgs boson remains the only missing piece of the model and without it the critical component of how these particles obtain mass cannot be explained   the standard model higgs would tidily complete the standard model of particles and forces barnes said however the very precise and successful standard model does not explain all that we have observed   it does not give us guidance on how to unify gravity with the other known forces of nature explain why there are exactly three pairs of quarks and three generations of leptons or explain why the third generations are some ten thousand times heavier than the first generations he said   there are some very appealing theories involving a whole host of new particles some of which we are really hoping to find at the lhc barnes said   it is not impossible that our new particle could be for example one of the postulated supersymmetric higgses the higgs boson is named after peter higgs a professor of physics at the university of edinburgh who first suggested the particle as the mechanism that gives mass to matter  shipsey was a graduate student at the university of edinburgh and attended classes taught by higgs this announcement was the first time shipsey had seen higgs in 20 years   peter was a brilliant teacher and all the students were in awe of him shipsey said however he is an extremely modest person and is somewhat embarrassed that the particle carries his name  it was wonderful to see him again and share this moment with him the lhc continues to deliver new data at an impressive rate by the end of 2012 cms hopes to have more than triple its total current data sample  these data will enable cms to further elucidate the nature of this newly observed particle they will also allow cms to extend the reach of their many other searches for new physics bortoletto said  sources ian shipsey 765 409 2979 shipsey purdue edu skype ian shipseydaniela bortoletto cern 011 41 76 487 8773 bortolet purdue edu

aS' purdue president to graduates seek opportunities embrace change west lafayette ind congratulations graduates this is a special day for you for your families and friends and for all of us at purdue who have watched you grow your skills experience confidence and aspirations during your time here  college is indeed a time of transformation if you don t think you ve changed that much just ask your families i m sure they ve marveled at how you ve developed intellectually and socially since they waved good bye and drove away from campus that first year  for those of you who are earning your baccalaureate degrees this summer your earliest days at purdue may seem long ago you probably sat in this same hall at boiler gold rush wondering whether you would be able to fulfill the rigors of college and meet the high standard of excellence that is purdue  the anxious young freshmen who sat here several years ago have grown and today we celebrate as you become the future leaders of our communities and corporations of our academic institutions and our government agencies  we also commemorate our proud graduate students whose hard work has earned them master s doctorate and professional degrees you came here wondering if you could be the great thinkers that your advisers wanted you to be could you keep up with your peers  what if they found out what you were really like i think nearly every student goes through the imposter syndrome for at least a little while  but the purdue experience has changed you too you ve mastered your chosen areas of study you ve created new knowledge made significant advancements through your research and helped design useful tools that will assist others  emily cook has earned a master of science in biomedical engineering her work at purdue will help amputees control their prosthetic devices through a miniaturized radio frequency powered implantable electrode that speaks to targeted muscle sites  arthur chlebowski also in biomedical engineering has earned a doctor of philosophy degree he has designed a device that one day may continuously monitor the intraocular pressure of the eye  this will give ophthalmologists better tools for diagnosing and monitoring patients with glaucoma a disease that is expected to affect nearly 80 million people worldwide over the next 10 years  among you may be a best selling novelist a hotel manager an inspirational teacher a compassionate nurse a cyberforensics genius or a crop scientist who will help farmers around the world gain greater yields from land that struggles to produce  all of our graduates today have learned new levels of confidence independence and responsibility these leadership skills weren t all gained in the classroom  many were learned in the organizations you joined the athletic teams you participated in and the volunteer time you gave to our community  your confidence also came from the enduring love and support of your friends and family let s bring up the house lights so you can wave to your parents siblings grandparents and friends and thank them for all they ve done for you during your purdue years  some of you may have noticed that i ve been through a few changes of my own lately less than a month ago i was provost sands today i am honored to be entrusted with the responsibility of acting president for this extraordinary institution  i ve also been an undergraduate a graduate student an industrial researcher a professor a graduate student adviser in fact two of my students are receiving their doctoral hoods today a research center director and perhaps my most important role the parent of college students all boilermakers by the way two graduated two still here  as i ve moved through the changes of each new role i ve picked up a few tips that i d like to share with you on this special day  you have been taught and mentored by some of the finest faculty in the world internalize the skills and traits that you found effective in them and apply them to your own life  whether you are going on to a faculty position at another university starting a company or joining a fortune 500 corporation you can always draw useful information from the people around you  i encourage you to watch and learn from others who are more experienced and remember someday young people will be learning from you  the researchers in the audience know what i m talking about when i say that sometimes you need to be very patient before you re able to reach your ultimate goal  when it comes to your career it may take a while before you find work that interests you fully the bureau of labor statistics reports that the average person born in the latter years of the baby boom that s 1957 to 1964 held 11 jobs from ages 18 44  that s 11 jobs in 26 years that s a lot of changing and a lot of opportunities we expect that your generation will change jobs just as much if not more  but although change is sometimes tough or even scary every new position can be viewed as a step closer to something you really want to do or an opportunity to make a greater impact  you might graduate from a college that begins with for example the letter p then you might go on to earn a law degree and become a corporate leader somewhere in indiana  perhaps then you ll lead a federal government agency and work for the president of the united states you might go from there to become the governor of a great midwestern state maybe even indiana again  and then who knows someday you might even end up as the president of another university with a name that coincidentally also begins with the letter p and happens to be the greatest institution in the entire country  it could really happen through your life each step over time will lead you closer to something you will love to do something you were meant to do something that will make a bigger difference  be patient and seek the opportunities as they present themselves and when a door opens for you and your immediate reaction is the opportunity is too early too much of a jump or not in the original plan think twice before saying no thanks   don t be afraid to jump in over your head repeatedly it leads to personal growth it helps you refine what type of person you want to be and what you want to do with your career  it often leads to more money or you might even discover that money is not a major criterion for you after all maybe for you it is autonomy or a sense of higher purpose or the opportunity to master your field  and there is something else that is good about change it is something you can count on it will be a constant in your life but as you do remember one thing no matter how many cities you live in or positions you hold or how many times you completely change careers one thing will never change   '

in the school of veterinary medicine and associate director of discovery groups for the purdue center for cancer research also will deliver a keynote lecture on international efforts to prevent breast cancer development to a panel of african health and public policy experts on monday jan  16 in kumasi the incidence of breast cancer has risen rapidly in many african countries and the world health organization is asking scientists from around the world to help shift efforts from detection toward primary prevention said leli vre pronounced le lee yea vre   that s because many developing countries will not be able to withstand the costs associated with the necessary heavy treatments especially since women usually consult at advanced stages of the disease   leli vre and gruenbaum with support from the purdue global policy research institute are researching how legal and cultural aspects impact policy decisions in terms of breast health in countries such as ghana lebanon france japan and uruguay  gruenbaum a medical anthropologist and head of the department of anthropology also will work on establishing a collaboration to study cultural and religious practices affecting breast health and dietary patterns   many african women are dying from breast cancer mainly because of a lack of understanding about the disease s early symptoms and beliefs about the effects of breast cancer gruenbaum said   while the country s fatality rate from breast cancer is 10th highest in africa ghanaian health care officials and government leaders are working aggressively to raise awareness and educate women about how lives can be saved from early screening and treatment   during their visit to ghana leli vre and gruenbaum will meet with african breast cancer awareness leader

and ghana as well as france japan uruguay and lebanon  through the project launched in 2010 each country has a dedicated research team focused on a number of milestones and allows scientists to study worldwide diversity in breast cancer rates dietary patterns and cultural contexts  the project is bringing together experts in nutrition basic medical sciences statistics cancer epidemiology communication public policy economics health law anthropology and medicine to study a variety of factors such as how cellular mechanisms in breast cancer development link to diet as well as the role public policy plays in a population s available food source and disease prevention  leli vre said another important objective is to identify the link between different types of breast cancer nutrition and the epigenome the latter of which determines how the genome is organized within cells to control the on and off switch of genes  the ibcn s annual conference returns to the purdue campus this fall following the 2011 event in france lebanon is scheduled to host the conference in 2013  purdue hosted the inaugural conference in october 2010 purdue s global policy research institute focuses on the

aS' purdue researcher helps robots see in 3 d like humans zygmunt pizlo purdue professor in the department of psychological sciences stands between postdoctoral research assistants tadamasa sawada and yunfeng li as he adjusts the vision of a robot named 268 apek  the researchers will move around the dance floor in pizlo s laboratory while the robot watches the goal is to stimulate visual perception in the robot so it can see more like humans   photo provided by purdue research foundation west lafayette ind zygmunt pizlo and his research team glide across a parquet dance floor not in some club for a night on the town but in his purdue university visual perception lab as part of critical research for a technology that is ready to be licensed and commercialized they re moving so a robot named 268 apek can watch them and conceptualize the research team s actions as members move around objects like desks and chairs  the goal is to simulate visual perception in the robot so it can see more like humans enabling robots and other machines to see the world in 3 d like humans is one of the biggest challenges in robotics and artificial intelligence said pizlo a professor in the purdue department of psychological sciences   research in the field of robotic vision has typically focused on recording and analyzing 2 d images but really it is about 3 d visual perception being able to understand the 3 d scene in front of the robot so that it can decide what needs to be done with an object that is in its field of view  should the robot walk around it pick it up we believe there is a fundamental principle for human vision and that is we rely on a prior knowledge about a physical environment so we re trying to program this knowledge of the physical environment into a robot s artificial intelligence he said   we re developing a technology that will allow robotic machines to map their environment using two cameras for eyes he said this process eliminates the need for additional range sensors currently used for robotic vision and reduces the time and complexity of robotic sight   postdoctoral research assistants tadamasa sawada and yunfeng li are working with pizlo sawada said humans have the ability for cognitive functions that are computationally difficult and it is a challenge to incorporate that ability into a robot  view of zygmunt pizlo purdue professor in the department of psychological sciences and postdoctoral research assistants tadamasa sawada and yunfeng li demonstrating how a robot sees them moving across a dance floor in pizlo s laboratory   photo provided by purdue research foundation we quickly and easily perceive the physical world a 3 d shape and figure ground organization sawada said   figure ground organization is key to seeing an object in 3 d instead of 2 d figure ground perception is the tendency of a human s visual system to simplify a scene or photo into a main object and cognitively move everything else into the background   the question is how do we have a robot solve figure ground organization like we do he said we do this by incorporating visual mechanisms and a prior knowledge about the physical environment into a robot   conventional robotic vision technology uses multiple cameras with laser range finders and other sensors to detect objects around them  while the current systems allow for basic object recognition they do not replicate the 3 d capabilities that are possible for humans according to pizlo   the key element in solving the puzzle of enabling 3 d vision for robots is to realize that our visual system uses a prior knowledge about the physical world  we are implementing this knowledge as well as the visual mechanisms algorithms in a robot said pizlo who also is a professor of electrical and computer engineering   the physical world is not completely random most natural objects are symmetrical all objects have volume gravity is always present ground surfaces are approximately horizontal  there is enough prior knowledge in the human visual system that we automatically see everything in 3 d combining a prior knowledge with visual information helps robots see the same way we do   right now robots are used in a number of ways including manufacturing space research agriculture and even cleaning our floors but they can t bring us coffee in the morning he said   until they can see like us they can t truly interact with us once they can interact with us they can begin doing all types of tasks such as drive a car help surgeons in hospitals assist the elderly provide sight for the blind replace people in high risk situations like making repairs in a nuclear plant and yes bring us coffee in the morning   the patent pending technology is available

rolling out the first initiative of its decadal funding plan with the announcement on wednesday jan  11 that it will proceed with the first steps toward a balanced trimester the trimester is an effort designed to enhance students academic opportunities as well as help them move more quickly toward graduation  president france a c rdova during the announcement at the lumina foundation headquarters said that the balanced trimester initiative is one of several to be unveiled over the next few months in the decadal planning process  purdue s decadal funding plan is a long term commitment to help offset declining state appropriations and reduce tuition increases   we have spent a lot of time thinking through the various elements of the 10 year funding plan she said now that we better understand the costs and returns involved it s time to put these initiatives in motion   beginning this summer the university will expand its summer program offerings as a first step toward implementing a full summer trimester   purdue has moved boldly to become more productive affordable and supportive of students more quickly completing their degrees said indiana gov  mitch daniels this is how leaders act offering a third semester each year will help some students complete a nominal four year degree in as little as three years saving them time and money and it will give others the chance to take advantage of study abroad and internship opportunities  when fully implemented the trimester initiative could mean 40 million in additional revenue for the university and would make better use of classrooms residence halls and other campus facilities during the summer months   this initiative will make a purdue education more affordable because a greater array of summer course and program offerings combined with discounted summer tuition will result in a faster time to completion for some students said tim sands provost and executive vice president for academic affairs  purdue s fall and spring tuition schedule for the main campus in west lafayette is already designed to encourage full course loads by offering credits above eight for no additional charge  in addition students taking from eight to 16 credits in the summer receive a discount relative to fall and spring rates that discount is as high as 50 percent for students who take eight or nine credits in the summer  in embarking on this more aggressive efficiency and opportunity initiative purdue is exploring ideas for further incentives course packages and scholarships along with financial models that encourage departments to implement summer academic programs to jump start the trimester initiative  purdue president france a c rdova speaks wednesday jan 11 during an indianapolis news conference at the lumina foundation to announce the university will proceed with the first steps toward a balanced trimester   purdue university photo mark simons download photo purdue s decision to move toward a full summer trimester offers students expanded opportunities to accelerate graduation and save money and is aligned with the commission s goals of increasing completion and ensuring affordability said teresa lubbers indiana commissioner for higher education  jamie merisotis lumina foundation president and ceo said lumina foundation is honored to host the announcement of purdue s new trimester effort  we applaud purdue university and president c rdova s plan to accelerate the time to degree this is an innovative approach and reflects a strong commitment to serving students and the state of indiana   the project is a key part of the decadal funding plan to increase sources of revenue beyond tuition and state appropriations the traditional sources for public university funding by doubling revenue capacity through continued cost cutting expanding online degree and professional education offerings encouraging more robust use of campus facilities through summer teaching and learning and ramping up research commercialization  purdue trustee joann brouillette said the trimester effort was attractive to trustees because it would benefit students and the university s bottom line   the advantages for students are several and it helps the university financially while making better use of buildings and equipment she said   the additional revenue will help cut our cost per credit hour c rdova said we ve made a commitment to students and the state legislature that purdue will do everything possible to keep tuition affordable and still deliver an exceptional education and a valuable degree   currently 6 000 students take summer classes at purdue s main campus for an average of four to five credit hours each the goal is to grow the summer trimester to more than 20 000 students by 2022  although savings for students and the institution would accrue from year round utilization of facilities expenses also would grow with additional pay needed for professors and support staff  financial aid also would need attention since most programs typically cover only two semesters in an academic year one option for additional indiana student support will be purdue s indiana challenge scholarship program  c rdova announced this summer that 7 million earned through university investments would be used to boost private donations for student support with 300 000 dedicated to support veterans and their dependents and 6 7 million for the scholarship matching program  the purdue indiana challenge match will contribute to the access and success student scholarship and programming

aS' rap music powers rhythmic action of medical sensor this graphic illustrates the principles behind the operation of a new type of miniature medical sensor powered by acoustic waves including those found in music such as rap blues jazz and rock  the device a pressure sensor might ultimately help to treat people stricken with aneurisms or incontinence due to paralysis birck nanotechnology center purdue university  download photo west lafayette ind the driving bass rhythm of rap music can be harnessed to power a new type of miniature medical sensor designed to be implanted in the body  acoustic waves from music particularly rap were found to effectively recharge the pressure sensor such a device might ultimately help to treat people stricken with aneurisms or incontinence due to paralysis  the heart of the sensor is a vibrating cantilever a thin beam attached at one end like a miniature diving board music within a certain range of frequencies from 200 500 hertz causes the cantilever to vibrate generating electricity and storing a charge in a capacitor said babak ziaie a purdue university professor of electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering   the music reaches the correct frequency only at certain times for example when there is a strong bass component he said the acoustic energy from the music can pass through body tissue causing the cantilever to vibrate   when the frequency falls outside of the proper range the cantilever stops vibrating automatically sending the electrical charge to the sensor which takes a pressure reading and transmits data as radio signals  because the frequency is continually changing according to the rhythm of a musical composition the sensor can be induced to repeatedly alternate intervals of storing charge and transmitting data   you would only need to do this for a couple of minutes every hour or so to monitor either blood pressure or pressure of urine in the bladder ziaie said   it doesn t take long to do the measurement findings are detailed in a paper to be presented during the ieee mems conference which will be jan  29 to feb 2 in paris the paper was written by doctoral student albert kim research scientist teimour maleki and ziaie researchers have created a new type of miniature pressure sensor shown here designed to be implanted in the body  acoustic waves from music or plain tones drive a vibrating device called a cantilever generating a charge to power the sensor birck nanotechnology center purdue university  download photo this paper demonstrates the feasibility of the concept he said the device is an example of a microelectromechanical system or mems and was created in the birck nanotechnology center at the university s discovery park  the cantilever beam is made from a ceramic material called lead zirconate titanate or pzt which is piezoelectric meaning it generates electricity when compressed  the sensor is about 2 centimeters long researchers tested the device in a water filled balloon a receiver that picks up the data from the sensor could be placed several inches from the patient  playing tones within a certain frequency range also can be used instead of music but a plain tone is a very annoying sound ziaie said   we thought it would be novel and also more aesthetically pleasing to use music researchers experimented with four types of music rap blues jazz and rock   rap is the best because it contains a lot of low frequency sound notably the bass ziaie said the sensor is capable of monitoring pressure in the urinary bladder and in the sack of a blood vessel damaged by an aneurism  such a technology could be used in a system for treating incontinence in people with paralysis by checking bladder pressure and stimulating the spinal cord to close the sphincter that controls urine flow from the bladder  more immediately it could be used to diagnose incontinence the conventional diagnostic method now is to insert a probe with a catheter which must be in place for several hours while the patient remains at the hospital   a wireless implantable device could be inserted and left in place allowing the patient to go home while the pressure is monitored ziaie said  the new technology offers potential benefits over conventional implantable devices which either use batteries or receive power through a property called inductance which uses coils on the device and an external transmitter  both approaches have downsides batteries have to be replaced periodically and data are difficult to retrieve from devices that use inductance coils on the implanted device and an external receiver must be lined up precisely and they can only be about a centimeter apart  a patent application has been filed for the design

and implementation of a novel electromechanical energy scavenging and wireless interrogation scheme using low frequency components of musical vibrations to overcome challenges associated with previously reported passive transponders such as short transmission range misalignment sensitivity and complicated receiver circuitry  the transponder has two phases of operation 1 mechanical vibration phase in which an acoustic receiver a piezoelectric cantilever converts the sound vibration into electrical power and charges a capacitor and 2 electrical radiation phase in which the stored charge is dumped into an lc tank forcing it to oscillate at its natural resonance frequency and emitting the energy to an outside receiver  in a pressure sensing configuration the distance between a planar coil and a ferrite core is modulated by the pressure thus changing the inductance and in turn inducing a change in the frequency of the emitted signal  a prototype transponder was built and tested using a pzt cantilever with a mechanical resonant frequency of 435 hz encapsulated in a glass capsule length 40 mm diameter 8 mm along with a rectifier circuitry and a storage capacitor  the inductive pressure sensor located outside the capsule had a sensitivity of 2 5k hz kpa we were able to easily pick up the transmitted rf pulses at distances of up to 7 cm without the tight requirement on alignment between the receiver and the transponder coils   '

aS' rapidly cooling eggs can double shelf life decrease risk of illness kevin keener developed a rapid egg cooling system that uses circulated carbon dioxide to create a thin layer of ice inside an egg s shell that cools the inside of an egg within minutes strengthening proteins and increasing shelf life   purdue agricultural communication file photo keith robinson west lafayette ind taking just a few seconds to cool freshly laid eggs would add weeks to their shelf life according to a purdue university study  the rapid cooling process developed by kevin keener a professor of food science uses liquid carbon dioxide to stabilize the proteins in egg whites so much that they could be rated aa the highest grade for eggs for 12 weeks  earlier research showed that the same cooling technology could significantly reduce occurrences of salmonella illnesses there is no statistical difference in quality between eggs as measured by haugh units just after laying and rapidly cooled eggs at 12 weeks he said   this rapid cooling process can provide a significant extension in the shelf life of eggs compared to traditional processing keener s results published in the journal poultry science also show that membranes surrounding the eggs yolks were maintained for 12 weeks when eggs were rapidly cooled  that membrane is a barrier that keeps harmful bacteria from reaching the yolk a nutrient rich reservoir that bacteria could use as a food source   the structural integrity of the yolk membrane stays strong longer which may provide a food safety benefit he said the membrane being stronger would be another defense against bacterial invasion such as salmonella   the rapid cooling technology takes liquid carbon dioxide and turns it into a snow to rapidly lower the eggs temperature eggs are placed in a cooling chamber and carbon dioxide gas at about minus 110 degrees fahrenheit is generated  the cold gas is circulated around the eggs and forms a thin layer of ice inside the eggshell after treatment the ice layer melts and quickly lowers an egg s internal temperature to below 45 degrees the temperature at which salmonella can no longer grow  keener s previous research showed that the carbon dioxide in bicarbonate form significantly increases the activity of lysozyme an enzyme in the egg white that has bactericidal properties  traditionally eggs are at more than 100 degrees when placed into a carton thirty dozen eggs are then packed in a case and 30 cases are stacked onto pallets and placed in refrigerated coolers  the eggs in the middle of the pallet can take up to 142 hours nearly six days to cool to 45 degrees keener said keener said a 2005 u s  government report showed that if eggs were cooled and stored at 45 degrees within 12 hours of laying there would be about 100 000 fewer salmonella illnesses from eggs in the nation each year  rapid cooling could also increase the ability to export eggs to places where this isn t possible today you could send eggs anywhere in the world if you could get even eight weeks of shelf life at aa quality  we re seeing 12 weeks keener said right now you can t ship eggs anywhere in the world and expect to retain that quality keener said with additional funding he would continue to study the benefits of rapid cooling including inoculating the inside of shell eggs with salmonella and examining how other proteins in the whites and yolks of eggs are affected  keener is a technical consultant to the american egg board and a member of the united egg producers scientific advisory panel his work was funded by purdue and gift funds  maximizing carbon dioxide content of shell eggs by rapid cooling treatment and its effect on shell egg quality rapid cooling of shell eggs using liquid co 2 has been shown to cool eggs to 7 c within minutes as opposed to days required by traditional cooling treatments this quick cooling technique is component in the maintenance of egg quality and extended shelf life beyond the current 30 45 d period  the hypothesis for the current study was that maximizing co2 content of the eggs during cooling may increase haugh units and thus extend shelf life physical quality factors  the objective of this study was to maximize co2 content of shell eggs during rapid cooling with liquid co2 and determine its effect on egg quality during 12 wk of refrigerated storage  three cooling conditions selected for the study were 45 c for 18 min treatment a 60 c for 15 min treatment b and 75 c for 12 min treatment c  after rapid cooling treatment it took approximately 25 min for the internal temperature of eggs to equilibrate to 7 c the haugh units of the rapidly cooled eggs were significantly higher than the traditionally cooled control eggs  after 12 wk of refrigerated 5 7 c storage control eggs were only 37 aa grade 57 a grade and 6 b grade in comparison all the rapidly cooled eggs averaged to 80 aa grade and 20 a grade  after 6 wk the average quality of control eggs reduced to grade a whereas rapid cooling treatment was able to maintain aa quality up to 12 wk  the co2 content of the rapidly cooled eggs 1 8 mg of co2 g of albumen showed no difference between treatments a b and c but it was significantly higher than the control 1 3 mg of co 2 g of albumen in addition the vitelline membrane strength of the control decreased 65 during storage and was between 30 and 50 of the vitelline membrane strength of co 2 cooled eggs at 12 wk rapid cooling with liquid co2 extends shelf life of shell eggs '

aS' reduced cattle herd could mean bigger profits starting late 2013 west lafayette ind the u s beef herd has been shrinking and the worst drought in decades has only encouraged that trend to continue  but for beef producers who can withstand the financial hardship over the next several months reduced beef supplies could mean bigger profits starting as early as late 2013  the u s department of agriculture s midyear cattle inventory report showed beef cow numbers dropped by 3 percent in the last year  it projects the 2012 calf crop to be down 2 percent from last year and down 8 percent since 2006 part of what has been driving the decline is skyrocketing feed costs and prolonged drought in the southern plains said chris hurt purdue extension agricultural economist   this year s drought likely means further decreases in cow numbers over the next 12 14 months he said the impacts of the drought are just beginning to show up in some of the national data  we do know the direction but not the final magnitude since mid june corn prices have jumped by 60 percent and soybean meal prices by 25 percent  and according to the usda 82 92 percent of the pastures in indiana illinois arkansas missouri iowa kansas nebraska and colorado are in very poor or poor condition  the lack of available feed crops and forages and the high prices for what is available have forced many producers to start culling their herds  as more cattle have entered the market the value of calves and feeder cattle has fallen in the wake of high feed prices and uncertainty regarding forage availability calf and feeder cattle prices plummeted hurt said  for example oklahoma steer calf prices were 173 per hundredweight in mid june but fell to 138 in late july a 35 per hundredweight decline on a 550 pound calf is a nearly 200 per head value reduction   multiplying that across a national calf crop of 34 5 million head totals a potential decline in value of nearly 7 billion he said   it is still too early to count the actual damages but this illustration shows it s likely large the silver lining hurt said could be for producers who are able to weather the financial storm and hold onto their herds  as cattle numbers fall below beef consumer demand prices should rebound producers likely best positioned to keep their herds are those who locked in lower feed prices in the spring  that would mostly include large feedlots that tend to hedge on feed and feed cost and profit margins the message for cow calf producers is to hold onto the cows if possible hurt said   the short term losses of the next 12 to 14 months will be replaced by large profits in late 2013 2014 and 2015 hurt said the anticipated golden days are based on reductions in per capita beef supplies leading to higher retail beef prices and an expected return to more normal crop conditions in 2013  while that could revive some optimism in the cattle industry hurt was quick to point out that most thoughts of herd expansion would be pushed off until late 2013   the exception is for producers in areas of the country that have abundant forages he said for them buying cows sold this fall from distressed owners appears to be a strategic move   '

medications insulin and cancer treatments  today an estimated 2 million infusion pumps are in hospitals and clinics and thousands more are used by patients in their homes  the pumps come with a programmable computer to control the rate and volume of medication flow which can vary depending on the patient s illness weight age and other factors  a doctor nurse or other health care worker enters information on the infusion pump s keypad despite their advantages the fda reports that infusion pumps were linked to more than 56 000 adverse event reports from 2005 2009 including at least 500 deaths  cindy gaston senior clinical pharmacist for the university of wisconsin hospital clinics in madison says the purdue led community has been helpful in sparking discussion from hospital personnel in different environments who have diverse experiences and different vantage points   we re all human and we make mistakes gaston says when we re programming numbers into a pump we can make an error many times those errors won t cause patient harm but it can be one or two times that it does cause severe patient harm ultimately resulting in death   if we can prevent those deaths and improve our use of infusion pumps it s a very worthwhile project that purdue is leading in 2010 the u s  food and drug administration released guidelines designed to improve safety as part of its infusion pump improvement initiative which proposed stricter regulation of pumps and cited software defects user interface issues and mechanical or electrical failures as main causes of adverse events  infusion pump manufacturers say most problems stem from a nurse or health care worker accidentally entering the wrong data but the fda and hospital officials say the deaths and injuries were because of engineering and design defects of the devices  that was the driving force behind regenstrief s efforts to create the group to examine the problems with smart pumps and find solutions  beverly vermace parental infusion device coordinator and a registered nurse at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics says the purdue network has allowed her hospital system to work through existing hurdles encountered with the use of smart pumps while being proactive in avoiding potential hurdles learned from other hospitals   with all health care technology we cannot remove the human element vermace says technology needs to be designed to allow the clinician to do safe patient care  when that happens patient outcomes will improve a team led by ann christine catlin a research scientist in

tutorials q a forums and other educational and research resources all accessible via a web page  jim young quality assurance process improvement pharmacist at wishard says that through the group led by purdue hospitals can share individual processes for getting a better understanding about how to set guidelines and limits for dosages and concentrations of medication  young whose hospital system began using wireless infusion pumps in 2010 says pharmacists can learn a lot about their proper use by talking to the nurses and vice versa   the interaction with this community is helping us improve that communication process to make sure we can give our patients the best possible care he says   we re writing the textbook here through the interactions with this community of hospitals vermace at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics says the community also provides a form of encouragement for hospital administrators and staff who know other hospitals have similar issues and are committed to find solutions   we get good ideas such as what has worked from the lessons learned why pharmacists and nurses must work together more effectively she says   another advantage is the rapid response to questions asked and immediate contact with people with a shared experience kathy rapala is now vice president of clinical risk management at aurora health care in wisconsin  she first began looking into ways to address the infusion pump problem for hospital staff while pursuing her doctorate of nursing practice at purdue in 2008  through the indianapolis coalition for patient safety she submitted a grant to cardinal health with the vision of linking the smart pump databases of the indianapolis hospitals   it s exciting when an idea takes off rapala says to work with data on one platform with diverse organizations is a great step forward in understanding a device and the interaction with the care environment  the learning environment that purdue has created around the data platform will further that understanding and research community participants say they are convinced a continued focus on this national patient safety issue building on the research and data collection under way at purdue will give hospitals the necessary tools to improve use of infusion pumps spark ideas to improve the use of guardrails on the devices minimize alerts and grow their acceptance   the stakes are high wishard s young says this community established by purdue s regenstrief center and involving these many hospitals is helping us improve our patient safety measures and

aS' report corn ethanol waiver s effect on corn prices uncertain west lafayette ind corn prices pushed higher by the worst u s drought in half a century would not necessarily moderate if the federal government s corn ethanol mandate were temporarily suspended according to a report by purdue university agricultural economists the report potential impacts of a partial waiver of the ethanol blending rules suggests that corn prices could fall under some scenarios should the u s  environmental protection agency grant a partial waiver of the renewable fuel standard s corn ethanol provision but only under certain market conditions  the epa received a request by a consortium of livestock industry organizations to waive part of the mandate that effectively requires corn ethanol be blended with gasoline  the purdue report will be available wednesday aug 15 on the farm foundation website at http www farmfoundation org farm foundation nfp is an oak brook ill   based not for profit organization conducting public policy education for food agriculture and rural communities the authors will discuss their report during a live webcast thursday aug  16 a waiver could under certain conditions reduce the demand for corn and thus corn prices for livestock producers and other non ethanol corn buyers  under its normal schedule the epa has until october to gather information on the extent of any economic harm done by the original renewable fuel standard level and to decide if it will issue a waiver  for consumers the decision could affect what they pay for fuel and food the range of impact of an rfs waiver goes from zero to 1 30 per bushel for corn said wally tyner an energy policy specialist and the report s lead author  with corn crops shriveling in the field and yield projections dropping almost weekly corn prices have jumped 60 percent since june 15  a bushel of corn has topped 8 the prospect of a diminished crop and even higher corn prices has livestock producers worried that corn might not be available or will be too expensive to buy  corn is a feed mainstay for most livestock operations this year the rfs mandates oil companies blend 13 2 billion gallons of ethanol with the gasoline they produce  the mandate increases to 13 8 billion gallons in 2013 because oil companies blended 2 6 billion gallons of ethanol with gasoline above what was required in previous years they have built up blending credits known as renewable identification numbers or rins allowing them to count those gallons toward blending totals in this or future years  in the purdue study tyner along with fellow agricultural economists chris hurt and farzad taheripour looked at future corn and ethanol prices with and without an rfs waiver how rins and crude oil prices could factor in ethanol use and what might occur if the drought worsens   if corn prices remain high which seems likely and crude oil remains at 100 a barrel or lower then reducing the rfs could reduce the demand for ethanol and consequently the demand for corn tyner said   if the waiver resulted in less demand for ethanol that would in turn lead to lower corn prices than would have existed without the waiver  it also could lead to more ethanol plant closings at least temporarily conversely an epa waiver could have little effect if crude oil moves beyond 120 a barrel and oil companies continue blending ethanol at current levels tyner said  the severity of drought moving forward adds another layer of complexity to the issue the purdue economists said at the start of the crop season u s  corn production was projected at 14 7 billion bushels at a u s farm price of 5 34 per bushel the usda now estimates u s corn production will reach only 10 8 billion bushels this year at 8 20 a bushel  should the drought strengthen and the epa sticks to the mandated 13 8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2013 a corn crop of 10 5 billion bushels could push corn prices to 8 57 per bushel according to the purdue report  if drought conditions abate and corn production reaches 11 5 billion bushels corn prices could fall to 7 02 a bushel under a full rfs ethanol mandate   however because of carry forward blending credits from prior years the rins refiners and blenders could decide to produce and blend 2 billion fewer gallons of ethanol tyner said   that change alone could reduce the price of corn around 67 cents a bushel and that is without any epa waiver it will have to determine what impact issuance of a waiver actually would have given the way the market functions at present he said   for technical and economic reasons refiners may well continue to use nearly the same amount of ethanol even if they are not required to because of a waiver  technically they may not want to change their current mix of gasoline and ethanol to make 87 octane gasoline as an example economically they would not be expected to reduce ethanol use as long as ethanol prices are below gasoline as they are now  if refiners and blenders don t have or choose not to use operating flexibility and if reduced use of ethanol is not economical then a waiver would have no impact   to the extent that refiners and blenders do have flexibility with their use of ethanol a small waiver could reduce corn prices around 47 cents a bushel while a large waiver could reduce it as much as 1 30 a bushel depending on economic conditions   should a waiver lead to reduced ethanol use the epa could have an influence on who bears the brunt of the drought related corn losses tyner said   the total amount of harm from the drought is in the tens of billions of dollars he said the epa cannot change the loss it can only potentially redistribute it among the affected parties ethanol producers livestock producers corn

aS' research fungicides helpful when diseases are present west lafayette ind applying fungicides to soybeans free of foliar disease problems isn t likely to help alleviate drought stress and could contribute to fungicide resistant diseases says a purdue extension plant pathologist  soybean growers probably are feeling pressure to apply fungicides as the crop enters the r3 growth stage regardless of disease presence based on claims that the products can reduce drought stress increase photosynthesis and ultimately increase yields   we ve done research on fungicides in the absence of disease for several years now at purdue what we ve found is that when we don t have disease pressure there foliar diseases such as frogeye leaf spot or cercospora leaf blight we don t often see an economic benefit from a fungicide application kiersten wise said   we know that with soybean prices what they are that benefit would be something to really capitalize on this year but we just don t see a consistent response so it makes it very hard to recommend those fungicides in the absence of disease   many foliar diseases struggle to develop in hot dry weather so this year s excessive heat and drought have kept most at bay in fields that aren t irrigated and haven t had much rainfall  in addition to the lack of profitability wise said applying unnecessary fungicides also could lead to fungicide resistant diseases  one example is frogeye leaf spot a major disease of soybeans that already has resistant populations in five midwestern and southern states   one of the big drawbacks to using fungicides for these plant health benefits is that when we use the same mode of action over and over again we select for fungicide resistant strains of the fungus wise said   our standard recommendation is that fungicides should be applied only when foliar disease pressure is potentially yield limiting   more information and research results are available via purdue extension s aug 3 pest and crop newsletter in wise s article fungicide applications in soybean risk vs  reward at http extension entm purdue edu pestcrop 2012 issue19 index html fungicide'

aS' researcher s fish eye view could offer insights for human vision west lafayette ind a purdue university student s research project related to zebrafish eye development could lead to a better understanding of vision problems that affect billions of people worldwide  zeran li as an undergraduate student in biological sciences led a research team that uncovered an enzyme s role in the regulation of eye size in the fish  if the enzyme s role is similar in human eyes it could be relevant to human vision problems such as nearsightedness and farsightedness   new insights into the process of eye size control in zebrafish may help our understanding of the regulation of eye size in humans said li who has since graduated and is pursuing a doctorate in neuroscience at washington university   vision problems occur when the size or shape of the eye changes and what causes this is unclear perhaps this research will lead to a better understanding of this mechanism and the discovery of a new treatment for these problems   these vision problems called refractive errors occur because the physical length of the eye from the cornea to the retina is different from the optical length  if an eye is too long or too short light is focused in front of or behind the retina and vision is blurred she said refractive errors affect 3 8 billion people worldwide according to the international center for eye education  li worked in the laboratory of yuk fai leung a purdue assistant professor of biological sciences leung oversaw the research and guided the team but credits the two undergraduate students in his lab for the idea   the inspiration for this study came from the undergraduate students he said their observations and interpretations helped shape our current focus and allowed us to make this discovery  i m very proud of the scientists they are becoming the findings are detailed in a paper in plos one in addition to li and leung paper co authors include purdue undergraduate student devon ptak postdoctoral researchers liyun zhang and wenxuan zhong and continuing lecturer elwood walls  zebrafish are used as a model to study development and growth problems the zebrafish which are named for their naturally occurring black stripes must be made transparent to enable the careful observation and imaging necessary for the research  the most common way to achieve this transparency is to treat zebrafish embryos with a chemical called phenylthiourea that blocks the formation of black pigment he said  li had previously observed that zebrafish embryos treated with the chemical have smaller eyes than untreated fish and found that in addition to blocking pigmentation the chemical inhibits thyroid activity  the thyroid produces hormones that regulate metabolism and influence growth and it was thought that a general suppression of the thyroid hormone could be causing the reduction in eye size  li theorized that phenylthiourea might suppress thyroid hormone production because it shares the same structure as a known thyroid hormone inhibitor  she tested the effects of several different inhibitors and found that not all had the same effect on eye growth only those that halted production of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase resulted in smaller eye size   if thyroid peroxidase has a specific role in the regulation of eye growth it would be logical for it to express in the eye leung said   perhaps a localized manipulation of its activity in the eye could be used as a strategy to correct some vision problems of course first we must learn much more about how it regulates eye size   the findings also serve as a warning of the potential changes phenylthiourea may have on zebrafish a widely used animal model that could affect research results he said   our findings and others have shown that phenylthiourea can affect various aspects of physiology so the results obtained from fish treated with it may not truly reflect what is going on inside the embryo leung said   one should be cautious in interpreting their findings after phenylthiourea treatment this discovery highlights the need to find a new way to remove pigmentation   leung s group attempted to find an alternative inhibitor for pigmentation but all caused physiological problems and none were as efficient as phenylthiourea he said  the team plans to further investigate the relationship of thyroid peroxidase and thyroid hormone on eye growth and development  leung said the team also is analyzing the effects of traditional chinese medicines considered good for vision using fish models of human retinal degeneration   hopefully our efforts will expedite the discovery of novel treatments for human eye diseases he said li and ptak received national sigma xi awards for vision research  li also was a recipient of a sandy and zippy ostroy research experience for undergraduates award and a dr william h phillips undergraduate research internship  in addition to those awards this research was funded by grants from the national science foundation and u s department of energy  phenylthiourea ptu is commonly used for inhibiting melanization of zebrafish embryos in this study the standard treatment with 0 2 mm ptu was demonstrated to specifically reduce eye size in larval fish starting at three days post fertilization  this effect is likely the result of a reduction in retinal and lens size of ptu treated eyes and is not related to melanization inhibition  this is because the eye size of tyr a genetic mutant of tyrosinase whose activity is inhibited in ptu treatment was not reduced  as ptu contains a thiocarbamide group which is presented in many goitrogens suppressing thyroid hormone production is a possible mechanism by which ptu treatment may reduce eye size  despite the fact that thyroxine level was found to be reduced in ptu treated larvae thyroid hormone supplements did not rescue the eye size reduction  instead treating embryos with six goitrogens including inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase tpo and sodium iodide symporter nis suggested an alternative possibility  specifically three tpo inhibitors including those that do not possess thiocarbamide specifically reduced eye size whereas none of the nis inhibitors could elicit this effect  these observations indicate that tpo inhibition rather than a general suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis is likely the underlying cause of ptu induced eye size reduction  furthermore the tissue specific effect of ptu treatment might be mediated by an eye specific tpo expression compared with treatment with other tyrosinase inhibitors or bleaching to remove melanization ptu treatment remains the most effective approach  thus one should use caution when interpreting results that are obtained from ptu treated embryos '

aS' researchers sorghum should be in the mix as a biofuel crop west lafayette ind sweet and biomass sorghum would meet the need for next generation biofuels to be environmentally sustainable easily adopted by producers and take advantage of existing agricultural infrastructure a group of researchers led by purdue university scientists believes  the scientists from purdue the university of nebraska lincoln university of illinois and cornell university believe sorghum a grain crop similar to corn could benefit from the rail system grain elevators and corn ethanol processing facilities already in place  their perspective article is published early online in the journal biofuels bioproducts biorefining the midwest is uniquely poised to get the biorefining industry going on cellulose said nick carpita a purdue professor of botany and plant pathology   as we move to different fuels beyond ethanol the ethanol plants of today are equipped to take advantage of new bioenergy crops   the scientists argue that no single plant is a silver bullet answer to biofuels but sorghum should be a larger part of the conversation than it is today  cliff weil a purdue professor of agronomy said some types of sorghum would require fewer inputs and could be grown on marginal lands   in the near future we need a feedstock that is not corn weil said sweet and biomass sorghum meet all the criteria they use less nitrogen grow well and grow where other things don t grow   the ability to minimize inputs such as nitrogen could be a key to sorghum s benefits as a bioenergy crop carpita said corn which has been bred to produce a maximum amount of seed requires a lot of nitrogen  but sorghum could be genetically developed in a way that maximizes cellulose minimizes seeds and therefore minimizes inputs   if you re just producing biomass and not seed you don t need as much nitrogen carpita said farmers may also be more willing to grow sorghum a crop they re familiar with because it is an annual compared with perennials such as switchgrass or miscanthus that would take up a field for a decade or longer  sorghum would fit in a normal crop rotation with food crops rather than tying up valuable cropland if we re talking about planting switchgrass that s a 15 year commitment said nathan mosier a purdue associate professor of agricultural and biological engineering   you can t switch annually based on the economy or other factors you are committed to that crop conversion processes for turning biomass into fuel need to be scalable and take advantage of existing infrastructure for grain production said maureen mccann a purdue professor of biology and director of the energy center and the center for direct catalytic conversion of biomass to biofuels sorghum could be harvested and transported using existing rail lines to collection points such as grain elevators where the crop could be processed to a higher value more energy dense product before being transported for further processing in a refinery   biomass has roughly half the energy content of gasoline even if it s very compressed and tightly packed the issue is really how to increase the intrinsic energy density by preprocessing conversion steps that could be done on farm or at the silo so that you re transporting higher energy products to the refineries mccann said  farzad taheripour a purdue research assistant professor of agricultural economics said bringing sorghum back as a biofuel crop could have an economic impact on poorer rural areas of the country   given that sorghum can be produced on low quality marginal lands in dry areas producing sorghum for biofuel will significantly improve the economy of rural areas that rely on low productivity agriculture taheripour said   this could improve welfare in less developed rural areas and increase job opportunities in these areas purdue agriculture researchers are continuing to look at how bioenergy crops could be deployed into the agricultural landscape  work in the center for direct catalytic conversion of biomass to biofuels continues to develop a knowledge base for chemical and thermal conversion technologies that might be able to take advantage of the midwest s transportation infrastructure  ismail dweikat clifford weil stephen moose leon kochian nathan mosier klein ileleji patrick brown wendy peer angus murphy farzad taheripour maureen mccann nicholas carpita corn grain ethanol production is a mature industry built on a midwestern agricultural infrastructure second and third generation biofuels and bio based products industries could take advantage of this robust framework  significant but not insurmountable barriers remain for grower acceptance of bioenergy crop plants and capital investment in transitioning from grain to lignocellulosic biomass at scale  the existing infrastructure in the midwest provides a model for implementing an environmentally responsible and sustainable next generation biofuels industry into the agro economy   '

aS' restaurant smoking bans help snuff out european youth smoking west lafayette ind teenagers and young adults are less likely to smoke when faced with restaurant smoking bans and minimum tobacco purchase ages in europe according to new research by a purdue university sociologist   policies that restrict smoking directly affect young people s behavior and that may be a key element to curb smoking rates because most adult smokers report starting when they were teenagers says mike vuolo an assistant professor of sociology who studies youth behavior   in countries with restaurant smoking bans young people were 35 percent less likely to smoke regularly most studies look at individual factors such as income and education levels and smoking rates but this study also examined policies and other social influences such as antismoking messages in mass media and cigarette taxes  the article is published in a recent issue of social forces the results are based on self reported cigarette use of people ages 15 24 in the original 15 european union countries and the data is from eurostat the european commission s statistics branch and the world health organization  the survey information was collected in the spring of 2002 and there were 7 532 respondents with an average of 450 respondents per country   enforcing a law certainly plays a role in influencing behavior vuolo said while the bans and policies create a physical obstacle to smoking they also add a stigma that likely contributes to deterring young people from the habit   the study also found that local taxes and anti tobacco campaigns were less effective in reducing smoking than bans and age limits   strategies that rely on a personal cost or a cry to change behavior such as taxes or anti smoking posters weren t as likely to curb cigarette use as policies do he said   however a long term study that looks at the impact of each effort is needed to better understand how sociological factors contribute to individual behavior   because the 18 year old minimum purchase age in the united states is universal this finding is not as applicable as in europe when at the time of the 2002 data collection the restricted ages varied by regions  at that time six countries had no minimum purchase age three countries required consumers to be 18 and six countries required age 16  in countries with no minimum purchase age the probability of a young person smoking regularly was about 46 percent compared to 30 percent in countries with age restrictions   considering that most adult smokers start smoking when they are teenagers these laws and bans can be a first step to discouraging young people from smoking he said  note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the journal article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service at 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu abstract placing deviance in a legal and logical context a multilevel analysis of cigarette use in the european union though it has produced a high quality body of research the study of substance use has remained highly individualized in its focus  this paper adds further sociological understanding to that research using hierarchical methods the following explores how institutional and criminological theories can be incorporated into substance use research by examining cigarette smoking at three levels of variation  two main findings emerge first national legal context plays a role in understanding individual level probabilities of substance use even after controlling for individual and local characteristics  for example lower probabilities of smoking occur where there are smoking bans and minimum purchase ages second the effects of local context such as unemployment and the percentage of young people exhibit significant effects of individual level cigarette use   '

aS' sensor detects glucose in saliva and tears for diabetes testing these color enhanced scanning electron microscope images show nanosheets resembling tiny rose petals the nanosheets are key components of a new type of biosensor that can detect minute concentrations of glucose in saliva tears and urine  the technology might eventually help to eliminate or reduce the frequency of using pinpricks for diabetes testing purdue university photo jeff goecker  download photo west lafayette ind researchers have created a new type of biosensor that can detect minute concentrations of glucose in saliva tears and urine and might be manufactured at low cost because it does not require many processing steps to produce   it s an inherently non invasive way to estimate glucose content in the body said jonathan claussen a former purdue university doctoral student and now a research scientist at the u s  naval research laboratory because it can detect glucose in the saliva and tears it s a platform that might eventually help to eliminate or reduce the frequency of using pinpricks for diabetes testing  we are proving its functionality claussen and purdue doctoral student anurag kumar led the project working with timothy fisher  a purdue professor of mechanical engineering d marshall porterfield a professor of agricultural and biological engineering and other researchers at the university s birck nanotechnology center  findings are detailed in a research paper being published this week in the journal advanced functional materials most sensors typically measure glucose in blood claussen said   many in the literature aren t able to detect glucose in tears and the saliva what s unique is that we can sense in all four different human serums the saliva blood tears and urine  and that hasn t been shown before the paper featured on the journal s cover was written by claussen kumar fisher porterfield and purdue researchers david b  jaroch m haseeb khawaja and allison b hibbard the sensor has three main parts layers of nanosheets resembling tiny rose petals made of a material called graphene which is a single atom thick film of carbon platinum nanoparticles and the enzyme glucose oxidase  each petal contains a few layers of stacked graphene the edges of the petals have dangling incomplete chemical bonds defects where platinum nanoparticles can attach  electrodes are formed by combining the nanosheet petals and platinum nanoparticles then the glucose oxidase attaches to the platinum nanoparticles  the enzyme converts glucose to peroxide which generates a signal on the electrode typically when you want to make a nanostructured biosensor you have to use a lot of processing steps before you reach the final biosensor product kumar said   that involves lithography chemical processing etching and other steps the good thing about these petals is that they can be grown on just about any surface and we don t need to use any of these steps so it could be ideal for commercialization   in addition to diabetes testing the technology might be used for sensing a variety of chemical compounds to test for other medical conditions   because we used the enzyme glucose oxidase in this work it s geared for diabetes claussen said but we could just swap out that enzyme with for example glutemate oxidase to measure the neurotransmitter glutamate to test for parkinson s and alzheimer s or ethanol oxidase to monitor alcohol levels for a breathalyzer  it s very versatile fast and portable the technology is able to detect glucose in concentrations as low as 0 3 micromolar far more sensitive than other electrochemical biosensors based on graphene or graphite carbon nanotubes and metallic nanoparticles claussen said  these are the first findings to report such a low sensing limit and at the same time such a wide sensing range he said the sensor is able to distinguish between glucose and signals from other compounds that often cause interference in sensors uric acid ascorbic acid and acetaminophen which are commonly found in the blood  unlike glucose those compounds are said to be electroactive which means they generate an electrical signal without the presence of an enzyme  glucose by itself doesn t generate a signal but must first react with the enzyme glucose oxidase glucose oxidase is used in commercial diabetes test strips for conventional diabetes meters that measure glucose with a finger pinprick  the research has been funded by the u s office of naval research and the national science foundation note to journalists a

aS' signature of long sought particle that could revolutionize quantum computing seen by purdue physicist signature of long sought particle that could revolutionize quantum computing seen by purdue physicist west lafayette ind a purdue university physicist has observed evidence of long sought majorana fermions special particles that could unleash the potential of fault tolerant quantum computing  leonid rokhinson an associate professor of physics led a team that is the first to successfully demonstrate the fractional a c  josephson effect which is a signature of the particles the search for this particle is for condensed matter physicists what the higgs boson search was for high energy particle physicists rokhinson said   it is a very peculiar object because it is a fermion yet it is its own antiparticle with zero mass and zero charge the pursuit of majorana fermions is driven by their potential to encode quantum information in a way that solves a problem dogging quantum computing  the current carriers of quantum bits the basic unit of information in quantum computing are delicate and easily destroyed by small disturbances from the local environment  information stored through majorana fermions could be protected from such perturbances resulting in a much more resilient quantum bit and fault tolerant quantum computing he said   information could be stored not in the individual particles but in their relative configuration so that if one particle is pushed a little by a local force it doesn t matter rokhinson said   as long as that local noise is not so strong that it alters the overall configuration of a group of particles the information is retained  it offers an entirely new way of dealing with information majorana fermions also have the unique ability to retain a history of their interactions that can be used to encode quantum information he said   other particles are interchangeable and if two electrons trade places it is as if nothing had happened but when you swap two majorana fermions it leaves a mark by altering their quantum mechanical state rokhinson said   this change in state is like a passport book full of stamps and provides a record of exactly how the particle arrived at its current destination   rokhinson observed a variation of the josephson effect that is a unique signature of majorana fermions the effect describes the way an electrical current traveling between two superconductors oscillates at a frequency that depends on the applied voltage  the reverse also is true an oscillating current generates specific voltage proportional to the frequency in the presence of majorana fermions the frequency voltage relationship should change by a factor of two in what is called the fractional a c  josephson effect he said rokhinson used a one dimensional semiconductor coupled to a superconductor to create a hybrid nanowire in which majorana particles are predicted to form at the ends  when alternating current is applied through a set of two such wires a specific voltage is generated across the device which rokhinson measured  as a magnetic field was applied and varied from weak to strong the resulting steps in voltage became twice as tall a signature of the formation of majorana particles he said  victor yakovenko a professor of physics at the university of maryland was one of the first theorists to predict the fractional a c  josephson effect the effect is very unusual and is specific to majorana particles which makes this observation more definitive than signatures obtained through other approaches he said   majorana particles are the only particle that can produce this effect and experimental observation of it is a tremendous breakthrough yakovenko said   of course it will take time and independent confirmation to firmly establish it but this is very exciting the observation of this special state does not mean fault tolerant quantum computing will happen any time soon if at all yakovenko said   whether or not these particles will work for quantum computing has yet to be seen but in the process of trying we will learn a lot of unknown quantum physics he said   this could open the door to a whole new field of the topological effects of quantum mechanics a paper detailing the work will be published in the next issue of the journal nature physics and is currently available online co authors include xinyu liu and jacek furdyna of the university of notre dame who designed the material specifically for these experiments  furdyna also has an honorary degree from purdue the work was partially supported by grants from the army research office and the national science foundation  rokhinson next plans to perform follow up experiments and to modify the system to probe different properties of the observed state  the fractional ac josephson effect in a semiconductor superconductor nanowire as a signature of majorana particles topological superconductors that support majorana fermions have been predicted when one dimensional semiconducting wires are coupled to a superconductor  such excitations are expected to exhibit non abelian statistics and can be used to realize quantum gates that are topologically protected from local sources of decoherence  here we report the observation of the fractional a c josephson effect in a hybrid semiconductor superconductor insb nb nanowire junction a hallmark of topological matter  when the junction is irradiated with a radio frequency f0 in the absence of an external magnetic field quantized voltage steps shapiro steps with a height 8710 v hf 0 2e are observed as is expected for conventional superconductor junctions where the supercurrent is carried by charge 2e cooper pairs  at high magnetic fields the height of the first shapiro step is doubled to hf0 e suggesting that the supercurrent is carried by charge e quasiparticles  this is a unique signature of the majorana fermions predicted almost 80 years ago '

aS' specialists sell grain at harvest this fall store only if necessary west lafayette ind economic trends and concerns over the condition of grain because of the drought suggest there s little incentive for farmers to store grain this fall  but those who do will need to quickly dry it down to a proper moisture content and watch for contamination purdue university specialists say  as farmers prepare to harvest a poorer than expected corn and soybean crop they have to consider whether to hold onto their grain and hope for higher prices or sell it right out of the field  in most cases farmers should skip storage and take their grain directly to the elevator said corinne alexander agricultural economist   from an economics perspective in short crop years one of the things we tend to see is that prices peak early either before or during harvest and then decline through the remainder of the marketing year alexander said   the market is giving a strong signal to farmers to deliver early and at harvest because storage will not be profitable this is true for both corn and soybeans   markets reacted strongly to a pair of aug 10 u s department of agriculture reports one report estimated a 2012 national corn crop of just 10 8 billion bushels and a soybean crop of only 2 69 billion bushels down 13 percent and 12 percent respectively from 2011  another report projected lower world grain supplies for the 2012 marketing year that news along with a continued decline in crop condition as a summer long drought dragged on sent prices for corn and soybeans soaring  in recent weeks corn has eclipsed 8 a bushel while soybeans have shot past 16 a bushel farmers considering waiting out the market for even higher prices could be leaving money on the table if they put their grain in a bin alexander said  prices are likely to come down in the first quarter of 2013 as south american farmers harvest their corn and soybeans and provide some relief for stressed world stocks   those would include livestock producers who are supplying their own feed or producers who have contracts with either food or ethanol processors where the contract specifies a later delivery date she said  storing grain could present a host of challenges this fall including drydown methods mold leftover fine material in bins and insects said richard stroshine a grain quality specialist  grain could be going into bins at higher moisture levels and temperatures because many farmers planted early and could be harvesting later this month or in september when temperatures are hotter than in the typical harvest months of october and november stroshine said  unless farmers work fast to get grain dried down to appropriate levels their crop could spoil in the bin if grain is placed in a bin dry it needs to be cooled using aeration taking advantage of cooler nighttime temperatures stroshine said   mold will grow at 15 percent moisture if the corn is fairly warm say 80 degrees or so stroshine said it s very slow but there still can be mold growth there that could eventually compromise your ability to store the corn   for early harvested corn stroshine recommends a stored moisture content of 14 5 percent or 13 percent if the grain will be stored through next summer  to get corn down to those lower moisture levels rapidly farmers should use high temperature cross flow drying farmers who need to dry in the bin can increase the drying rate using a technique called layer drying stroshine said  like the name implies a farmer will place grain in the bin in layers while continuously drying that first layer will dry faster than normal and by the time you put your second layer in the bin you will have gotten some field drydown of that grain which should save some in bin drying time he said   another thing to remember is if you don t remove the fine material from the bin before you put grain into it you ll need to core your bin  fine material tends to concentrate in the center of the bin to core the bin open the center well pull out a load and you should get a lot of those fines out  if your grain is peaked you also should level the top surface which is very important for good aeration crop insurance crop losses incurred in the field are covered by insurance but post harvest crop losses are not   grain breakage dry kernels and kernels that have been invaded by fungi in the field will break up more easily so you ll need to set your combine at the lowest cylinder speed you can to get a decent removal of kernels from the cobs stroshine said   you ll also probably have a lot of foreign material with those kernels pieces of stalk and cob that could cause some problems  you might need some kind of cleaning equipment to help you out because i don t think the combine will be able to do it alone aspergillus ear rot  the hot and dry summer has provided a good environment for the development of this fungus in corn the fungus produces aflatoxin a carcinogen that can be harmful or fatal to livestock fed the infected corn  grain testing can identify infected kernels removing fine material and small kernels from the harvested grain can reduce the levels of mycotoxins but not eliminate them altogether   insects higher populations of grain damaging bugs are expected this year with the warmer temperatures and the availability of broken kernels and fine material as food  insect problems have been reported in grain already in storage additional grain storage tips are available on the purdue post harvest grain quality website at http www grainquality org general

teams have taken part in krannert school of management s experiential learning institute eli they have advised companies that are local from throughout the united states and from overseas that needed outside help with various projects   eli began in the fall of 2009 as a way to offer krannert mba students the opportunity to apply what they had learned in the classroom in an active business setting said matthew lynall a clinical associate professor of management and eli director   we are moving to make eli accessible to krannert undergraduates and to students from throughout the university he said as the program has developed we have undertaken projects in conjunction with other purdue colleges and schools including engineering agriculture pharmacy communication and aviation technology   we also do projects in europe where the students spend half the semester at gisma business school our partner school in germany and the other half in west lafayette   client companies get the benefit of bright and enthusiastic students solving critical business problems the companies also are helping develop a new generation of business leaders while identifying potential employees  participating companies pay expenses incurred by the school and the teams each team has four to five students they get four credit hours for the full semester course and spend 10 15 hours a week on the project   the companies typically have some affiliation with purdue perhaps through alumni connections or recruiting on campus lynall said   we have a growing number of repeat clients also graduates who have done an eli project often are keen to help develop projects at their new employers  and then some companies hear about the program and approach us out of the blue among past clients have been

plant orchard of golf west lafayette and kyk energy a company formed by two purdue undergraduates   beyond the credit hours eli students get valuable experience great references and can sometimes end up with a job offer from their client organization lynall said  ben crockett is a case in point in the fall of 2010 crockett a krannert mba student began working with four other students on a project for dow agrosciences at its world headquarters in indianapolis  the team which included a student from colombia and a student from china looked at how the company s forage sales representatives were approaching clients who are mostly dairy farmers   you apply what you ve learned and put into practice theories from your classes it s real business real problems he said crockett s team finished up last spring at the same time he completed his mba  he has been working for dow agrosciences since then in productivity and strategy acceleration utilizing six sigma methodology and recently was promoted into a global supply chain role  crockett is from idaho and earned his bachelor s degree at brigham young university in utah he chose purdue for his mba because of its strong reputation in strategy and supply chain management  he had not planned on staying in indiana until the eli project led to the dow agrosciences job offer now he and his family are happy to be settled in indianapolis  brian fife global strategy implementation leader for dow agrosciences is a purdue graduate who initiated the company s relationship with eli  he said the work has had three benefits for dow agrosciences the company benefits from good quality projects and opportunities to evaluate potential talent while strengthening its relationship with purdue   we have a positive and strong collaboration with dr lynall he said that has helped us for instance in expanding the project team into the college of agriculture  the whole partnership is a win win situation we get access to knowledge and the students get real world work experience get to know our business and have the opportunity to show us what they can do   after starting his job crockett was assigned to be the dow agrosciences liaison with the next krannert team working on a project  a member of that team anthony fisher has just been hired and fife said fisher will be the liaison for dow agrosciences next eli project which will be submitted in the fall  the success of the eli projects with dow agrosciences is just the outcome lynall wants for the program we want to help students turn their expertise into

aS' students prefer apps to the web when using smartphones west lafayette ind students prefer using apps on their smartphones instead of being pointed to mobile app sites according to a survey of purdue university students  this runs counter to a move toward mobile web development using html 5 by many web developers the study results are being published tuesday sept  25 at the online academic site educause center for applied research the study had 1 566 respondents and a margin of error of 3 3 percent  at issue is whether when looking for information such as wanting to check the weather forecast students go to a weather app or simply use their phone s browser to connect with a weather website  the survey results were clear students want the app for almost every type of use surveyed students prefer to use an app they have installed on their phones the lone exception was for reference information  using the weather example students had a preference for the app by 85 percent versus 8 percent who wanted to use the web the purdue students said native apps are faster and simpler to navigate perceptions that are also true says kyle bowen director of information technology at purdue s informatics group and one of the paper s co authors   they are easier and faster to use but native app programming is new and unfamiliar to most web developers bowen says and trying to cut corners in developing an app such as by using a template tool doesn t help you in the long run   this isn t welcome news for web developers who are part of a national trend toward favoring html 5 built mobile websites over apps  for example a 2011 article in the chronicle of higher education was headlined as mobile devices multiply some colleges turn away from building campus apps  but it s not just universities that are learning this lesson at the techcrunch disrupt conference in september mark zuckerberg said facebook s biggest mistake so far was betting on the html 5 mobile web instead of focusing on native apps purdue has developed seven mobile classroom apps designed to raise student performance through its purdue studio project bowen who leads the project says although he would prefer to develop mobile websites the project team learned early on that students weren t comfortable with them   the first version of our hotseat app had a mobile web interface there was no native app bowen says we discovered that students would go the app store and look for the hotseat app and when it wasn t there they wouldn t use the software on their phone   matthew pistilli a co author on the paper and an academic technologies research scientist at purdue says this information into use preferences is important because there is little doubt that mobile devices are the future for higher education   the advantage of using mobile devices in higher education is that it allows the student to take the classroom almost anywhere pistilli says   for example using an app such as purdue s jetpack or through mobile access to blackboard students can read articles work on assignments or collaborate with others from anywhere   pistilli says there are hidden benefits too because instructors and administrators can learn more about which educational approaches are working through data produced by the apps   analytics collected on application use allow an instructor or institution to do several things such as fine tune the software promote the use of other apps or simply provide information to students about how they can enhance their class performance pistilli says   when asked how to rank their skill level on using the phone from novice only using the phone for calls email and texting to expert having developed mobile apps 85 percent considered themselves either an intermediate 42 percent or advanced 43 percent user   students rely on their devices users describing themselves as novice used their device an average of 2 1 hours per day and expert users are on their device 5 3 hours per day   the most popular operating systems were android used by 43 percent of the students and apple s ios which was used by 40 percent   there are a number of manufacturers building many different android smartphones so apple s iphone is the clear favorite device among our students bowen says   the least popular device was the rim blackberry which was used by 9 percent of the respondents students are aware of data charges and 33 percent say they would never download a video unless connected to a wi fi network  in the debate over native versus neutral what do students prefer is a student s preference for a mobile learning application related to the nature of the information provided or the activity performed  this research bulletin examines a study conducted by purdue university regarding student mobile preferences this study provides insights into how students prefer to consume information on the mobile devices ranging broad categories to coursework specific areas of interest  additionally a brief case study of purdue s own mobile development activities illustrates one example for how this information can be practically applied  the information detailed in this research bulletin is intended to help inform future mobile application development efforts as well as establish expectations for companies with which institutions do business   '

universities were chosen by nasa to create an original experiment in capillary fluid dynamics through the space agency s national lab education projects for the international space station   this project will give students unique and in depth real world team based original design build test educational experiences that will accelerate their learning and their careers said steven collicott the purdue professor of aeronautics and astronautics whose students will complete the project while taking his course on zero gravity flight experiments  he is leading the project with john kizito a professor of mechanical engineering at n c a t the collaboration will expose our students the next generation of explorers to microgravity science and technology kizito said  the experiment is part of overall work to provide data that could help in the design of systems that require the precise control of fluids and gases such as life support equipment and fuel tanks for spacecraft  students will study the physics of how fluids change shape inside tubes in weightlessness findings also could apply to technologies for use on earth such as fuel cells medical instruments and miniature diagnostic devices  primarily undergraduate engineering students at both universities will design and build the shoebox size experiment develop the procedures for operation in space train the astronauts process the data and write research papers describing the results   we anticipate the experiment becoming operational in orbit in 2014 or 2015 said collicott who has designed previous experiments operated on the space station and also using suborbital rockets and drop towers   collaborating with dr kizito to lead our students in the development of an orbital experiment is an exciting step for me his nasa experiences and his teaching and research make this a good pairing   the project includes efforts to inspire middle school students to pursue and enjoy topics in science technology engineering and math or stem fields   we envision curriculum development that teaches basic stem concepts based on the topic of the experiment collicott said a great thing about the experiment topic is that we can design desktop demonstrations that middle school teachers and students everywhere can replicate and learn from in a hands on manner   the effort also will include contributions from portland state university other team members are professors mark weislogel of portland state and todd kelley from purdue and consultant emily cobabe ammann  about 20 purdue undergraduate students will be involved in the project each semester over approximately three years 10 n c a t  students per semester will be directly involved and about 20 fluid mechanics students per semester will do coursework related to

aS' study children abused by parents face increased cancer risk new purdue research shows that frequent child abuse by a parent can increase a child s cancer risk in adulthood and the effects are especially significant when mothers abuse their daughters and fathers abuse their sons  the research was conducted by kenneth ferraro distinguished professor of sociology and director of purdue s center on aging and the life course and sociology and gerontology graduate student patricia morton  their work was funded by the national institute on aging and is published online by the journal of aging and health purdue university photo mark simons  west lafayette ind frequent abuse by a parent can increase a child s cancer risk in adulthood and the effects are especially significant when mothers abuse their daughters and fathers abuse their sons according to new research from purdue university   people often say that children are resilient and they ll bounce back but we found that there are events that can have long term consequences on adult health said kenneth ferraro distinguished professor of sociology and director of purdue s center on aging and the life course in this case people who were frequently emotionally or physically abused by their parents were more likely to have cancer in adulthood and the link was greater when fathers abused sons and mothers abused daughters  overall the more frequent and intense the abuse the more it elevated the cancer risk we would like to see child abuse noted as an environmental factor that can increase cancer occurrence in adulthood  more research on this topic also could help mediate the effects or improve interventions to help abused children the research which was conducted with sociology and gerontology graduate student patricia morton was funded by the national institute on aging and is published online by the journal of aging and health we started examining a variety of childhood misfortunes including abuse and when these were all combined we found that men with the most stressors during childhood were more likely to develop cancer morton said   second we found that when children were abused by their same sex parent it increased their cancer risk the researchers can t say exactly why that is but a possible reason is the effect of the greater social bond between same sex children and parents   other studies have shown that if a mother smokes the daughter is more likely to smoke and the same relationship is found when sons mirror their father s behavior morton said   more research is needed but another possibility is that men may be more likely to physically abuse their sons and mothers are more likely to physically abuse their daughters   the study s findings were based on survey data from 2 101 adults in two waves of the national survey of midlife development in the united states  abuse was one of many childhood misfortunes including poverty loss of parent and family educational status that researchers examined to determine if there was a link to cancer in adulthood  in the first analysis the research team found that men who experienced the most cumulative stressors during childhood were more likely to have cancer  this was not true with women and this suggests that men and women may have different responses to childhood stressors morton said  the second analysis looked at each category of misfortune and this is where the connection between abuse and cancer was revealed  survey participants were not directly asked if they were abused but abuse was defined by survey answers to questions such as how frequently a parent sibling or other person insulted or swore at them as a child refused to talk them threatened to hit them pushed grabbed or shoved threw something at them kicked bit or hit them with a fist choked them or burned or scalded them  the frequency of these abuses also was identified the link was still there when controlled for the adults age lifestyle choices and economic status but the researchers would like to look closer at these mechanisms   it also is likely ferraro said that the effect between child abuse and cancer is underrepresented in our study because people who suffered abuse and were then incarcerated placed in a mental institution or died were not included in this survey of adults  these groups may represent people with more acute and severe effects from abuse and even though they are omitted we still find a link   the researchers are now examining potential links between child abuse and other health outcomes including heart attacks and types of cancer   the connection between negative childhood events and mental health is accepted and these findings reinforce that such events can also have a long lasting effect on a person s physical health morton said   it s shocking just how much the damage sticks and it is a reminder that childhood which is defined by rapidly changing biological systems is a sensitive period of development   in addition to morton and ferraro markus schafer an assistant professor of sociology at the university of toronto and former purdue graduate student also participated on the research team  the national survey of midlife development in the united states is sponsored by the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation network on successful midlife development  note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service at 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu objective to address the inconsistent findings on whether childhood misfortune increases adult cancer occurrence  methods this study uses longitudinal data from the national survey of midlife development in the united states midus that first sampled 3 032 respondents aged 25 to 74 during 1995 1996  a series of logistic regressions were estimated separately for men and women to test whether the effect of childhood misfortune on adult cancer was largely cumulative or specific to the type or profile of misfortune  results for men additive childhood misfortune physical abuse by father and frequent abuse by either parent increased cancer risk  for women physical abuse by mother and frequent abuse by either parent increased cancer risk discussion analyses reveal the importance of examining alternative specifications of childhood misfortune for men and women  additive childhood misfortune predicted cancer for men only whereas child abuse by parent of the same sex predicted cancer for men and women

neuroscience purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind the world continues to be a noisy place and purdue university researchers have found that all that background chatter causes the ears of those with hearing impairments to work differently   when immersed in the noise the neurons of the inner ear must work harder because they are spread too thin said kenneth s henry a postdoctoral researcher in purdue s department of speech language and hearing sciences   it s comparable to turning on a dozen television screens and asking someone to focus on one program the result can be fuzzy because these neurons get distracted by other information   the findings by henry and michael g heinz an associate professor of speech language and hearing sciences are published as a brief communication in nature neuroscience the work was funded by the national institutes of health and the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders   previous studies on how the inner ear processes sound have failed to find connections between hearing impairment and degraded temporal coding in auditory nerve fibers which transmit messages from the inner ear to the brain said heinz who studies auditory neuroscience   the difference is that such earlier studies were done in quiet environments but when the same tests are conducted in a noisy environment there is a physical difference in how auditory nerve fibers respond to sound   hearing loss suffered in varying degrees by 36 million american adults means there is damage to sensory cells in the cochlea and to cochlear neurons as well  the cochlea is the part of the inner ear that transforms sound into electrical messages to the brain in this study the researchers measured a variety of physiological markers in chinchillas some with normal hearing and others with a cochlear hearing loss as they listened to tones in quiet and noisy environments  chinchillas are used because they have a similar hearing range to humans and background noise is used in the study to simulate what people would hear in a crowded room   the study confirmed that there is essentially no change even for those with hearing loss in terms of how the cochlear neurons are processing the tones in quiet but once noise was added we did observe a diminished coding of the temporal structure henry said  the researchers focused on coding of the temporal fine structure of sound which involves synchrony of neural discharges to relatively fast fluctuations in sound pressure  both coding of fast fine structure information and coding of slower envelope fluctuations are critical to perception of speech in everyday listening environments   when noise was part of the study there was a reduction in how synchronized the neurons were with the temporal fine structure henry said  the auditory system filters sound into a number of channels that are tuned to different frequencies and those channels vary based on their frequency tuning  in a normal system the channels are sharp and focused but they get broader and more scattered with hearing impairment now that we know a major physiological effect from hearing loss is that the auditory nerve fibers are particularly distracted by background noise this has implications for research and clinical settings said heinz who also has a joint appointment in biomedical engineering   for example most audiology testing whether it is lab research or hearing loss screenings takes place in a quiet environment but testing noisy more realistic backgrounds is necessary to truly understand how the ear is processing sound  this also could influence the design of hearing aids and assistive technologies designers are often working on improving the temporal coding of the signal but this research suggests that a primary focus should be on improving noise reduction algorithms so the hearing aid provides a clean signal to the auditory nerve  other ways people can reduce background noise include induction loop hearing systems which are used in churches and other public settings to provide a cleaner signal by avoiding room noise   next the researchers plan to expand the study to focus on more real world noises and coding of slower envelope information in sound   additional study is certainly needed and there are others who are also looking at the role the central nervous system plays too henry said   but ultimately we found that hearing loss degrades temporal coding of sounds in background noise in the cochlea the most peripheral level of auditory processing

humans suggest that sensorineural hearing loss snhl decreases sensitivity to the temporal structure of sound but neurophysiological studies in mammals provide little evidence for diminished temporal coding  we found that snhl in chinchillas degraded peripheral temporal coding in background noise substantially more than in quiet these results resolve discrepancies between previous studies and help to explain why perceptual difficulties in hearing impaired listeners often emerge in noisy situations   '

aS' study moms can be stressed when certain children care for them research by megan gilligan from left a purdue doctoral student and jill suitor a professor of sociology found that older mothers are more likely to be stressed when they receive help from an adult child who is not their preferred caretaker   purdue university photo andrew hancock download photo west lafayette ind older mothers are more likely to be stressed when they receive help from an adult child who is not their preferred caretaker according to new research from purdue university   most mothers have a preference for which child they turn to in a crisis confide in and prefer as their future caregivers said jill suitor a professor of sociology   and when mothers received care from the adult child who was not their first choice they reported more depressive symptoms such as sadness loneliness and sleep disturbances  although mothers appreciated and acknowledged efforts from caregivers who were not their first choices these children were less likely to share the mothers values and to have the personal characteristics important to the mothers in selecting preferred caregivers  this incompatibility can have some strong negative effects on the flip side receiving care from a mother s preferred child did not affect the mom s psychological well being she said   we expected having that preferred child care for a parent would make a positive difference but surprisingly it didn t suitor said   and we also found that mothers depressive symptoms were higher when they received care from the non preferred child than when they received no care from their offspring   suitor also a faculty member in purdue s center on aging and the life course who studies parental favoritism with adult children collaborated on this research with megan gilligan a purdue doctoral student and karl pillemer professor and director of the cornell institute for translational research on aging at cornell university  the research was funded by the national institute on aging and is online in the gerontologist the findings were based on in person interviews with 234 older mothers as part of a larger study of 566 multigenerational families that began in 2001 when the mothers were 65 75 and had at least two adult children still living  all of the mothers were interviewed again seven years later the new research is based on the 234 women who reported they needed care within the previous two years because of serious injury or illness  during the initial interviews 75 percent of the mothers named a particular child they would prefer provide care if they became ill or disabled  this was compared to the children s actual roles seven years later after the mothers needed help the reasons why preferred children sometimes could not care for their moms were because they moved away or had medical problems themselves  researchers also controlled for family size and no differences were found based on number of children the researchers found that being cared for by a non preferred child is stressful because the alternate caregivers did not possess the social and emotional characteristics that the mothers expected   this matters because it makes people comfortable and this is especially important when people are under a lot of stress and in situations where they relinquish control to another person suitor said   and who do you want to give up control to to someone who has the same outlook on life and who you think is very much like you and therefore can respond to your needs and be a source of reassuring support   for example one of the moms in the study said that her preferred caregiver who lives far away was her preference because they can talk about anything  i think she understands me best and while the mom acknowledged the daughter caring for her was helpful and reliable she couldn t talk with her as openly  she would get annoyed with me although she s my rock here because she s the one that s here these findings are similar to previous work by suitor and pillemer that shows these factors are critical in relationships for spouses and adult siblings   as people become older and their health declines they start placing greater emphasis on relationships with family and friends with whom they have a personal history or an especially close and comfortable relationship and reducing contact with people with whom they are less comfortable gilligan said  when asked about the implications of these findings suitor said making assumptions about which children mothers want as their caregivers may be problematic  her previous studies on adult children and mothers show that the children accurately predict whether their mothers favor some children over others about 80 percent of the time but they are correct only about half the time in identifying which child the mom favors regarding closeness confiding in or for future care   we are not clinicians but i think there are lessons that can be learned from this research that can be put to use in conversations that families have about advanced care planning suitor said   perhaps these conversations can be expanded to include which children mom would prefer provide her with care geography often plays a role in preventing the preferred child from providing care but perhaps the adult children stepping into the role can call their brother or sister and say i m thinking about doing this for mom what do you think   ideally they can coordinate and avoid conflict the survey data is part of a 13 year project the within family difference study led by suitor and pillemer to evaluate the role favoritism plays in adult and family relationships  the data for the project was collected in the boston metropolitan area by the center for survey research at the university of massachusetts boston  in the project s next phase they plan to expand the study of causes and consequences of favoritism to three generations of the families they have been following  they also plan to extend the project by collecting data from several hundred multigenerational hispanic families in the chicago metropolitan area  note to journalists journalists interested in a copy of the article can contact amy patterson neubert purdue news service at 765 494 9723  apatterson purdue edu abstract the role of violated caregiver preferences in psychological well being when older mothers need assistance purpose of the study theory and research suggest that congruence between individuals preferences for future care and the patterns of care received will affect well being  in this paper we explore whether older mothers psychological well being was affected by whether the children they preferred as future caregivers provided assistance at a later point when the mothers experienced illness or injury  design and methods in this article we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collected from 234 older mothers and two points seven years apart beginning when the mothers were 65 75  results multivariate analyses demonstrated that mothers who received assistance from children whom they did not identify as preferred future caregivers reported higher depressive symptoms at t2 receiving care from children identified as preferred caregivers did not affect well being  qualitative data suggested these patterns occurred because the alternate caregivers did not possess the socioemotional attributes of preferred children  implications these findings contribute to a growing body of research demonstrating the consequences of violated preferences particularly when individuals are in need of support in later life   '

aS' superconductor flaws could be key to its abilities purdue physicist erica carlson stands in front of an illustration of the fractal clusters present in copper oxygen based superconducting material   purdue university photo mark simons download photo west lafayette ind many researchers studying superconductivity strive to create a clean pure perfect sample but a team of physicists found that some flaws might hold the key to a material s unique abilities  erica carlson a purdue university associate professor of physics led a team that mapped seemingly random four atom wide dark lines of electrons seen on the surface of copper oxygen based superconducting crystals  the team uncovered a pattern in these flawed lines which are separate from the expected structure of the material and discovered that they exist throughout the crystal  the findings suggest the lines could play a role in the material s superconductivity at much higher temperatures than others this material is ceramic like your dinner plates and it has no business conducting electricity but under the right conditions it conducts electricity perfectly with zero energy loss carlson said   a better understanding of how and why this superconductor works could help us design better ones if we can create a superconductor that works at high enough temperatures it could transform how we use and generate energy   for instance room temperature superconductive wires could lead to power lines that do not leak electricity in transit saving tremendous amounts of energy and money  superconductors also have special magnetic properties that could allow for levitated frictionless trains and stronger more durable permanent magnets like those used in wind turbines she said  the electrons confined to these mysterious lines behave radically different than those that freely move throughout the crystal and it had been suggested that they could play a role in superconductivity  however whether the lines were merely surface effects or extended into the material was unknown because the scanning tunneling microscopy that reveals them can only be used on the material s surface she said  carlson collaborated with karin dahmen from the university of illinois and purdue graduate student benjamin phillabaum on a study to examine the tiny ladderlike lines that point vertically or horizontally across the surface of the crystal  by treating sets of neighboring parallel lines as part of a single cluster the team discovered that the patterns formed by the clusters are fractal in nature meaning they fall between two dimensions of space carlson said   when thinking of a fractal imagine a crumpled piece of paper she said it is more than the two dimensional flat piece of paper and it enters three dimensions but it does not quite fill that space  it is not a true and solid ball fractals can occupy fractions of a dimension they also have a pattern that is maintained even as you view smaller and smaller pieces of it   fractal patterns are mathematically understood and the patterns present on the surface of the copper oxygen based high temperature superconductors could be compared to known models of how that pattern can arise  using this information the team was able to determine that these patterns originate from deep inside the material a paper detailing the nsf and research corporation for science advancement funded research was published in nature communications the fractal patterns also offer information about the space they occupy and through this work the team developed a new analysis method to help understand the materials and the interactions going on inside of them carlson said   if you see pattern formation then you can try to identify the fundamental physics causing its formation she said it can apply to a lot of systems and materials beyond superconductors   carlson said the method could be used to identify the dominant class of disorder present in a material which helps in understanding its unique characteristics   we want to move beyond trying to get rid of disorder striving for unattainable purity in the materials we examine and instead take the disorder into account and use it to our advantage carlson said   these little patches of imperfection where things aren t lined up in a perfect crystal lattice are important and old methods that overlooked them fail to capture important physics  the flaws in the lines are like a fingerprint they reveal the identity deeper inside abstract surface probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy have detected complex electronic patterns at the nanoscale in many high temperature superconductors  in cuprates the pattern formation is associated with the pseudogap phase a precursor to the high temperature superconducting state  rotational symmetry breaking of the host crystal in the form of electronic nematicity has recently been proposed as a unifying theme of the pseudogap phase  however the fundamental physics governing the nanoscale pattern formation has not yet been identified here we introduce a new set of methods for analyzing strongly correlated electronic systems including the effects of both disorder and broken symmetry  we use universal cluster properties extracted from scanning tunneling microscopy studies of cuprate superconductors to identify the fundamental physics controlling the complex pattern formation  because of a delicate balance between disorder interactions and material anisotropy we find that the electron nematic is fractal in nature and that it extends throughout the bulk of the material   '

aS' survey indiana farmland values cash rents soar west lafayette ind indiana s farmland values and cash rents have continued to soar in 2012 even amid the worst drought in decades according to a june 2012 purdue university survey  the purdue farmland value survey showed a statewide increase in farmland value ranging from 14 3 percent to 18 1 percent depending on land quality since the 2011 survey  cash rents increased between 12 8 percent and 15 2 percent robust net farm incomes favorable interest rates strong farmland demand and a limited supply of farmland for sale kept indiana farmland values and cash rents moving higher said craig dobbins purdue extension agricultural economist  statewide the average value of bare indiana cropland ranged from 5 013 per acre for poor quality land to 7 704 per acre for top quality land  to assess farmland productivity survey respondents estimated long term corn yields for poor average and top quality land for the state the average long term corn yields for poor average and top were 126 159 and 192 bushels per acre respectively  the farmland value increases are good news for landowners but not necessarily for some prospective buyers dobbins said for the landowners the increase is generally a good thing he said   it makes the asset that much more valuable and if they are thinking about selling it they can sell it for a good price if you re someone who is trying to start out or get into farming this news isn t all that good  it just makes it more difficult to make a farmland purchase according to dobbins 2012 was the year many thought crop production margins and thus farmland values would level out or even fall  but the season long drought hiked grain prices and the prospects of higher 2013 and maybe 2014 grain prices led to higher farmland values  values of farmland moving out of agriculture called transitional land also are on the rise after a four year decline the 2012 average value was 8 505 up 7 2 percent from 2011   this is a specialized market with the transitional land value strongly influenced by the planned use and location dobbins said   the estimated value of farmland in this market has a very wide range for example transitional land value estimates in the june survey ranged from 2 500 per acre to 21 000  because of those variations dobbins said the median transitional land value of 8 000 per acre is likely more meaningful than the average  that number represents an increase in value of 750 per acre the survey also looked at the value of rural recreational land which includes land used for hunting and other recreational activities  the average value of an acre of recreational land was 3 489 an increase of 3 9 percent from 2011 the median value in june 2012 was 3 000 per acre the same as last year   as with transitional land there is a wide range of values for rural recreational land again making the median value a more meaningful indicator than arithmetic average dobbins said  this year s survey includes responses from 276 farm managers appraisers land brokers agricultural loan officers purdue extension educators farmers and professionals representing the farm credit system the farm service agency county offices and insurance companies  respondents represented six indiana regions and all but four indiana counties a full assessment of the survey results and more information about respondents and data gathering methods are available in the august 2012 edition of the purdue agricultural economics report at http www agecon purdue edu extension pubs paer pdf paer8_2012 pdf'

aS' test video photo abstract members of the jefferson high school football team seen here during practice were monitored in research to learn how impacts to the head affect brain function   purdue university file photo andrew hancock west lafayette ind a two year study of high schoolfootball players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits overtime and not from a single blow to the head as commonly believed  purdue university researchers have studied footballplayers for two seasons at jefferson high school in lafayette ind where 21players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season including 16 repeating players  helmet sensor impact data from each player were comparedwith brain imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before during and aftereach season   the most important implication of the new findingsis the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow but it s really the totality of blows that took place over the season said eric nauman an associate professor of mechanical engineering and anexpert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma the one hitthat brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel sback   researchers evaluated players using a type of brainimaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging or fmri alongwith a computer based neurocognitive screening test  the fmri scans revealwhich parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks thomas talavage an expert in functional neuroimaging andco director of the purdue mri facility said the scans indicate players areadapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes  brain scans show differences among high school football players in a two year study that suggests concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head as commonly believed   purdue university image thomas talavage the changes in brain activity we are observingsuggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced talavage said   the level of change in the fmri signal is significantly correlated to thenumber and distribution of hits that a player takes performance doesn tchange but brain activity changes showing that certain areas are no longerbeing recruited to perform a task   findings detailed in a paper to appear online in the journal of biomechanics are contrary toconventional thinking most clinicians would say that if you don t have anyconcussion symptoms you have no problems said larry leverenz an expertin athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology however we are finding that there is actually a lot of change even whenyou don t have symptoms   the paper was written by mechanical engineering graduatestudent evan breedlove nauman leverenz talavage former purdue professor ofeducational studies jeffrey gilger biomedical engineering graduate studentmeghan robinson health and kinesiology graduate student katherine e  morigaki electrical and computer engineering graduate student umit yoruk mechanicalengineering undergraduate student kyle o keefe and undergraduate student inelectrical and computer engineering jeffrey king  gilger is now a researcher atthe university of california merced the research may help to determine how many blows it takesto cause impairment which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting thenumber of hits a player receives per week   any change in fmri data is a concern but we don tyet know what these changes mean what they translate to in terms of cognitiveimpairment breedlove said  a common assumption in sports medicine is that certainpeople are innately more susceptible to head injury however the new findingssuggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the mostimportant factor talavage said   over the two seasons we had six concussed players but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not haveconcussions talavage said   there is good correlation with thenumber of hits players received but we need more subjects the researchers have expanded the study to include anadditional high school football team and girls soccer   we want to increase the number of football playersin the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don t wear headprotection nauman said   we also want to include girls to seewhether they are affected differently than boys the research findings represent a dilemma because theysuggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose   this might be especially important in young peoplebecause the brain is still developing so even though subtle unexpressed damagedoesn t manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life gilger said  changes were seen in regions of the brain that have beenassociated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte a progressivedegenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and otherforms of head injury   this is still circumstantial evidence but itsuggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as aresult of all these hits and the regions most affected are the ones thatexhibit cte nauman said  players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1 900hits to the head in a single season with two players exceeding 1 800 hits helmet sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 gs tomore than 100 gs  findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive andaccurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions moreaccurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from headimpacts determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a singleimpact or repeated impacts and develop new interventions to reduce the riskand effects of head impacts   now that we know there is definitely a buildup ofdamage before the concussion occurs ultimately there is hope that we can domore to prevent concussions nauman said  the work is ongoing and supported with grants from theindiana state department of health s spinal cord and brain injury researchfund general electric healthcare the indiana clinical and translationalsciences institute and through the national science foundation and nationaldefense science and engineering graduate fellowships  researchers also will follow the case studies of playerswho take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes inbrain structure using mri scans  the

were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan  in addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes  stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the biomechanical

molten rock in the plume condensed and solidified falling back to the surface as a thin layer  this sample was found in western australia and formed 2 63 billion years ago in the aftermath of a large

smalldroplets of molten and vaporized rock in the plume condensed and solidified falling back to earth as a thin layer the round or oblong particles werepreserved in layers of rock and now researchers have analyzed them to recordprecise information about asteroids impacting earth from 3 5 billion to 35million years ago   what we have done is provide the foundation forunderstanding how to interpret the layers in terms of the size and velocity ofthe asteroid that made them said jay melosh an expert in impactcratering and a distinguished professor of earth and atmospheric sciences physics and aerospace engineering at purdue university  findings which support a theory that the earth endured anespecially heavy period of asteroid bombardment early in its history aredetailed in a research paper appearing online in the journal nature on wednesday april 25  thepaper was written by purdue physics graduate student brandon johnson and melosh the findings based on geologic observations support a theoretical study in acompanion paper in nature byresearchers at the southwest research institute in boulder colo  the period of heavy asteroid bombardment from 4 2 to 3 5billion years ago is thought to have been influenced by changes in the earlysolar system that altered the trajectory of objects in an asteroid belt locatedbetween mars and jupiter sending them on a collision course with earth   that s the postulate and this is the first realsolid evidence that it actually happened melosh said some of theasteroids that we infer were about 40 kilometers in diameter much larger thanthe one that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago that was about12 15 kilometers  but when we looked at the number of impactors as a functionof size we got a curve that showed a lot more small objects than large ones apattern that matches exactly the distribution of sizes in the asteroid belt for the first time we have a direct connection between the crater sizedistribution on the ancient earth and the sizes of asteroids out inspace   because craters are difficult to study directly impacthistory must be inferred either by observations of asteroids that periodicallypass near the earth or by studying craters on the moon  now the new techniqueusing spherules offers a far more accurate alternative to chronicle asteroidimpacts on earth melosh said   we can look at these spherules see how thick thelayer is how big the spherules are and we can infer the size and velocity ofthe asteroid melosh said   we can go back to the earliest era inthe history of the earth and infer the population of asteroids impacting theplanet for asteroids larger than about 10 kilometers in diameter the spherules are deposited in a global layer   some of these impacts were several times larger thanthe chicxulub impact that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago johnson said   the impacts may have played a large role in the evolutionalhistory of life the large number of impacts may have helped simple life byintroducing organics and other important materials at a time when life on earthwas just taking hold   a 40 kilometer asteroid would have wiped out everything onthe earth s surface whereas the one that struck 65 million years ago killedonly land animals weighing more than around 20 kilograms   impactcraters are the most obvious indication of asteroid impacts but craters onearth are quickly obscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonicprocesses johnson said   however the spherule layers if preservedin the geologic record provide information about an impact even when thesource crater cannot be found   the purdue researchers studied the spherules usingcomputer models that harness mathematical equations developed originally tocalculate the condensation of vapor   there have been some new wrinkles in vaporcondensation modeling that motivated us to do this work and we were the firstto apply it to asteroid impacts melosh said  the researchers also are studying a different type ofartifact similar to spherules but found only near the original impact site whereas the globally distributed spherules come from the condensing vaporizedrock these melt droplets are from rock that s been melted and notcompletely vaporized   before this work it was not possible to distinguishbetween these two types of formations melosh said nobody hadestablished criteria for discriminating between them and we ve done thatnow   one of the authors of the southwest research institutepaper david minton is now an assistant professor of earth and atmosphericsciences at purdue  findings from the research may enable melosh s team toenhance an asteroid impact effects calculator he developed to estimate whatwould happen if asteroids of various sizes were to hit the earth  thecalculator impact earth allows anyone to calculate potentialcomet or asteroid damage based on the object s mass note to journalists  an electronic copy of the research
