\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 Defending champion University of Wisconsin-Stout won the 24th annual Rube Goldberg Machine Contest on Saturday (March 26) at Purdue University.\
\
Immediately after Saturday's competition, a machine built by a Purdue team completed a flawless run of 232 steps, surpassing the world record of 230 steps held by Ferris State University.\
\
Purdue's Society of Professional Engineers/Society of Hispanic Engineers team will submit a video of the run to Guinness World Records for certification. The machine follows the history of the world from the big bang to the present.\
\
Saturday's competition was only the second time Wisconsin-Stout has competed. Its machine told the story of a deserted Louisiana estate whose dead residents come to life with the full moon.\'a0\
\
The task for the Rube Goldberg machines this year was to water a plant.\
\
The Rube Goldberg competition, sponsored by Phi Chapter of Theta Tau fraternity, rewards machines that most effectively combine creativity with inefficiency and complexity.\
\
Machines must use at least 20 steps to complete the task in no more than two minutes. Teams have three tries to complete two runs. Points are deducted if students have to assist the machine once it has started.\
\
The Wisconsin-Stout machine had 135 steps. The team completed one perfect run with no interventions and one run with one intervention.\
\
\
Andrew Behnke, captain of the University of Wisconsin-Stout team, explains the workings of the team's winning Rube Goldberg machine.\

\
Captain Andrew Behnke of Loyal, Wis., said the team, composed mostly of education and business majors, developed a storyline that drove the steps for the handcrafted machine.\
\
Pennsylvania State University took second place with a Penn State-themed machine that included a football stadium and legendary coach Joe Paterno. The University of Texas was third. Its machine traced the cycle of water.\
\
Other teams competing were from St. Olaf College of Northfield, Minn.; Ferris State University of Big Rapids, Mich.; University of Illinois; Washington State Community College; Virginia Commonwealth University; Genesee Community College of Batavia, N.Y.; and Texas A&M University.\
\
On display during the contest was the machine from New Auburn, Wis., which won the national Rube Goldberg High School Competition on March 19 at Ferris State University. New Auburn has just 350 students in grades K-12 but has won the national high school contest three times. Its machine had a Toy Story theme.\
\
Jennifer George, Rube Goldberg's granddaughter and legacy director of Rube Goldberg Inc., attended Saturday's competition. "I'm thrilled to be here. It's incredibly exciting," she told the audience. "I know my grandfather is here in spirit."\
\
She announced that the task for next year's contest will be to blow up and then pop a balloon.\
\
It also was announced that Rube Goldberg Inc. will begin a virtual online machine contest for middle school students next school year.\
\
Details on that and other Rube Goldberg contests and activities can be found at http://www.rubegoldberg.com\
\
Sponsors for this year's competition were BAE Systems, Omega Engineering, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins, Alcoa, Priio and Ethicon Endo-Surgery.\
\
Rube Goldberg specialized in drawing whimsical machines with complex mechanisms to perform simple tasks. He earned a degree in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1904. He worked as an engineer for the city of San Francisco for less than a year before becoming a sports cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He received a Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for his political cartoons published by the New York Sun.\
\
The Rube Goldberg Machine Contest dates back to 1949 when it began as a competition between two Purdue fraternities. It was held until 1955, then revived in 1983 and opened to all Purdue students. The first national contest was held in 1988.\

Purdue in Princeton Review's top 150 'best value' colleges\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'97 Purdue University is listed among the Princeton Review's 150 "best value" colleges for 2012, released Tuesday (Feb. 7).\
\
The education services and test-prep company says the list, which appeared in USA Today, "is considered a guide for prospective college applicants to seek out the best value for their money."\
\
The listing is based on an analysis from surveys conducted from fall 2010 through fall 2011. The top 10 public and private "best values" are ranked; the rest are listed alphabetically.\
\
It is the second time this academic year that Purdue has been recognized for being a good value. In August, SmartMoney magazine ranked Purdue seventh nationally in its college "payback" survey, which quantified the long-term value of a college degree.\
\
"This survey is more evidence that Purdue is a tremendous value," said Timothy D. Sands, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. "Our students obtain an excellent education at a reasonable price. That's why we're attracting the best students."\
\
Schools on the best value list were selected based on surveys of administrators and students at more than 650 public and private colleges and universities. Selection criteria included more than 30 factors in academics, costs and financial aid.\
\
Robert Franek, Best Value Colleges lead author, told USA Today that value is about more than just "a low sticker price. The commitment has to be much deeper than that."\
\
Tuition at Purdue for the 2011-12 academic year is $9,478 for in-state students and $27,646 for out-of-state students. The average SAT score for current Purdue freshmen is 1,325 on the critical reading, math and writing sections.\
\
The Princeton Review summary says, in part, "When people think of Purdue University, what usually comes to mind is its outstanding engineering and agricultural programs, but students pursuing other degrees want you to know there are 'many other prestigious majors.' "\
\
"Regardless of your major, 'Purdue prepares students to be leaders by helping them grow personally and professionally during their collegiate years through a combination of strong academic programs, leadership opportunities and social activities.' 'It provides one-of-a-kind experiences in research, professors and organizations.' "\
\
Other universities in the state included in the "best value" survey are DePauw University, Hanover College, Indiana University and the University of Notre Dame. In addition to Purdue and Indiana, other Big Ten universities ranked include the University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and Ohio State University.\

Krannert MBA program improves in Financial Times rankings\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'97 Purdue University's Krannert School of Management MBA program has been ranked 12th among U.S. public colleges and universities by Financial Times.\
\
The program was ranked 17th among U.S. public schools last year.\
\
In the 2012 Financial Times ranking of full-time MBA programs globally, Krannert was 59th, up from 74th last year. Krannert ranked 29th among all U.S. programs, public and private, up from 39th last year.\
\
"Purdue University's Krannert School is embarking on a new journey to reaffirm its global stature and recognition as a premier program that produces 'Analytical Thinkers, Global Leaders' ", said Dean P. Christopher Earley. "We are gratified that this new momentum is reflected in the FT rankings, and we're very excited to be launching new learning opportunities for the global business educational arena.\
\
Purdue's leadership in engineering, science and technology is an ideal match for Krannert's emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship linking fundamental scientific discovery to cutting-edge business practices.\'94\'a0\
\
The Financial Times rankings are based on data collected from business schools and their alumni.\
\
Graduates are surveyed three years after completing their degrees to assess the impact of the MBA on their subsequent career progression and salary growth.\
\
The criteria used in the Financial Times rankings are grouped into three main areas: alumni salaries and career development, the diversity and international reach of the business school and its MBA program, and the research capabilities of each school.\
\
The Financial Times data shows that the average student who completes the Krannert MBA sees a 112 percent salary increase compared to compensation before earning their MBA. Three years after graduation, the average Krannert graduate earned $103,304.\
\
Krannert's MBA also ranked 46th for best value for the money, which compares salary to education and time costs in earning the degree.\
\
More information on the Financial Times' rankings can be found at http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/faacbfd2-4566-11e1-a719-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1kxDxCDCc\

\
INDIANAPOLIS - Purdue University is rolling out the first initiative of its decadal funding plan with the announcement on Wednesday (Jan. 11) that it will proceed with the first steps toward a balanced trimester. The trimester is an effort designed to enhance students' academic opportunities as well as help them move more quickly toward graduation.\
\
President France A. C\'f3rdova, during the announcement at the Lumina Foundation headquarters, said that the balanced trimester initiative is one of several to be unveiled over the next few months in the decadal planning process.\
\
Purdue's decadal funding plan is a long-term commitment to help offset declining state appropriations and reduce tuition increases.\
\
"We have spent a lot of time thinking through the various elements of the 10-year funding plan," she said. "Now that we better understand the costs and returns involved, it's time to put these initiatives in motion."\
\
Beginning this summer, the university will expand its summer program offerings as a first step toward implementing a full-summer trimester.\
\
"Purdue has moved boldly to become more productive, affordable and supportive of students more quickly completing their degrees," said Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. "This is how leaders act."\
\
Offering a third semester each year will help some students complete a nominal four-year degree in as little as three years, saving them time and money, and it will give others the chance to take advantage of study-abroad and internship opportunities. When fully implemented, the trimester initiative could mean $40 million in additional revenue for the university and would make better use of classrooms, residence halls and other campus facilities during the summer months.\
\
"This initiative will make a Purdue education more affordable because a greater array of summer course and program offerings, combined with discounted summer tuition, will result in a faster time to completion for some students," said Tim Sands, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs.\
\
Purdue's fall and spring tuition schedule for the main campus in West Lafayette is already designed to encourage full course loads by offering credits above eight for no additional charge. In addition, students taking from eight to 16 credits in the summer receive a discount relative to fall and spring rates; that discount is as high as 50 percent for students who take eight or nine credits in the summer. In embarking on this more aggressive efficiency and opportunity initiative, Purdue is exploring ideas for further incentives, course packages and scholarships, along with financial models that encourage departments to implement summer academic programs to jump-start the trimester initiative.\

\
"Purdue's decision to move toward a full-summer trimester offers students expanded opportunities to accelerate graduation and save money and is aligned with the commission's goals of increasing completion and ensuring affordability," said Teresa Lubbers, Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education.\
\
Jamie Merisotis, Lumina Foundation president and CEO, said, "Lumina Foundation is honored to host the announcement of Purdue's new trimester effort. We applaud Purdue University and President C\'f3rdova's plan to accelerate the time-to-degree. This is an innovative approach and reflects a strong commitment to serving students and the state of Indiana."\
\
The project is a key part of the decadal funding plan to increase sources of revenue beyond tuition and state appropriations - the traditional sources for public university funding - by doubling revenue capacity through continued cost-cutting, expanding online degree and professional education offerings, encouraging more robust use of campus facilities through summer teaching and learning, and ramping up research commercialization.\
\
Purdue trustee JoAnn Brouillette said the trimester effort was attractive to trustees because it would benefit students and the university's bottom line.\
\
"The advantages for students are several, and it helps the university financially while making better use of buildings and equipment," she said. "The additional revenue will help cut our cost per credit hour."\
\
C\'f3rdova said, "We've made a commitment to students and the state Legislature that Purdue will do everything possible to keep tuition affordable and still deliver an exceptional education and a valuable degree."\
\
Currently, 6,000 students take summer classes at Purdue's main campus for an average of four to five credit hours each. The goal is to grow the summer trimester to more than 20,000 students by 2022.\
\
Although savings for students and the institution would accrue from year-round utilization of facilities, expenses also would grow, with additional pay needed for professors and support staff. Financial aid also would need attention since most programs typically cover only two semesters in an academic year.\
\
One option for additional Indiana student support will be Purdue's Indiana Challenge scholarship program. C\'f3rdova announced this summer that $7 million earned through university investments would be used to boost private donations for student support, with $300,000 dedicated to support veterans and their dependents and $6.7 million for the scholarship-matching program.\
\
The Purdue Indiana Challenge Match will contribute to the Access and Success student scholarship and programming campaign. The campaign brought in $42.6 million in 2010-2011, for a four-year campaign total of $170.6 million towards the $304 million goal by 2014. The campaign supports the Presidential and Trustees Scholarships, Marquis Scholarships for middle-income students, and the Emerging Urban Leaders Scholarships for students from targeted urban areas.\

Study shines light on ways to cut costs for greenhouse growers\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Greenhouse bedding plant growers can save themselves time, money or possibly both by giving cuttings in propagation more light, according to a Purdue University study.\
\
Flower growers use cuttings from Central America and Africa to start spring bedding plants in greenhouses during winter and early spring. Those cloudy days and cool temperatures make propagation time- and energy-intensive.\
\
Roberto Lopez, an assistant professor of horticulture, and horticulture graduate students Chris Currey and Veronica Hutchinson study ways to minimize inputs and production costs in the floriculture industry while improving product quality. Based on what they were hearing from growers, they realized that light wasn't getting the attention it needed from the industry.\
\
"In their minds, temperature has always been the most important thing. They didn't think about light," Lopez said. "We knew that light was significant, but we realize we didn't know what level to recommend."\
\
Currey said growers were concerned that using too much light would stress the cuttings and disrupt root development.\
\
"The dogma has been to keep light low, but that actually made the cuttings take longer to root," said Currey, whose findings were published in the January issue of the journal HortScience.\
\
Currey, Hutchinson and Lopez propagated nine popular spring bedding plants under differing amounts of light for two weeks. They took a quality index used in forestry and modified it for bedding plants to assess the quality of the plants based on the light levels. They measured stem length, stem caliper, shoot dry mass and root dry mass.\
\
Overall, plants rooted faster with more light and the plants were higher quality. Both factors could increase profits for greenhouse growers, Lopez said.\
\
"With reduced production time, you can save on production costs or increase your crop production by starting another second crop that wouldn't have been possible with reduced light," Currey said. "That's increased profits through greenhouse space savings or energy savings, as well as through a higher quality product."\
\
A copy of the paper, with more specific light requirements, can be viewed at https://sharepoint.agriculture.purdue.edu/agriculture/flowers/publications.aspx\
\
Next, Lopez and Currey plan to study the morphological and physiological changes associated with light and cutting propagation, as well as how LED lights can be used to add supplemental daily light for cuttings.\
\
The Fred C. Glockner Foundation, U.S. Department of Agriculture Specialty Crop Research Initiative and the Indiana Flower Growers Association funded this research.\

ABSTRACT\
\
Growth Morphology, and Quality of Rooted Cuttings of Several \
Herbaceous Annual Bedding Plants Are Influenced by Photosynthetic \
Daily Light Integral During Root Development\
\
Christopher J. Currey, Veronica A. Hutchinson and Roberto G. Lopez\
\
Cuttings of herbaceous annual bedding plants must be rooted in late winter and early spring when ambient outdoor photosynthetic daily light integrals (DLIs) are at seasonally low levels. We evaluated the effect of DLI during root development on growth, morphology, and quality of nine popular vegetatively propagated annual bedding plant species. Cuttings of Angelonia angustifolia Benth. 'AngelMist White Cloud,' Argyranthemum frutescens (L.) Sch. Bip. 'Madeira Cherry Red,' Diascia barberae Hook. f. 'Wink Coral,' Lantana camara L. 'Lucky Gold,' Nemesia fruticans (Thunb.) Benth. 'Aromatica Royal,' Osteospermum ecklonis (DC.) Norl. 'Voltage Yellow,' Scaevola L. hybrid 'Blue Print,' Sutera cordata Roth. 'Abunda Giant White,' and Verbena Ruiz \'d7hybrida 'Aztec Violet' were harvested and propagated in a glass-glazed greenhouse with 23 \'b0C air and substrate temperature set points. After callusing (\uc0\u8776 5 mol\'b7m\u8722 2\'b7d\u8722 1 for 7 days), cuttings of each species were placed under one of three different fixed-woven shade cloths providing \u8776 38%, 61%, or 86% shade or no shade with 16 h of supplemental light for 14 days. There were no clear trends across species for stem length in response to DLI. Stem caliper of Argyranthemum, Diascia, and Nemesia increased by 35%, 119%, and 89%, respectively, as DLI increased from 1.2 to 12.3 mol\'b7m\u8722 2\'b7d\u8722 1. Depending on species, total, shoot, and root dry mass increased by 64% to 465%, 50% to 384%, and 156% to 1137%, respectively, as DLI increased from 1.2 to 12.3 mol\'b7m\u8722 2\'b7d\u8722 1. The quality index, an objective, integrated, and quantitative measurement of rooted cutting quality, increased for all species by 176% to 858% as DLI increased from 1.2 to 12.3 mol\'b7m\u8722 2\'b7d\u8722 1. Our results indicate that providing a DLI of \u8776 8 to 12 mol\'b7m\u8722 2\'b7d\u8722 1 after callusing increases both growth and quality of rooted cuttings.\

iPad pharmacy checklist could be prescription for better health\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A quick, interactive survey taken on an iPad could help pharmacists and patients better use their brief time together to catch and eliminate harmful drug side effects.\
\
Matthew Murawski, a Purdue University associate professor of pharmacy administration, created a new tool that presents patients with a five-question checklist that catches up to 60 percent of all known medication side effects.\
\
"Many patients do not mention side effects to their doctor or pharmacist because they either don't recognize that they are connected to the medication or they consider them the cost they must pay to keep from being ill or dying," Murawski said. "In addition, patients who are experiencing side effects are less likely to take the medication as prescribed or may stop taking the medication altogether, which can lead to catastrophic health consequences. Pharmacists can work with patients to eliminate most of these side effects, but they can't help if they don't know what the patient is experiencing."\
\
Exponential growth in the traffic at pharmacies over the past few decades has slashed the time pharmacists have with each patient to an average of two minutes - one third of what the counseling time was 20 years ago - and a system was needed to help make the discovery of adverse reactions easier and more efficient, he said.\
\
"With all of the training and education invested in every pharmacist, I honestly believe they are the most underutilized health-care practitioners," Murawski said. "This tool makes the few minutes available for counseling much more rewarding. The checklist results allow the pharmacist to immediately see side effects the patient is experiencing and target their time to solving these problems and improving the patient's quality of life."\
\
Pharmacists may suggest simple changes like taking a medication after meals or avoiding certain foods, or they can work with a patient's physician to change medications or develop a different therapy plan, he said.\
\
When a patient arrives at a pharmacy they could be handed an iPad with the checklist to fill out while they wait. A list of medications, including both the generic and brand names, is presented on the first screen and the pharmacist selects the medication the patient is taking. A patient is then presented with yes-or-no questions that cover the most common and serious side effect symptoms and the degree to which the problems are experienced. Once the checklist is complete, the iPad is returned to the pharmacist. The results are displayed as colored bars that show which side effects occurred and which are most problematic.\
\
After each consultation, the pharmacist resets the checklist before the next patient uses the iPad. Because the patient does not enter any identifying information and the checklist results are not saved, the same iPad can be used by multiple patients without the risk of revealing private information. Patients would have the option of allowing their anonymous results to be collected for further research into the incidence of adverse reactions and harmful side effects.\
\
Murawski's method, named Pharmaceutical Therapy-Related Quality of Life or PTRQoL, began as paper checklists that took up multiple file folders behind a pharmacist's desk. Mark Sharp, director of Purdue's Hook Teleproduction Center, helped automate the paper checklist and created the user interface and software that is compatible with iPads and other tablet devices and platforms.\
\
Side effects from medication use in the general population are not routinely tracked and reported. The results of clinical trials and the federal government's adverse event notification system were the only sources of such information when Murawski began his research two years ago. These represent the extremes of the best and worst conditions, he said.\
\
"Clinical trials involve ideal conditions in which preselected patients take the drugs exactly according to direction, and the adverse event notification system is used only for really severe problems," Murawski said. "These results do not necessarily translate to the reality of use in the general public. I wanted to know the sharp end of the spear - what was actually happening in the pharmacies and with the average person."\
\
A seed grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. through Purdue's College of Pharmacy funded Murawski's investigation into the side effects being experienced by patients at 10 community pharmacies in Indiana.\
\
Murawski focused his study on the top 200 most-dispensed drugs in the United States, which account for 90 percent of the volume in pharmacies. He sorted these medications by their drug classes and then cataloged all of the potential side effects for each class.\
\
From the 2,000 surveys completed at the sites, Murawski found that approximately 50 percent of patients reported experiencing a symptom that could be a drug-related side effect, and pharmacists were able to confirm 20 percent of these were directly tied to medication use. He extracted the incidence rates of each side effect and created a new checklist weighted by the severity of the problem and the most common problems experienced.\
\
Sometimes side-effect symptoms can be a sign of something more serious, including taking an improper dose of the drug, an interaction with another medication or a harmful drug reaction. The sooner a pharmacist or physician can detect such problems, the better, Murawski said.\
\
In addition to health risks, such problems can be expensive. According to a study published in the Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association, the cost associated with managing drug-related problems exceeded $177.4 billion in 2000.\
\
The costs to people's health and the health-care system from patients not taking a drug as prescribed or discontinuing a medication without consulting a health-care practitioner have not been well documented. A study by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research that examined drug compliance for patients suffering from diabetes or osteoporosis found that the rate of hospitalization increased as adherence to a medication regimen dropped and overall medical charges were much higher for those who did not take medication as prescribed.\
\
"If someone stops taking a drug as prescribed for a chronic condition there will be health consequences immediately or years down the road," Murawski said. "The detrimental health effects could lead to hospitalizations or the development of another illness, and this can be very expensive for both the individual and the health-care system as whole. It is very important to try to work with someone to solve any issues that could keep them from taking a drug as prescribed."\
\
In addition to the iPad tool, Murawski sees the potential for a kiosk version that could be integrated with a pharmacy's computer system. A patient could swipe an ID card or type in their name and the system would tailor the checklist to their medication records. He also hopes pharmacies could incorporate the results into a patient's record and maintain an ongoing history that would allow for more in-depth questions with each subsequent visit.\
\
"Currently we present a patient with five questions that get about 50 to 60 percent of all side effects," he said. "If we have more time and can continue down the list of questions and get more specific, we could capture all known side effects."\
\
Murawski plans to continue to accumulate checklist results and gather data about the incidence and severity of medication side effects in the general population and to further refine the PTRQoL tool.\
\
PTRQoL is available for licensing through Matt McFarland, associate director of commercialization in the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization, at 765-588-3487, mjmcfarland@prf.org\

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 Zygmunt Pizlo and his research team glide across a parquet dance floor - not in some club for a night on the town, but in his Purdue University Visual Perception Lab as part of critical research for a technology that is ready to be licensed and commercialized.\
\
They're moving so a robot named \uc0\u268 apek can "watch" them and conceptualize the research team's actions as members move around objects like desks and chairs. The goal is to simulate visual perception in the robot so it can "see" more like humans.\
\
"Enabling robots and other machines to see the world in 3-D like humans is one of the biggest challenges in robotics and artificial intelligence," said Pizlo, a professor in the Purdue Department of Psychological Sciences. "Research in the field of robotic vision has typically focused on recording and analyzing 2-D images, but really it is about 3-D visual perception - being able to understand the 3-D scene in front of the robot so that it can decide what needs to be done with an object that is in its field of view. Should the robot walk around it? Pick it up?"\
\
Pizlo has been working in the field of visual perception for 30 years.\
\
"We believe there is a fundamental principle for human vision and that is we rely on a prior knowledge about a physical environment, so we're trying to program this knowledge of the physical environment into a robot's artificial intelligence," he said.\
\
Pizlo said work in the lab is to develop a model of decision-making to mimic the human mind.\
\
"We're developing a technology that will allow robotic machines to map their environment using two cameras for eyes," he said. "This process eliminates the need for additional range sensors currently used for robotic vision and reduces the time and complexity of robotic sight."\
\
Postdoctoral research assistants Tadamasa Sawada and Yunfeng Li are working with Pizlo. Sawada said humans have the ability for cognitive functions that are computationally difficult, and it is a challenge to incorporate that ability into a robot.\

\
"We quickly and easily perceive the physical world - a 3-D shape and figure-ground organization," Sawada said. "Figure-ground organization is key to seeing an object in 3-D instead of 2-D."\
\
Figure-ground perception is the tendency of a human's visual system to simplify a scene or photo into a main object and cognitively "move" everything else into the background.\
\
"The question is how do we have a robot solve figure-ground organization like we do?" he said. "We do this by incorporating visual mechanisms and a prior knowledge about the physical environment into a robot."\
\
Conventional robotic vision technology uses multiple cameras with laser range finders and other sensors to detect objects around them. While the current systems allow for basic object recognition, they do not replicate the 3-D capabilities that are possible for humans, according to Pizlo.\
\
"The key element in solving the puzzle of enabling 3-D vision for robots is to realize that our visual system uses a prior knowledge about the physical world. We are implementing this knowledge, as well as the visual mechanisms (algorithms) in a robot," said Pizlo, who also is a professor of electrical and computer engineering. "The physical world is not completely random. Most natural objects are symmetrical, all objects have volume, gravity is always present, ground surfaces are approximately horizontal. There is enough prior knowledge in the human visual system that we automatically see everything in 3-D. Combining a prior knowledge with visual information helps robots see the same way we do."\
\
Enabling the human/robot connection will be a key factor in bringing robots into everyday life.\
\
"Right now robots are used in a number of ways, including manufacturing, space research, agriculture and even cleaning our floors, but they can't bring us coffee in the morning," he said. "Until they can see like us, they can't truly interact with us. Once they can interact with us they can begin doing all types of tasks such as drive a car, help surgeons in hospitals, assist the elderly, provide sight for the blind, replace people in high-risk situations like making repairs in a nuclear plant and, yes, bring us coffee in the morning."\
\
The patent-pending technology is available for licensing through Eric Lynch at 765-588-3477, eslynch@prf.org, in the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization.\
\
Funding for Pizlo' s research came from the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Defense, Air Force Office of Scientic Research, U.S. Department of Energy and other sources.\

What to expect of weather for Super Bowl week? Look at history\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 The state climatologist has some insight on the weather that visitors to Indianapolis might expect during a week of activities leading up to the Super Bowl on Feb. 5.\
\
The Indiana State Climate Office, based at Purdue University, has prepared a website of historical weather statistics for Indianapolis from Jan. 30 to Feb. 5 going back to 1943, the earliest year for which data were available. The site, called "Super Five of February 5," is at http://iclimate.org/centralindiana.asp\
\
The site is named "Super Five" because it includes the five years that had the most extreme weather on Feb. 5. The warmest high temperature on that date was 65 degrees Fahrenheit in 2008; the lowest cold temperature was minus-16 degrees in 1979.\
\
Using the last 10 years of weather data as a benchmark, those walking the downtown streets from event to event could expect a daily high temperature of about 39 degrees and a nighttime low near 22, according to the office's analysis of the statistics.\
\
Snowfall the past 10 years during that week in Indianapolis has ranged from zero to 5.3 inches, with an average of 2.1 inches. The most snow cover was 8.3 inches in 2009, but about 1.8 inches of snow on the ground is normal for the week.\
\
The temperature and precipitation won't matter much to the fans once they arrive at Lucas Oil Stadium to see the game between the New York Giants and the New England Patriots. It will be played indoors, where the forecast is for short-sleeve temperatures and dry conditions, except for the moment when the tub of icy Gatorade is dumped on the winning coach.\

Tiny 'spherules' reveal details about Earth's asteroid impacts\
\
Researchers are learning details about asteroid impacts going back to the Earth's early history by using a new method for extracting precise information from tiny "spherules" embedded in layers of rock. The spherules were created when asteroids crashed into Earth, vaporizing rock that expanded as a giant vapor plume. Small droplets of molten rock in the plume condensed and solidified, falling back to the surface as a thin layer. This sample was found in Western Australia and formed 2.63 billion years ago in the aftermath of a large impact. (Oberlin College photo/Bruce M. Simonson)\

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 Researchers are learning detailsabout asteroid impacts going back to the Earth's early history by using a newmethod for extracting precise information from tiny "spherules"embedded in layers of rock.\
The spherules were created when asteroids crashed into theEarth, vaporizing rock that expanded into space as a giant vapor plume. Smalldroplets of molten and vaporized rock in the plume condensed and solidified,falling back to Earth as a thin layer. The round or oblong particles werepreserved in layers of rock, and now researchers have analyzed them to recordprecise information about asteroids impacting Earth from 3.5 billion to 35million years ago.\
\
"What we have done is provide the foundation forunderstanding how to interpret the layers in terms of the size and velocity ofthe asteroid that made them," said Jay Melosh, an expert in impactcratering and a distinguished professor of earth and atmospheric sciences,physics and aerospace engineering at Purdue University.\
\
Findings, which support a theory that the Earth endured anespecially heavy period of asteroid bombardment early in its history, aredetailed in a research paper appearing online in the journal Nature on Wednesday (April 25). Thepaper was written by Purdue physics graduate student Brandon Johnson and Melosh.The findings, based on geologic observations, support a theoretical study in acompanion paper in Nature byresearchers at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo.\
\
The period of heavy asteroid bombardment - from 4.2 to 3.5billion years ago - is thought to have been influenced by changes in the earlysolar system that altered the trajectory of objects in an asteroid belt locatedbetween Mars and Jupiter, sending them on a collision course with Earth.\
\
"That's the postulate, and this is the first realsolid evidence that it actually happened," Melosh said. "Some of theasteroids that we infer were about 40 kilometers in diameter, much larger thanthe one that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago that was about12-15 kilometers. But when we looked at the number of impactors as a functionof size, we got a curve that showed a lot more small objects than large ones, apattern that matches exactly the distribution of sizes in the asteroid belt.For the first time we have a direct connection between the crater sizedistribution on the ancient Earth and the sizes of asteroids out inspace."\
\
Because craters are difficult to study directly, impacthistory must be inferred either by observations of asteroids that periodicallypass near the Earth or by studying craters on the moon. Now, the new techniqueusing spherules offers a far more accurate alternative to chronicle asteroidimpacts on Earth, Melosh said.\
\
"We can look at these spherules, see how thick thelayer is, how big the spherules are, and we can infer the size and velocity ofthe asteroid," Melosh said. "We can go back to the earliest era inthe history of the Earth and infer the population of asteroids impacting theplanet."\
\
For asteroids larger than about 10 kilometers in diameter,the spherules are deposited in a global layer.\
\
"Some of these impacts were several times larger thanthe Chicxulub impact that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago,"Johnson said. "The impacts may have played a large role in the evolutionalhistory of life. The large number of impacts may have helped simple life byintroducing organics and other important materials at a time when life on Earthwas just taking hold."\
\
A 40-kilometer asteroid would have wiped out everything onthe Earth's surface, whereas the one that struck 65 million years ago killedonly land animals weighing more than around 20 kilograms.\
\
"Impactcraters are the most obvious indication of asteroid impacts, but craters onEarth are quickly obscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonicprocesses," Johnson said. "However, the spherule layers, if preservedin the geologic record, provide information about an impact even when thesource crater cannot be found."\
\
The Purdue researchers studied the spherules usingcomputer models that harness mathematical equations developed originally tocalculate the condensation of vapor.\
\
"There have been some new wrinkles in vaporcondensation modeling that motivated us to do this work, and we were the firstto apply it to asteroid impacts," Melosh said.\
\
The spherules are about a millimeter in diameter.\
\
The researchers also are studying a different type ofartifact similar to spherules but found only near the original impact site.Whereas the globally distributed spherules come from the condensing vaporizedrock, these "melt droplets" are from rock that's been melted and notcompletely vaporized.\
\
"Before this work, it was not possible to distinguishbetween these two types of formations," Melosh said. "Nobody hadestablished criteria for discriminating between them, and we've done thatnow."\
\
One of the authors of the Southwest Research Institutepaper, David Minton, is now an assistant professor of earth and atmosphericsciences at Purdue.\
\
Findings from the research may enable Melosh's team toenhance an asteroid impact effects calculator he developed to estimate whatwould happen if asteroids of various sizes were to hit the Earth. Thecalculator, "Impact: Earth!" allows anyone to calculate potentialcomet or asteroid damage based on the object's mass.\
\
The research has been funded by NASA.\

Impact Spherules: Record of an Ancient Heavy Bombardment of Earth\

\
Impact craters are themost obvious indication of asteroid impacts, but craters on Earth are quicklyobscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonic processes1. Earth'simpact history is inferred therefore either from estimates of the present-dayimpactor flux as determined by observations of near-Earth asteroids, or fromthe Moon's incomplete impact chronology. Asteroids hitting Earth typicallyvaporize a mass of target rock comparable to the projectile's mass. As this vaporexpands in a large plume or fireball, it cools and condenses into moltendroplets called spherules. For asteroids larger than about 10 kilometers indiameter, these spherules are deposited in a global layer. Spherule layerspreserved in the geologic record accordingly provide information about animpact even when the source crater cannot be found. Here, we report estimatesof the sizes and impact velocities of the asteroids that created globalspherule layers. The impact chronology from these spherule layers reveals thatthe impactor flux was significantly higher 3.5 billion years ago than it isnow. This conclusion is consistent with a gradual decline of the impactor fluxafter the Late Heavy Bombardment.\

Purdue announces energy master plan, seeks public comment\
\
\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University is accepting comments on its Comprehensive Energy Master Plan that was presented Tuesday (Jan. 10) to the Board of Trustees' Physical Facilities Committee.\
\
The plan was designed to meet the university's future energy needs in an affordable and sustainable manner. For the next 30 days, beginning Wednesday (Jan. 11), the public can review and comment on the plan at http://www.purdue.edu/ees/cemp\
\
Trustees requested the plan last February. Robert McMains, vice president for physical facilities, said his department worked to craft an energy plan that includes stakeholder input and aligns with the university's existing New Synergies and sustainability strategic plans.\
\
"We intend to implement several of the plan's recommendations to improve operating performance in ways that meet increased demand, contain costs and maintain the environment," McMains said. "Because the energy industry is so dynamic, we will revisit and update the plan as needed."\
\
Purdue currently is replacing a coal boiler with a natural gas boiler, and staff members continually seek ways to reduce campus energy usage. A number of planned new campus buildings will increase demands on the university's heating and cooling capacity, which led to several of the plan's recommendations, including:\
\
* Replace Boiler No. 1 with a combined heat and power (CHP) unit by 2014. A CHP is a natural gas-fired turbine similar to a jet engine that also produces electricity. * Replace coal-fired Boiler No. 2 with a cleaner-burning alternative. \
* Build a second satellite chiller plant and add electric water chillers to augment building cooling capacity. \
* Build an 8,000-ton thermal energy storage tank that will allow water to be chilled overnight when electric rates are lower, and then use the chilled water to cool buildings during the day. \
* Increase and improve distribution systems to deliver steam from the Wade Utility plant on the south end of campus to buildings and residences on the north end, and move chilled water eastward from the Northwest Satellite Chiller Plant.\
\
Those making comments on the plan must submit their name, mailing address, a valid email address, their designation (Purdue student, faculty or staff; in-state community member; or out-of-state community member), and whether they are commenting as an individual or on behalf of a group. Comments can also be mailed to Senior Director Energy, Engineering and Sustainability, Frehafer Hall of Administrative Services, 2nd floor, 401 S. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2024.\
\
Comments, limited to three minutes per person, also will be received at a public meeting from 7-8 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 15, in Stewart Center, Room 310. Those wanting to comment at the public meeting must preregister by noon on Tuesday, Feb. 14, by contacting Debbie Johnson at 765-494-2306 from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays.\
\
All comments become public record and may be incorporated into the energy plan's final report to be compiled by consultant Burns & McDonnell.\

IVDiagnostics opens office in Purdue Research Park of Northwest Indiana\
\
IVDiagnostics LLC has developed a system that includes proprietary software to measure and monitor the level of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in a patient's bloodstream. The company has opened an office in the Purdue Research Park of Northwest Indiana. (IVDiagnostics photo)\

\
MERRILLVILLE, Ind. - A company that develops, tests and markets diagnostic tools that measure and monitor cancer tumor cells is expanding its presence in Northwest Indiana by opening an office in the Purdue Research Park of Northwest Indiana.\
\
IVDiagnostics LLC has developed tools that target circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which are released from primary cancer tumors into the bloodstream and then lodge at distant organs to begin new cancer growth. Health-care providers use the information to determine the effectiveness of cancer treatments. The company was founded by Frank Szczepanski, Tom Szczepanski and Wei He in 2008. Frank Szczepanski is president and CEO.\
\
"Our IVD CTC Assay is an in vitro assay that specifically measures circulating tumor cells in a patient's blood sample. It assists clinicians with monitoring tumor cells in real time, providing them a tool to determine the effectiveness of therapy," Frank Szczepanski said. "The IVDxTx platform is our in vivo device that monitors a patient's CTC level and performs real-time diagnosis without taking blood. Clinicians can monitor these cells with higher sensitivity, less patient anxiety and greater ease of use over other tools."\
\
Frank Szczepanski said current methods to diagnose cancer have drawbacks compared to IVDiagnostics' tools.\
\
"Clinicians currently use cancer assays like the test for prostate cancer that measures antigen or rejection response in the bloodstream," he said. "These are indirect signs of cancer tumors, unlike CTCs, so they may not be as accurate as our tools."\
\
He said IVDiagnostics has completed pre-clinical studies and looks to launch its first pilot trial with human cancer patients.\
\
"The trial will be conducted with breast cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer patients to determine if there is more sensitivity with one type of cancer or the other based on the results," he said. "My colleagues and I then will decide which cancer type to move forward with for a pivotal trial."\
\
Szczepanski said IVDiagnostics is expanding, but not moving its entire operation by opening an office at the Purdue Research Park of Northwest Indiana.\
\
\'a0"The facility in Merrillville will help us have closer ties and proximity to our medical partners in Northwest Indiana," he said.\
\
IVDiagnostics has been recognized in the Congressional Record, and has received awards from the Northwest Indiana Society of Innovators (Chanute Prize), Northwest Indiana Small Business Development Center (Revolutionary Technology award) and the World Future Society (Top 15 Beta Futurist award).\
\
About IVDiagnostics LLC\
\
IVDiagnostics was formed to develop, test and market more effective diagnostic tools for addressing rare circulating tumor cells and blood borne diseases. By collaborating with several academic and commercial partners, the company has accelerated its research and development.\
\
Within a short period of time, IVDiagnostics has assembled a team of researchers, scientists, medical advisers, scientific advisers and clinicians - all passionate about moving toward personalized medicine and focused on assisting physicians with the knowledge of ''what's inside" the body, and providing the ability to monitor the patient's circulatory system with minimally invasive techniques.\
\

New hire to help students with off-campus housing\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - University Residences and Purdue's dean of students have teamed up to create a new position to help students navigate the world of off-campus housing.\
\
Ashley Darnell, who previously worked in a similar capacity at the University of Pennsylvania, started Jan. 3 as Purdue's new assistant director of off-campus student services.\
\
Darnell's job is to help students make informed decisions when deciding between on- and off-campus housing and to help them understand the often-complicated process of securing the latter, said Bob Heitert, director of administration for University Residences.\
\
The idea to create the position arose last year when it became apparent that more freshmen would be living off campus because the class size was larger than normal, Heitert said. Also, Barbara Frazee, director of University Residences, and Danita Brown, dean of students, wanted to provide students living off-campus with more resources.\
\
"The creation of this position was aimed at students living off campus in general, but there also were some very specific groups we all agreed needed attention, including international students," Heitert said. "Also, in University Residences we house about 90 percent of the incoming student class. We felt the other 10 percent needed a resource to help with housing, too."\
\
Before coming to Purdue, Darnell most recently worked for five years as the coordinator of off-campus services at the University of Pennsylvania. Before that, he worked as a residence coordinator at Florida State University and as a community director at George Washington University.\
\
This month, Darnell will begin coordinating residence hall programming at Purdue. It will offer students information, including the pros and cons of off-campus and on-campus housing, how to go about securing off-campus housing, and how to approach landlord-tenant issues.\
\
In addition to helping students feel more comfortable with the off-campus housing process, Darnell's work will help support the students' academics, he said.\
\
"If we can assist them so that they're not having issues with housing - on campus or off - certainly there's a benefit because it allows them to focus on their academics," Darnell said.\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University opened its ADMAgricultural Innovation Center on Wednesday (Jan.18), heralding it as offeringgreater laboratory and classroom opportunities for students in the university'stop-rated Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. \'a0\
\
The $4.2 million, 27,000-square-foot center was built witha $1.5 million contribution from Archer Daniels Midland Co., a longstandingpartner with Purdue in the education of agricultural and biological engineeringand agricultural systems management students. Construction of the steel-framebuilding on the south side of campus began last spring.\
\
"This building reflects the commitment and dedicationof Purdue and ADM to further enhance the experience of students in ournationally recognized undergraduate and graduate programs in agricultural andbiological engineering," said university President France A. C\'f3rdova. "Thisfacility will help ensure that these programs will continue to produce theinnovators that the industry needs."\
\
U.S. News & World Report in September rated Purdue'sDepartment of Agricultural and Biological Engineering as the best such undergraduatespecialty program in the country. Earlier in the year, it also ranked the graduate program as the top ABE specialty.\
\
The center, which replaces a small, outdated building,provides opportunities for students to use the largest tractors, combines andother agricultural machinery to better understand the operation of theequipment and its components, document performance and improve designs.Equipment considered small by today's standards did not fit in the previousshop.\
\
The space includes classrooms for students to interact insmall groups, using computers, LCD panels and writable walls so they cancomplete assignments, develop designs and build equipment in the shop area.\
\
There also is a conference room where students can meetwith industrial project sponsors and potential employers.\
\
"The facility provides a broad range of experiencesand opportunities for students all in one place," said department headBernard Engel.\
\
ADM's contribution, to be given over three years, isfunded through ADM Cares, which directs up to 1 percent of the company's pretaxprofits to initiatives and organizations that drive social, economic andenvironmental progress worldwide.\

Weather brings out emerald ash borer earlier this year\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 The tree-killing emerald ash boreris emerging about a month ahead of schedule in Indiana because of the earlywarm weather, leading a Purdue Extension entomologist to urge homeowners totake steps now to protect their trees.\
Homeowners who want to protect their ash trees withinsecticides need to start applying them as soon as possible, Cliff Sadof said.That is because adult borers typically take flight about the same time thatblack locust trees bloom - a process which has started as a result of favorabletemperatures for both.\
\
"Black locust bloom has begun to occur in many partsof the state," Sadof said. "Eggs laid by adult borers will producegrubs that start drilling into ash trees in about a month."\
\
Indiana residents seeking advice should look to the Purduewebsite http://www.eabindiana.info. Resources are available on how to identifyash trees, determine whether trees are infested and how to take care of theproblem themselves or hire a professional applicator.\
\
Infested ash trees have several visible symptoms:\
\
* Branches showing thin foliage at the very top of thetrees.\
\
* The presence of woodpecker holes, the result ofwoodpeckers feeding on EAB larvae under the bark.\
\
* Splits in the bark that reveal curvy trails the insectsleave.\
\
* D-shaped holes the borers make when they leave the tree.Because the tee-chewing beetle first attacks treetops, the holes often are toohigh up to see until the tree is nearly dead.\
\
\

\
The number of ash trees with symptoms in a neighborhoodusually doubles every year. This means that from the time enough trees aredamaged to draw attention to the problem, it takes 3-4 years for all theremaining ash trees to be killed.\
\
"The cost of keeping communities safe from the limbsthat fall from dying trees can be devastating since over 80 percent of treesdie in the last three years of the local invasion," Sadof said.\
\
Sadof has posted a cost calculator on the website to helpcommunities plan their response to EAB. Planning is critical to lowering annualexpenses associated with EAB management.\
\
"Most people are surprised to learn that usinginsecticides to save trees during the initial invasion is much less expensivethan removing and replacing trees," Sadof said.\'a0 "This is because after all the untreated trees havedied, most of the remaining beetles starve to death or are killed when feedingon trees treated with insecticide."\
\
Annemarie Nagle, exotic forest pest outreach coordinatorfor Purdue's Department of Entomology, is heading a Purdue Extension programcalled Neighbors against Bad Bugs, or NABB, to help neighborhoods work togetherto lower tree management costs.\
\
"We have been working in communities throughoutIndiana to show people how EAB will affect their neighborhood," saidNagle. "Bringing this issue to the forefront before trees start dying willencourage people to act now so they can save money and save trees."\
\
Although insecticides are the only tool available forhomeowners, Sadof has been working with the Indiana Department of NaturalResources and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service for the release of stingless wasps throughout the state tohelp kill the beetle in rural areas.\
\
The emerald ash borer has killedmillions of ash trees in the U.S. since its arrival in Detroit in 2002. InIndiana, the most extensive damage has been in the northeast, including FortWayne. Most of the state north of Interstate 70 or east Indianapolis generallyis infested.\
\
When the EAB arrived, Indiana had nearly 150 million ashtrees, at least 5 million in cities. In most cities, at least one out of everyfive trees on the streets is an ash tree.\

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A team from the Purdue Society of Professional Engineers and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers on Saturday (Feb. 25) won the 30th annual Purdue Regional Rube Goldberg Machine Contest with a machine that traces the competition's history.\
\
The Rube Goldberg competition, sponsored by Phi Chapter of Theta Tau fraternity, rewards machines that most effectively combine creativity with inefficiency and complexity. The task this year was to inflate and pop a balloon.\
\
The winning machine took 300 steps to do 25 different tasks - this year's challenge and 24 past challenges, including changing a light bulb, shutting off an alarm clock and peeling an apple.\
\
Last year, the same team created a machine that had 244 steps, winning it a spot in the "Guinness Book of World Records" for most steps by a Rube Goldberg machine.\
\
To break that record with this year's machine, the team had to complete a run with no human interventions. That didn't happen Saturday when a part feeding a steam boiler failed. The team was required to go to its Plan B, an air pump to inflate the balloon, which required a human touch to start it.\
\
Zach Umperovitch, president of the team, said the 14 team members spent 5,000 combined hours building the machine.\
\
Machines must use at least 20 steps to complete the task in no more than two minutes. Teams have three tries to complete two runs. Points are deducted if students have to assist the machine once it has started.\
\
The winning machine completed all three runs. Its best run took one minute, 38 seconds with two human interventions.\
\
The PSPE/SHPE machine required a unique design to fit all of its steps into the framework limits, Umperovitch said. The top half of the machine rotates horizontally to accommodate some of the many tasks it accomplishes.\
\
The team now will compete in the national Rube Goldberg contest, to be held at Purdue on March 31.\
\
"We'll replace the boiler hoses. Other than that, we'll just make some tweaks before the national contest," Umperovitch said.\
\
The PSPE/SHPE team also won the people's choice award, voted on by the audience.\
\
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers took second place with a machine based on Looney Tunes cartoon characters.\
\
A machine by the Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists and the Society of Black Engineers took third with a Mayan calendar-end of the world theme.\
\
Sponsors for this year's event are Alcoa, Lockheed Martin, Priio, Rockwell Collins, Omega Engineering, and the Purdue Colleges of Engineering and Technology and the School of Mechanical Engineering.\
\
Four high schools also participated in a regional Rube Goldberg Machine contest at Purdue on Saturday (Feb. 25).\
\
The winner was Anderson High School. That team will go to the national contest March 17 at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Mich.\
\
Marion's Eastbrook High School took second place. Owen Valley High School, Spencer, was third. Kouts High School also participated.\
\
The high school event was coordinated by the Purdue Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists.\
\
Goldberg specialized in drawing whimsical machines with complex mechanisms to perform simple tasks. He earned a degree in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1904. He worked as an engineer for the city of San Francisco for less than a year before becoming a sports cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He received a Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for his political cartoons published by the New York Sun.\

Purdue professors to advance breast cancer research partnership through trip to Ghana\
\
Sophie Leli\'e8vre\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue professors Sophie A. Leli\'e8vre and Ellen Gruenbaum will travel to Africa this month to meet with officials of Peace and Love Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, and outline ways to advance a partnership on breast cancer research and awareness.\
\
Leli\'e8vre, associate professor of basic medical sciences in the School of Veterinary Medicine and associate director of Discovery Groups for the Purdue Center for Cancer Research, also will deliver a keynote lecture on international efforts to prevent breast cancer development to a panel of African health and public policy experts on Monday (Jan. 16) in Kumasi.\
\
"The incidence of breast cancer has risen rapidly in many African countries, and the World Health Organization is asking scientists from around the world to help shift efforts from detection toward primary prevention," said Leli\'e8vre (pronounced Le-LEE-YEA-vre). "That's because many developing countries will not be able to withstand the costs associated with the necessary heavy treatments, especially since women usually consult at advanced stages of the disease."\
\
Leli\'e8vre and Gruenbaum, with support from the Purdue Global Policy Research Institute, are researching how legal and cultural aspects impact policy decisions in terms of breast health in countries such as Ghana, Lebanon, France, Japan and Uruguay.\
\
Gruenbaum, a medical anthropologist and head of the Department of Anthropology, also will work on establishing a collaboration to study cultural and religious practices affecting breast health and dietary patterns.\
\
"Many African women are dying from breast cancer mainly because of a lack of understanding about the disease's early symptoms and beliefs about the effects of breast cancer," Gruenbaum said. "While the country's fatality rate from breast cancer is 10th highest in Africa, Ghanaian health-care officials and government leaders are working aggressively to raise awareness and educate women about how lives can be saved from early screening and treatment."\
\
During their visit to Ghana, Leli\'e8vre and Gruenbaum will meet with African breast cancer awareness leader Dr. Beatrice Wiafe-Addai, chief executive officer of Peace and Love Hospital. Wiafe-Addai also serves as president of Breast Care International, a non-governmental organization in Ghana, and has received several awards for her breast cancer awareness efforts.\
\
In addition, Wiafe-Addai chairs the Susan G. Komen Ghana Race for the Cure and the Ghana Breast Cancer Alliance and is vice president of the African Organization for Research and Training in Cancer Council for West Africa, known as AORTIC.\
\
An estimated 450,000 women die from breast cancer every year in Ghana, and about 5 million of its 22 million people are at high risk for the disease, said Leli\'e8vre, who also is a member of the Oncological Sciences Center in Purdue's Discovery Park.\
\
Leli\'e8vre and Connie Weaver, distinguished professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue, are leading a multinational initiative called the International Breast Cancer and Nutrition Project (IBCN) to learn more about the role that diet and other environmental factors can play to promote or prevent this disease.\
\
IBCN, involving the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, is focusing initial efforts on the United States and Ghana as well as France, Japan, Uruguay and Lebanon.\
\
Through the project launched in 2010, each country has a dedicated research team focused on a number of milestones and allows scientists to study worldwide diversity in breast cancer rates, dietary patterns and cultural contexts.\
\
The project is bringing together experts in nutrition, basic medical sciences, statistics, cancer epidemiology, communication, public policy, economics, health law, anthropology and medicine to study a variety of factors such as how cellular mechanisms in breast cancer development link to diet, as well as the role public policy plays in a population's available food source and disease prevention.\
\
Leli\'e8vre said another important objective is to identify the link between different types of breast cancer, nutrition and the epigenome, the latter of which determines how the genome is organized within cells to control the on-and-off switch of genes.\
\
The IBCN's annual conference returns to the Purdue campus this fall, following the 2011 event in France. Lebanon is scheduled to host the conference in 2013. Purdue hosted the inaugural conference in October 2010.\
\
Purdue's Global Policy Research Institute focuses on the university's strengths in science, information technology, data management and systems engineering in collaboration with economics and the social sciences to inform policymakers about critical issues such as food security and health.\
\
The institute has awarded $300,000 in grants to help Purdue professors establish seed projects to attract external funding for larger projects. Some of the supported topics include food security, disaster recovery, cancer prevention and sustainability. \

Global food security center hires manager, receives grants\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 The recently created Center for Global Food Security at Purdue University has hired a managing director and received grants totaling $10 million for work to improve crops in Africa and train the next generation of global food security experts.\
\
\
Gary Burniske\
Download Photo\
\
Gary Burniske, who had been director of Mercy Corps operations in Bogot\'e1, Colombia, since 2006, will run daily operations of the center at Discovery Park, a complex of organizations leading large-scale collaborative research on campus engaging faculty, students and industry in state, national and global partnerships and entrepreneurial education.\
\
"I envision the center being a catalyst for dramatic improvements in food security by sharing the tremendous wealth of knowledge and innovation generated at Purdue University," said Burniske, who started his new position Feb. 1. "I look forward to working with the Discovery Park team to achieve Purdue's vision as a global leader for solutions to social, economic and environmental challenges we face."\
\
Burniske's appointment comes at a time when the center, established in 2011, will begin work on two major projects that have received significant funding and align with two of the center's core mission areas - research and education:\
\
* A four-year, multidisciplinary research and development program on the control of the parasitic Striga weed, which infests sorghum and other crops in Africa, damaging or destroying them. The center received a $5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to further research and establish programs for a sustainable Striga control and institutional development effort in the African nations of Tanzania and Ethiopia.\
\
* A five-year effort to train U.S. graduate students in food security and global development in the fields of agriculture and natural resources. The U.S. Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security program is funded by a $5 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\
\
Both projects align with the center's objectives to advance global food security and develop leaders with the skills to help solve the world's hunger problems amid a growing population, said university President France A. C\'f3rdova.\
\
"Forging such large-scale partnerships goes to the core of Purdue's commitment to provide innovative, research-based solutions to problems facing our global society," C\'f3rdova said. "Purdue's Center for Global Food Security is rising to that challenge."\
\
The Striga research will build on the work of Gebisa Ejeta, the center's director and distinguished professor of agronomy who received the World Food Prize in 2009 for developing sorghum varieties resistant to drought and Striga in his native Africa, where sorghum is a major crop.\
\
The new effort will focus on furthering knowledge of biological interactions between Striga and sorghum through research in chemistry, molecular genetics and crop improvement.\
\
"In the previous research, we focused on controlling Striga through manipulation of resistance genes in the host plant," Ejeta said. "Now we will expand the research to explore the role of virulence genes in the pathogen to avoid catastrophic breakdown of resistance."\
\
Shorter-term solutions will involve establishing sustainable Striga control programs by adapting previously piloted Striga management technologies to the variety of environments and livelihoods of small-scale farmers in highly infested regions of Ethiopia and Tanzania.\
\
Ejeta will direct the project, which will include Tesfaye Mengiste, a Purdue professor of botany and plant pathology, and Harro Bouwmeester, who heads the Laboratory of Plant Physiology at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. They will collaborate with the agriculture ministries in Ethiopia and Tanzania.\
\
The Borlaug fellowship program will consist of:\
\
* A two-week Summer Institute on Global Food Security for 20-30 beginning graduate students. The training will provide an understanding of the array of issues involving food security. It will be conducted annually on the Purdue campus.\
\
* A dissertation research opportunity for U.S. graduate students to work in developing countries for 6-24 months, laying foundations for new and long-term collaborative research in food and natural resource systems between African nations and the United States.\
\
"Aptly named, the program is an ambitious effort to produce the next generation's Norman Borlaugs for the fight against hunger and to advance global development," said Ejeta, referring to the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize-winning plant scientist and humanitarian.\
\
The Borlaug program will be administered by Ejeta, Burniske and Rose Filley, managing director of Purdue's Global Sustainability Initiative.\

The Purdue Research Foundation-managed Trask Innovation Fund is a development program to assist faculty who have disclosed a discovery to the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization and are close to commercializing the discovery.\
\
"The Trask Innovation Fund is an important resource for Purdue researchers who are in the final stages of moving a discovery to the market but need short-term funding to finalize the research they have already conducted," said Joseph B. Hornett, senior vice president, treasurer and COO of the Purdue Research Foundation. "The Trask fund can be used to develop a prototype or compile data that demonstrates the commercial strength of an invention that makes a technology more marketable."\
\
Elizabeth Hart-Wells, assistant vice president and director of the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization, said Trask fund recipients came from various disciplines across the Purdue campus.\
\
"The faculty from the colleges of science, engineering, agriculture, pharmacy and other areas are represented in this round of Trask awards," Hart-Wells said. "Purdue is a recognized international leader for education and research, and we are constantly looking for strong ways to support and commercialize the important discoveries being developed at Purdue."\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\

Energy-dense biofuel from cellulose close to being economical\
\
\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 A new Purdue University-developed process for creating biofuels has shown potential to be cost-effective for production scale, opening the door for moving beyond the laboratory setting.\
\
A Purdue economic analysis shows that the cost of the thermo-chemical H2Bioil method is competitive when crude oil is about $100 per barrel when using certain energy methods to create hydrogen needed for the process. If a federal carbon tax were implemented, the biofuel would become even more economical.\
\
H2Bioil is created when biomass, such as switchgrass or corn stover, is heated rapidly to about 500 degrees Celcius in the presence of pressurized hydrogen. Resulting gases are passed over catalysts, causing reactions that separate oxygen from carbon molecules, making the carbon molecules high in energy content, similar to gasoline molecules.\
\
The conversion process was created in the lab of Rakesh Agrawal, Purdue's Winthrop E. Stone Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering. He said H2Bioil has significant advantages over traditional standalone methods used to create fuels from biomass.\
\
"The process is quite fast and converts entire biomass to liquid fuel," Agrawal said. "As a result, the yields are substantially higher. Once the process is fully developed, due to the use of external hydrogen, the yield is expected to be two to three times that of the current competing technologies."\
\
The economic analysis, published in the June issue of Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery, shows that the energy source used to create hydrogen for the process makes all the difference when determining whether the biofuel is cost-effective. Hydrogen processed using natural gas or coal makes the H2Bioil cost-effective when crude oil is just over $100 per barrel. But hydrogen derived from other, more expensive, energy sources - nuclear, wind or solar - drive up the break-even point.\
\
"We're in the ballpark," said Wally Tyner, Purdue's James and Lois Ackerman Professor of Agricultural Economics. "In the past, I have said that for biofuels to be competitive, crude prices would need to be at about $120 per barrel. This process looks like it could be competitive when crude is even a little cheaper than that."\
\
Agrawal said he and colleagues Fabio Ribeiro, a Purdue professor of chemical engineering, and Nick Delgass, Purdue's Maxine Spencer Nichols Professor of Chemical Engineering, are working to develop catalysts needed for the H2Bioil conversion processes. The method's initial implementation has worked on a laboratory scale and is being refined so it would become effective on a commercial scale.\
\
"This economic analysis shows us that the process is viable on a commercial scale," Agrawal said. "We can now go back to the lab and focus on refining and improving the process with confidence."\
\
The model Tyner used assumed that corn stover, switchgrass and miscanthus would be the primary feedstocks. The analysis also found that if a federal carbon tax were introduced, driving up the cost of coal and natural gas, more expensive methods for producing hydrogen would become competitive.\
\
"If we had a carbon tax in the future, the break-even prices would be competitive even for nuclear," Tyner said. "Wind and solar, not yet, but maybe down the road."\
\
The U.S. Department of Energy and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research funded the research. Agrawal and his collaborators received a U.S. patent for the conversion process.\

\
Economic Analysis of Novel Synergistic Biofuel (H2Bioil) Processes\
\
Navneet R. Singh, Dharik S. Mallapragada, Rakesh Agrawal, Wallace E. Tyner\
\
Fast-pyrolysis based processes can be built on small-scale and have higher process carbon and energy efficiency as compared to other options. H2Bioil is a novel process based on biomass fast-hydropyrolysis and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and can potentially provide high yields of high energy density liquid fuel at relatively low hydrogen consumption. This paper contains a comprehensive financial analysis of the H2Bioil process with hydrogen derived from different sources. Three different carbon tax scenarios are analyzed: no carbon tax, $55/metric ton carbon tax and $110/metric ton carbon tax. The break-even crude oil price for a delivered biomass cost of $94/metric ton when hydrogen is derived from coal, natural gas or nuclear energy ranges from 103 to 116/bbl for no carbon tax and even lower ($99\'96$111/bbl) for the carbon tax scenarios. This break-even crude oil price compares favorably with the literature estimated prices of fuels from alternate biochemical and thermochemical routes. The impact of the chosen carbon tax is found to be limited relative to the impact of the H2 source on the H2Bioil break-even price. The economic robustness of the processes for hydrogen derived from coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy is seen by an estimated break-even crude oil price of $114\'96126/bbl when biomass cost is increased to $121/metric ton.\

DeBoer: Farmland property taxes to continue rising into 2015\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Farmland owners are in for more property tax increases at least into 2015, Purdue Extension agricultural economist Larry DeBoer says.\
\
In the Jan. 27 issue of his column "Capital Comments," DeBoer said the base rate for the assessment of an acre of farmland will jump from $1,290 in 2011 to $1,500 in 2012. He estimates the base rate will be about $2,030 per acre by 2015. The 2007 base rate was $880.\
\
Indiana farmland is assessed based on its use value rather than its market value - a practice not uncommon among other states. For example, farmland that borders commercial or residential development is not assessed based on selling price but rather only on the income it can earn from farming, DeBoer said.\
\
When determining property taxes, the government uses a formula that takes into account the base rate, productivity factor and influence factor.\
\
The productivity factor is based on soil productivity for growing corn. Subtracted from that for some acreage is an influence factor, which is a percentage reduction in the dollar amount based on conditions such as frequent flooding, grade or forest cover.\
\
Changes in the assessed value come into play because of the way the base rate is calculated each year. Indiana's assessed values change each year based on several factors, including land rents, commodity prices, costs and interest rates. Increasing land rents, high commodity prices and low interest rates have combined to create a trend of increase.\
\
"The base rate is a six-year rolling average," DeBoer said.\
\
That means the base rate for 2011 was based on figures from the years 2002-07. The base rate for 2012 was calculated from the years 2003-08.\
\
Because corn and soybean prices in 2002 were relatively low and interest rates were high, those numbers combined to help keep the average lower in 2011's assessments. Now the numbers from 2002 have been replaced with the high commodity prices and lower interest rates of 2008, resulting in an increase in assessed value.\
\
\'a0"Here's where a new quirk in the formula comes in. The Department of Local Government Finance drops the highest value of the six from the average," DeBoer said. "The General Assembly changed the formula for 2011 taxes to make the increases in the base rate a little smaller."\
\
For 2011 taxes, lawmakers dropped the highest value derived from the 2007 data. But because the 2008 data is higher, it will be dropped, leaving the still-high values of 2007 to factor into the 2012 tax assessments.\
\
"Without dropping the highest value, the base rate for 2012 taxes would have been $1,670," DeBoer said. "The calculation change reduced the base rate by about 10 percent."\
\
Because there is a four-year lag in the formula and all of the data from 2009 and 2010 and most from 2011 are available, DeBoer said it is possible to project what will happen to the base rate for the next few years.\
\
The Department of Local Government Finance used data from 2004-2009 for the 2013 calculation of $1,630, DeBoer said. Because commodity prices have remained high and interest rates low, the base rate for taxes in 2014 will be about $1,760. For taxes in 2015, it will be about $2,030.\
\
The six-year average and four-year lag also mean the high commodity prices and low interest rates in 2012 will first enter the tax formula in 2016 and will not drop out until 2022.\'a0 "The base rate is likely to increase and remain high for a long, long time," DeBoer said.\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A two-year study of high schoolfootball players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits overtime and not from a single blow to the head, as commonly believed.\
Purdue University researchers have studied footballplayers for two seasons at Jefferson High School in Lafayette, Ind., where 21players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season,including 16 repeating players.\
\
Helmet-sensor impact data from each player were comparedwith brain-imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before, during and aftereach season.\
\
"The most important implication of the new findingsis the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow,but it's really the totality of blows that took place over the season,"said Eric Nauman, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and anexpert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma. "The one hitthat brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel'sback."\
\
Researchers evaluated players using a type of brainimaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, alongwith a computer-based neurocognitive screening test. The fMRI scans revealwhich parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks.\
\
Thomas Talavage, an expert in functional neuroimaging andco-director of the Purdue MRI Facility, said the scans indicate players areadapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes.\

\
"The changes in brain activity we are observingsuggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task,and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced," Talavage said."The level of change in the fMRI signal is significantly correlated to thenumber and distribution of hits that a player takes. Performance doesn'tchange, but brain activity changes, showing that certain areas are no longerbeing recruited to perform a task."\
\
Findings, detailed in a paper to appear online in the Journal of Biomechanics, are contrary toconventional thinking.\
\
"Most clinicians would say that if you don't have anyconcussion symptoms you have no problems," said Larry Leverenz, an expertin athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology."However, we are finding that there is actually a lot of change, even whenyou don't have symptoms."\
\
The paper was written by mechanical engineering graduatestudent Evan Breedlove, Nauman, Leverenz, Talavage, former Purdue professor ofeducational studies Jeffrey Gilger, biomedical engineering graduate studentMeghan Robinson, health and kinesiology graduate student Katherine E. Morigaki,electrical and computer engineering graduate student Umit Yoruk, mechanicalengineering undergraduate student Kyle O'Keefe, and undergraduate student inelectrical and computer engineering Jeffrey King. Gilger is now a researcher atthe University of California, Merced.\
\
The research may help to determine how many blows it takesto cause impairment, which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting thenumber of hits a player receives per week.\
\
"Any change in fMRI data is a concern, but we don'tyet know what these changes mean, what they translate to, in terms of cognitiveimpairment," Breedlove said.\
\
A common assumption in sports medicine is that certainpeople are innately more susceptible to head injury. However, the new findingssuggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the mostimportant factor, Talavage said.\
\
"Over the two seasons we had six concussed players,but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not haveconcussions," Talavage said. "There is good correlation with thenumber of hits players received, but we need more subjects."\
\
The researchers have expanded the study to include anadditional high school football team and girls' soccer.\
\
"We want to increase the number of football playersin the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don't wear headprotection," Nauman said. "We also want to include girls to seewhether they are affected differently than boys."\
\
The research findings represent a dilemma because theysuggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose.\
\
"This might be especially important in young peoplebecause the brain is still developing, so even though subtle unexpressed damagedoesn't manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life,"Gilger said.\
\
Changes were seen in regions of the brain that have beenassociated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressivedegenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and otherforms of head injury.\
\
"This is still circumstantial evidence, but itsuggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as aresult of all these hits, and the regions most affected are the ones thatexhibit CTE," Nauman said.\
\
Players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1,900hits to the head in a single season, with two players exceeding 1,800 hits.Helmet-sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 Gs tomore than 100 Gs.\
\
"The worst hit we've seen was almost 300 Gs,"Nauman said.\
\
A soccer player "heading" a ball experiences animpact of about 20 Gs.\
\
Findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive andaccurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions; moreaccurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from headimpacts; determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a singleimpact or repeated impacts; and develop new interventions to reduce the riskand effects of head impacts.\
\
"Now that we know there is definitely a buildup ofdamage before the concussion occurs, ultimately, there is hope that we can domore to prevent concussions," Nauman said.\
\
The work is ongoing and supported with grants from theIndiana State Department of Health's Spinal Cord and Brain Injury ResearchFund, General Electric Healthcare, the Indiana Clinical and TranslationalSciences Institute, and through the National Science Foundation and NationalDefense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowships.\
\
Researchers also will follow the case studies of playerswho take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes inbrain structure using MRI scans.\
\
The research group, called the Purdue Neurotrauma Group(PNG), also is studying ways to reduce traumatic brain injury in soldiers whosuffer concussions caused by shock waves from explosions.\

Concussion is growing public health issue in the United States, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is the chief long-term concern linked to repeated concussions. Recently, attention has shifted toward subconcussive blows and the role they may play in the development of CTE. We assembled a cohort of high school football players for two seasons of observation. Accelerations sensors were placed in the helmets, and all contact activity was monitored. Pre-season computer-based neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests were also obtained in order to assess cognitive and physiological health. In-season follow-up scans were then obtained both from individuals who had sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion and those who had not. These changes were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan. In addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion, a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes. Stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the biomechanical histories of subjects and the ensuing neurophysiological change, suggesting that distinct injury processes are at play. Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that the effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative and that repeated exposure to subconcussive blows is connected to pathologically altered neurophysiology.\

Rap music powers rhythmic action of medical sensor\
\
This graphic illustrates the principles behind the operation of a new type of miniature medical sensor powered by acoustic waves, including those found in music such as rap, blues, jazz and rock. The device, a pressure sensor, might ultimately help to treat people stricken with aneurisms or incontinence due to paralysis. (Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University)\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 The driving bass rhythm of rap music can be harnessed to power a new type of miniature medical sensor designed to be implanted in the body.\
\
Acoustic waves from music, particularly rap, were found to effectively recharge the pressure sensor. Such a device might ultimately help to treat people stricken with aneurisms or incontinence due to paralysis.\
\
The heart of the sensor is a vibrating cantilever, a thin beam attached at one end like a miniature diving board. Music within a certain range of frequencies, from 200-500 hertz, causes the cantilever to vibrate, generating electricity and storing a charge in a capacitor, said Babak Ziaie, a Purdue University professor of electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering.\
\
"The music reaches the correct frequency only at certain times, for example, when there is a strong bass component," he said. "The acoustic energy from the music can pass through body tissue, causing the cantilever to vibrate."\
\
When the frequency falls outside of the proper range, the cantilever stops vibrating, automatically sending the electrical charge to the sensor, which takes a pressure reading and transmits data as radio signals. Because the frequency is continually changing according to the rhythm of a musical composition, the sensor can be induced to repeatedly alternate intervals of storing charge and transmitting data.\
\
"You would only need to do this for a couple of minutes every hour or so to monitor either blood pressure or pressure of urine in the bladder," Ziaie said. "It doesn't take long to do the measurement."\
\
Findings are detailed in a paper to be presented during the IEEE MEMS conference, which will be Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 in Paris. The paper was written by doctoral student Albert Kim, research scientist Teimour Maleki and Ziaie.\
\

\
"This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the concept," he said.\
\
The device is an example of a microelectromechanical system, or MEMS, and was created in the Birck Nanotechnology Center at the university's Discovery Park. The cantilever beam is made from a ceramic material called lead zirconate titanate, or PZT, which is piezoelectric, meaning it generates electricity when compressed. The sensor is about 2 centimeters long. Researchers tested the device in a water-filled balloon.\
\
A receiver that picks up the data from the sensor could be placed several inches from the patient. Playing tones within a certain frequency range also can be used instead of music.\
\
"But a plain tone is a very annoying sound," Ziaie said. "We thought it would be novel and also more aesthetically pleasing to use music."\
\
Researchers experimented with four types of music: rap, blues, jazz and rock.\
\
"Rap is the best because it contains a lot of low frequency sound, notably the bass," Ziaie said.\
\
The sensor is capable of monitoring pressure in the urinary bladder and in the sack of a blood vessel damaged by an aneurism. Such a technology could be used in a system for treating incontinence in people with paralysis by checking bladder pressure and stimulating the spinal cord to close the sphincter that controls urine flow from the bladder. More immediately, it could be used to diagnose incontinence. The conventional diagnostic method now is to insert a probe with a catheter, which must be in place for several hours while the patient remains at the hospital.\
\
"A wireless implantable device could be inserted and left in place, allowing the patient to go home while the pressure is monitored," Ziaie said.\
\
The new technology offers potential benefits over conventional implantable devices, which either use batteries or receive power through a property called inductance, which uses coils on the device and an external transmitter. Both approaches have downsides. Batteries have to be replaced periodically, and data are difficult to retrieve from devices that use inductance; coils on the implanted device and an external receiver must be lined up precisely, and they can only be about a centimeter apart.\
\
A patent application has been filed for the design.\'a0 \

ABSTRACT\
\
A Novel Electromechanical Interrogation Scheme for Implantable Passive Transponders\
\
A. Kim, T. Maleki, and B. Ziaie\'a0 \
\
This paper presents design, fabrication and implementation of a novel electromechanical energy scavenging and wireless interrogation scheme using low-frequency components of musical vibrations to overcome challenges associated with previously reported passive transponders such as: short transmission range, misalignment sensitivity and complicated receiver circuitry. The transponder has two phases of operation: 1) mechanical vibration phase, in which an acoustic receiver (a piezoelectric cantilever) converts the sound vibration into electrical power and charges a capacitor; and 2) electrical radiation phase, in which the stored charge is dumped into an LC tank, forcing it to oscillate at its natural resonance frequency and emitting the energy to an outside receiver. In a pressure-sensing configuration, the distance between a planar coil and a ferrite core is modulated by the pressure, thus changing the inductance and, in turn, inducing a change in the frequency of the emitted signal. A prototype transponder was built and tested using a PZT cantilever with a mechanical resonant frequency of 435 Hz encapsulated in a glass capsule (length=40 mm, diameter=8 mm) along with a rectifier circuitry and a storage capacitor. The inductive pressure sensor located outside the capsule had a sensitivity of 2.5k Hz/kPa. We were able to easily pick up the transmitted RF pulses at distances of up to 7 cm without the tight requirement on alignment between the receiver and the transponder coils.\

\'95 Student honors:\
\
- Purdue's Phi Kappa PsiFraternity is one of 10 college undergraduate organizations to receive a grantfrom the Responsible Scholars Alternative Spring Break Grants program. PhiKappa Psi received $1,000 to travel to San Pedro, Belize, and install solarpanels on an elementary school. The group also will work on variousconstruction projects around the school. The grant program annually awardsorganizations that engage in community work over their spring break vacations.\'a0 Purdue's spring break is the week ofMarch 12. Last spring break, members of Phi Kappa Psi traveled to San Pedro andconstructed an eco-pond system for the local elementary school. The eco-pondfilters and recycles toilet water, saving the community $6,000 in annualmunicipal water fees. The group also helped teach classes, and tutored andmentored students.\

Purdue expert says Super Bowl ads may not be worth the money\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'97 NBC has reported that it sold out advertising time for this year's Super Bowl broadcast before the end of last year. And 30-second spots sold for a record $3.5 million.\
\
Despite the demand, Super Bowl commercials probably aren't worth the premium prices paid to air them, says Richard Feinberg, a consumer psychologist in Purdue University's Department of Consumer Sciences and Retailing.\
\
More than 100 million people are expected to watch the Feb. 5 Super Bowl matchup between the New England Patriots and New York Giants, which will be played at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. When they aren't watching football, fans will be entertained by commercials for everything from beer to clothing to cars. This year, more ads than normal are expected to be longer than the traditional 30 seconds.\
\
The problem, Feinberg says, is that repetition is the key to sales, and, beyond the Super Bowl, some of the commercials don't get much on-air play to the specific consumer groups who buy the products and services advertised.\
\
"Since repetition to the right consumer is the foundation of purchases, companies just might be better off with 10 $350,000 commercials targeted to specific consumers than one $3.5 million commercial targeted to a lot of consumers, but not necessarily the right ones," he says.\
\
Research suggests that many viewers like the ads as much or more than the game itself, Feinberg says. While the extra attention further enhances the effect of a 30-second commercial, liking an ad doesn't necessarily lead to sales.\
\
A study by Feinberg suggests that even if people watch the commercials, they have a limited impact on longer-term memory. And if consumers cannot remember the companies or the products, the commercials do not lead to sales.\
\
He asked 100 consumers who watched the 2010 Super Bowl to recall details from as many commercials as they could. About 30 percent could accurately recall at least one company with a commercial, but respondents had low confidence in their memory, indicating that they "thought" that the company had a commercial. Few could accurately recall details of the commercials.\
\
Feinberg says the most effective Super Bowl commercials are connected to a range of social media, other advertisements and promotions. The use of animals, humor, special effects and celebrities increase memorability, but that alone does not mean an increase in sales, he says.\
\
"The best commercials tap into helping consumers solve a problem, fill a need, make them look better, feel better or be better. The problem with Super Bowl commercials is that there is so much effort to be creative and cute that the real reason why commercials work is lost and ignored," Feinberg says.\
\
"Super Bowl commercials are celebrated for their creativity and humor, but that doesn't guarantee that consumers will become more aware of a product or make a purchase more likely than if the money had been spent in a less expensive but more effective way."\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue Convocations' 2012-13 season will feature 21 performances, including an array of Broadway musicals, plays and concerts.\
\
Highlights of the season include Broadway shows such as Green Day's "American Idiot," "Rock of Ages," and "Shrek the Musical," as well as The Joffrey Ballet and Circus Oz.\
\
The 2012-13 season features a wide range in programming, including blues legend Buddy Guy and a partnership with WBAA in celebration of the NPR station's 90th anniversary presenting "A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor." Convocations also will partner with the Lafayette Symphony presenting the acclaimed piano duo Anderson and Roe, and the National Theatre of Scotland returns with "The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart."\
\
\'a0Todd Wetzel, director of Convocations, has worked for more than a year to bring the National Theatre of Scotland's "Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart" to the community.\
\
"When I was in Scotland for the 2011 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, I couldn't leave without setting in motion the negotiations to bring 'The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart' to Purdue," Wetzel said. "It was the hit of the Festival, so I'm sure this return visit by the National Theatre of Scotland will win you over, too. It's simultaneously uproarious, touching, and unconventionally staged. We'll transform the intimate confines of Duncan Hall into a Scottish pub in which the action surrounds the audience in a magical and compelling fashion."\
\
Friends of Convocations will receive priority seating if their orders are received by June 15. All other orders are then processed as received. For information on becoming a Friend of Convocations, contact Convocations at 765-494-9712.\
\
In addition to scheduled public performances, thousands of students from preschool through high school also will attend a series of matinees and artist-in-residence activities that will be brought to schools during the 2012-13 season. These events are open to all schools, and a complete list can be found at http://www.convocations.org\

Football findings suggest concussions caused by series of hits\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A two-year study of high school football players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head, as commonly believed.\
\
Purdue University researchers have studied football players for two seasons at Jefferson High School in Lafayette, Ind., where 21 players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season, including 16 repeating players.\
\
Helmet-sensor impact data from each player were compared with brain-imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before, during and after each season.\
\
"The most important implication of the new findings is the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow, but it's really the totality of blows that took place over the season," said Eric Nauman, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and an expert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma. "The one hit that brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel's back."\
\
Researchers evaluated players using a type of brain imaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, along with a computer-based neurocognitive screening test. The fMRI scans reveal which parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks.\
\
Thomas Talavage, an expert in functional neuroimaging and co-director of the Purdue MRI Facility, said the scans indicate players are adapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes.\
\
"The changes in brain activity we are observing suggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task, and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced," Talavage said. "The level of change in the fMRI signal is significantly correlated to the number and distribution of hits that a player takes. Performance doesn't change, but brain activity changes, showing that certain areas are no longer being recruited to perform a task."\

\
Findings, detailed in a paper to appear online in the Journal of Biomechanics, are contrary to conventional thinking.\
\
"Most clinicians would say that if you don't have any concussion symptoms you have no problems," said Larry Leverenz, an expert in athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology. "However, we are finding that there is actually a lot of change, even when you don't have symptoms."\
\
The paper was written by mechanical engineering graduate student Evan Breedlove, Nauman, Leverenz, Talavage, former Purdue professor of educational studies Jeffrey Gilger, biomedical engineering graduate student Meghan Robinson, health and kinesiology graduate student Katherine E. Morigaki, electrical and computer engineering graduate student Umit Yoruk, mechanical engineering undergraduate student Kyle O'Keefe, and undergraduate student in electrical and computer engineering Jeffrey King. Gilger is now a researcher at the University of California, Merced.\
\
The research may help to determine how many blows it takes to cause impairment, which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting the number of hits a player receives per week.\
\
"Any change in fMRI data is a concern, but we don't yet know what these changes mean, what they translate to, in terms of cognitive impairment," Breedlove said.\
\
A common assumption in sports medicine is that certain people are innately more susceptible to head injury. However, the new findings suggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the most important factor, Talavage said.\
\
"Over the two seasons we had six concussed players, but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not have concussions," Talavage said. "There is good correlation with the number of hits players received, but we need more subjects."\
\
The researchers have expanded the study to include an additional high school football team and girls' soccer.\
\
"We want to increase the number of football players in the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don't wear head protection," Nauman said. "We also want to include girls to see whether they are affected differently than boys."\
\
The research findings represent a dilemma because they suggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose.\
\
"This might be especially important in young people because the brain is still developing, so even though subtle unexpressed damage doesn't manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life," Gilger said.\
\
Changes were seen in regions of the brain that have been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and other forms of head injury.\
\
"This is still circumstantial evidence, but it suggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as a result of all these hits, and the regions most affected are the ones that exhibit CTE," Nauman said.\
\
Players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1,900 hits to the head in a single season, with two players exceeding 1,800 hits. Helmet-sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 Gs to more than 100 Gs.\
\
"The worst hit we've seen was almost 300 Gs," Nauman said.\
\
A soccer player "heading" a ball experiences an impact of about 20 Gs.\
\
Findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive and accurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions; more accurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from head impacts; determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a single impact or repeated impacts; and develop new interventions to reduce the risk and effects of head impacts.\
\
"Now that we know there is definitely a buildup of damage before the concussion occurs, ultimately, there is hope that we can do more to prevent concussions," Nauman said.\
\
The work is ongoing and supported with grants from the Indiana State Department of Health's Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Fund, General Electric Healthcare, the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, and through the National Science Foundation and National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowships.\
\
Researchers also will follow the case studies of players who take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes in brain structure using MRI scans.\
\
The research group, called the Purdue Neurotrauma Group (PNG), also is studying ways to reduce traumatic brain injury in soldiers who suffer concussions caused by shock waves from explosions.\

\
Concussion is growing public health issue in the United States, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is the chief long-term concern linked to repeated concussions. Recently, attention has shifted toward subconcussive blows and the role they may play in the development of CTE. We assembled a cohort of high school football players for two seasons of observation. Accelerations sensors were placed in the helmets, and all contact activity was monitored. Pre-season computer-based neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests were also obtained in order to assess cognitive and physiological health. In-season follow-up scans were then obtained both from individuals who had sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion and those who had not. These changes were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan. In addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion, a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes. Stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the biomechanical histories of subjects and the ensuing neurophysiological change, suggesting that distinct injury processes are at play. Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that the effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative and that repeated exposure to subconcussive blows is connected to pathologically altered neurophysiology.\

Purdue ag, biological engineering earns top ranking again\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \'96 U.S.News & World Report's ranking of Purdue University's agricultural and biological engineering program as the top graduate specialty in the nation for the fourth consecutive year reflects a commitment to sustained excellence in developing innovators of the future, the program's leader said.\
\
"Our graduate programs have grown significantly over past seven years or so, with current enrollment nearly doubled," said Bernard Engel, head of the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. "The ranking confirms the value of graduate studies in our program. It also speaks to the quality of faculty, staff, students and alumni."\
\
U.S.News & World Report's complete rankings in America's Best Graduate Schools will be available on newsstands April 3. It has published graduate school rankings annually since 1987.\
\
The magazine in September also rated Purdue's agricultural and biological engineering program as the nation's best undergraduate specialty.\
\
Engel noted that the university underscored its commitment to students in both agricultural and biological engineering and agricultural systems management with the opening in January of the $4.2 million ADM Agricultural Innovation Center, which offers greater laboratory and classroom opportunities for students. Archer Daniels Midland Co. was Purdue's primary partner in the center's construction.\'a0\

Innovation promises expanded roles for microsensors\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Researchers have learned how to improve the performance of sensors that use tiny vibrating microcantilevers to detect chemical and biological agents for applications from national security to food processing.\
\
The microcantilevers - slivers of silicon shaped like small diving boards - vibrate at their natural, or "resonant," frequency. Analyzing the frequency change when a particle lands on the microcantilever reveals the particle's presence and potentially its mass and composition.\
\
The sensors are now used to research fundamental scientific questions. However, recent advances may allow for reliable sensing with portable devices, opening up a range of potential applications, said Jeffrey Rhoads, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University.\
\
Creating smaller sensors has been complicated by the fact that measuring the change in frequency does not work as well when the sensors are reduced in size. The researchers showed how to sidestep this obstacle by measuring amplitude, or how far the diving board moves, instead of frequency.\
\
"When you try to shrink these systems, the old way of measuring does not work as well," Rhoads said. "We've made the signal processing part easier, enabling small-scale, lower-power sensors, which are more reliable and have the potential for higher sensitivities."\
\
Findings are detailed in a paper appearing online this week in the Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems. The paper was written by graduate research assistants Vijay Kumar and J. William Boley, undergraduate student Yushi Yang, mechanical engineering professor George Chiu and Rhoads. An earlier paper was published in April in the weekly journal Applied Physics Letters.\
\
The work is based at the Dynamic Analysis of Micro- and Nanosystems Laboratory at Purdue's Birck Nanotechnology Center.\
\
The aim is to apply the new approach to build sensors capable of reliably measuring particles that have a mass of less than one picogram - or trillionth of a gram - at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.\
\
The microcantilever sensors have promise in detecting and measuring constituents such as certain proteins or DNA for biological testing in liquids, gases and the air. The devices might find applications in breath analyzers, industrial and food processing, national security and defense, and food and water quality monitoring.\
\
"One question about these sensors is whether they will continue to work in the field," Rhoads said. "We've been doing a lot of blind, false-positive and false-negative tests to see how they perform in a realistic environment. We've had only a few false positives and negatives in months of testing."\
\
The findings focus on detecting gases and show that the new sensors should be capable of more reliably measuring smaller quantities of gas than is possible with current sensors.\
\
Measuring amplitude is far easier than measuring frequency because the amplitude changes dramatically when a particle lands on the microcantilever, whereas the change in frequency is minute.\
\
"We haven't beaten the sensitivity of all other sensors yet," Rhoads said. "But the difference is that we are trying to do it with a compact device that is truly implementable at the microscale, while many others use fairly large laboratory equipment."\
\
The researchers tested the cantilevers in a chamber filled with precisely controlled quantities of methanol to study their reliability. A patent is pending on the invention.\
\
The research has been partially funded by the National Science Foundation. Student support was provided by Purdue and the Purdue Research Foundation.\

ABSTRACT\
\
Modeling, Analysis, and Experimental Validation of a Bifurcation-Based Microsensor\

\
The potential to detect very small amounts of added mass has driven research in chemical and biological sensors based on resonant micro- and nano-electromechanical systems over the past two decades. While traditional resonant mass sensors utilize chemomechanically induced shifts in linear natural frequency for mass detection, alternate sensing approaches, which exploit the near-resonant nonlinear behavior, have garnered interest from the research community due to their potential to yield improved sensor metrics and simplify final device implementations. This paper investigates the development of an amplitude-based, mass-sensing approach, which utilizes the dynamic transitions that occur near a saddle-node bifurcation in the nonlinear frequency response of a piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever. Specifically, the work details the modeling, analysis and experimental validation of this mass sensing technique. The experimental results presented here not only prove the feasibility of the proposed sensing approach, but also allows for the direct evaluation of pertinent sensor metrics.\

New microtweezers may build tiny 'MEMS' structures\

\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Researchers have created new "microtweezers" capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures, print coatings to make advanced sensors, and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research.\
\
The microtweezers might be used to assemble structures in microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, which contain tiny moving parts. MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes currently are being used in commercial products. A wider variety of MEMS devices, however, could be produced through a manufacturing technology that assembles components like microscopic Lego pieces moved individually into place with microtweezers, said Cagri Savran (pronounced Chary Savran), an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University.\
\
"We've shown how this might be accomplished easily, using new compact and user-friendly microtweezers to assemble polystyrene spheres into three-dimensional shapes," he said.\
\
Research findings were detailed in a paper that appeared online in December in the Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, or JMEMS. The paper was written by Savran, mechanical engineering graduate students Bin-Da Chan and Farrukh Mateen, electrical and computer engineering graduate student Chun-Li Chang, and biomedical engineering doctoral student Kutay Icoz.\

\
The new tool contains three main parts: a thimble knob from a standard micrometer, a two-pronged tweezer made from silicon, and a "graphite interface," which converts the turning motion of the thimble knob into a pulling-and-pushing action to open and close the tweezer prongs. No electrical power sources are needed, increasing the potential for practical applications. Other types of microtweezers have been developed and are being used in research. However, the new design is simpler both to manufacture and operate, Savran said.\
\
The design contains a one-piece "compliant structure," which is springy like a bobby pin or a paperclip. Most other microtweezers require features such as hinges or components that move through heat, magnetism or electricity, complex designs that are expensive to manufacture and relatively difficult to operate in various media, he said.\
\
The tweezers make it feasible to precisely isolate individual stem cell spheres from culture media and to position them elsewhere. Currently, these spheres are analyzed in large groups, but microtweezers could provide an easy way to study them by individually selecting and placing them onto analytical devices and sensors.\
\
"We currently are working to weigh single micro particles, individually selected among many others, which is important because precise measurements of an object's mass reveal key traits, making it possible to identify composition and other characteristics," Savran said. "This will now be as easy as selecting and weighing a single melon out of many melons in a supermarket."\
\
That work is a collaboration with the research group of Timothy Ratliff, the Robert Wallace Miller Director of Purdue's Center for Cancer Research.\
\
The microtweezers also could facilitate the precision printing of chemical or protein dots onto "microcantilevers," strips of silicon that resemble tiny diving boards. The microcantilevers can be "functionalized," or coated with certain chemicals or proteins that attract specific molecules and materials. Because they vibrate at different frequencies depending on what sticks to the surface, they are used to detect chemicals in the air and water.\
\
Generally, microcantilevers are functionalized to detect one type of substance by exposing them to fluids, Savran said. However, being able to microprint a sequence of precisely placed dots of different chemicals on each cantilever could make it possible to functionalize a device to detect several substances at once. Such a sensing technology also would require a smaller sample size than conventional diagnostic technologies, making it especially practical.\
\
The new microtweezers are designed to be attached easily to "translation stages" currently used in research. These stages are essentially platforms on which to mount specimens for viewing and manipulating. Unlike most other microtweezers, the new device is highly compact and portable and can be easily detached from a platform and brought to another lab while still holding a micro-size object for study, Savran said.\
\
The two-pronged tweezer is micromachined in a laboratory called a "clean room" with the same techniques used to create microcircuits and computer chips. The research was based at the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue's Discovery Park.\
\
Purdue has filed for a provisional patent on the design.\

ABSTRACT\
\
A Compact Manually Actuated Micromanipulator \'a0\'a0\
\
Bin-Da Chan, Farrukh Mateen, Chun-Li Chang, Kutay Icoz, and Cagri A. Savran\
\
This letter reports a compact, versatile, and user-friendly micromanipulator that uses an elastically deformable silicon microtweezer to grab microentities and a micrometer head for rotational manual actuation. The micro-/macroconnection is achieved via a graphite interface that results in a compact and portable design and placement on most translation stages. The system, which can operate in both air and liquid and transport objects between the two media, has a wide range of applications. We demonstrate but a few of them, including in situ construction of microstructures in 3-D, isolation and placement of individual microparticles on designated spots on sensors, on-demand microcontact printing of microparticles, and manipulation of live stem cell spheres. [2011-0237] Index Terms - Microgripper, micromanipulator, microstamping, microtweezer.\

Pill some day may prevent serious foodborne illness, scientist says\
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Modified probiotics, the beneficial bacteria touted for their role in digestive health, could one day decrease the risk of Listeria infection in people with susceptible immune systems, according to Purdue University research.\
\
Arun Bhunia, a professor of food science; Mary Anne Amalaradjou, a Purdue postdoctoral researcher; and Ok Kyung Koo, a former Purdue doctoral student, found that the same Listeria protein that allows the bacteria to pass through intestinal cells and into bloodstreams can help block those same paths when added to a probiotic.\
\
"Based on the research, it looks very promising that we would get a significant reduction in Listeria infections," said Bhunia, whose findings were published this month in the journal PLoS One.\
\
Bhunia's earlier work showed that Listeria triggers intestinal cells to express heat shock protein 60 on their surfaces. That allows Listeria to bind to the intestinal cells using an adhesion protein and pass into them, acting as a sort of gateway to the bloodstream.\
\
Once in the bloodstream, even small doses of Listeria can cause fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea, as well as headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions if it spreads to the nervous system. It can also cause abortion and stillbirth in pregnant women.\
\
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it sickens about 1,500 and kills 255 people each year in the United States and primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults and those with weakened immune systems.\
\
"We're seeing fewer Listeria infections, but the severity of those infections is still high," Amalaradjou said.\
\
The researchers found that probiotics alone were ineffective in combatting Listeria, so they stole a trick from the bacteria's own playbook. By adding the Listeria adhesion protein to the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei, they were able to decrease the number of Listeria cells that passed through intestinal cells by 46 percent, a significant decrease in the amount of the bacteria that could infect a susceptible person.\
\
With the adhesion protein, Lactobacillus paracasei interacts with heat shock protein on the surface of intestinal cells just as Listeria would. The probiotic then attached to the intestinal cells, crowding out Listeria.\
\
"It's creating a competition," Bhunia said. "If Listeria comes in, it doesn't find a place to attach or invade."\
\
Bhunia said he could one day foresee the development of a pill or probiotic drink that could be given to at-risk patients to minimize the risk of Listeria infection.\
\
The results came from tests on human intestinal cells. The next step would be animal testing. Bhunia said that would allow him to see whether different doses would have a greater effect.\
\
Bhunia used funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in previous work on Listeria, but the current study was internally funded.\

ABSTRACT\
\
Recombinant Probiotic Expressing Listeria Adhesion Protein Attenuates\
Listeria monocytogenes Virulence In Vitro\
\
Ok Kyung Koo, Mary Anne Amalaradjou, Arun K. Bhunia\
\
Background: Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular foodborne pathogen, infects immunocompromised hosts. The primary route of transmission is through contaminated food. In the gastrointestinal tract, it traverses the epithelial barrier through intracellular or paracellular routes. Strategies to prevent L. monocytogenes entry can potentially minimize infection in high-risk populations. Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) aids L. monocytogenes in crossing epithelial barriers via the paracellular route. The use of recombinant probiotic bacteria expressing LAP would aid targeted clearance of Listeria from the gut and protect high-risk populations from infection.\
\
Methodology/Principal Findings: The objective was to investigate the ability of probiotic bacteria or LAP-expressing recombinant probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei (LbpLAP) to prevent L. monocytogenes adhesion, invasion, and transwell-based transepithelial translocation in a Caco-2 cell culture model. Several wild type probiotic bacteria showed strong adhesion to Caco-2 cells but none effectively prevented L. monocytogenes infection. Pre-exposure to LbpLAP for 1, 4, 15, or 24 h significantly (P<0.05) reduced adhesion, invasion, and transepithelial translocation of L. monocytogenes in Caco-2 cells, whereas pre-exposure to parental Lb. paracasei had no significant effect. Similarly, LbpLAP pre-exposure reduced L. monocytogenes translocation by as much as 46% after 24 h. LbpLAP also prevented L. monocytogenes-mediated cell damage and compromise of tight junction integrity. Furthermore, LbpLAP cells reduced L. monocytogenes-mediated cell cytotoxicity by 99.8% after 1 h and 79% after 24 h.\
\
Conclusions/Significance: Wild type probiotic bacteria were unable to prevent L. monocytogenes infection in vitro. In contrast, LbpLAP blocked adhesion, invasion, and translocation of L. monocytogenes by interacting with host cell receptor Hsp60, thereby protecting cells from infection. These data show promise for the use of recombinant probiotics in preventing L. monocytogenes infection in high-risk populations.\
