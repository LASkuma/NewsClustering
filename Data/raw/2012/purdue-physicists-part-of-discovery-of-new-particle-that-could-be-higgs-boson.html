<p>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. &#8212; Purdue University scientists were part of a 
historical event this 4th of July as scientists working on the biggest 
international experiment in particle physics history announced the 
discovery of a new particle that may be the long-sought Higgs boson.</p>
<p>Purdue's particle physics group has been a part of the more than 
two-decade search for the elusive particle, which could confirm the 
Standard Model of physics and provide insight into how the universe 
formed.</p>
<p>Daniela Bortoletto, the Edward Purcell Distinguished Professor of 
Physics, and Ian Shipsey, the Julian Schwinger Distinguished Professor 
of Physics, attended the announcement at the European Organization for 
Nuclear Research, or CERN, laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. </p>
<p>"On a day where fireworks lit up skies across America, the world of 
science unveiled explosive news concerning the longtime elusive Higgs 
boson particle," said Shipsey, who also is the co-coordinator of the 
Large Hadron Collider Physics Center at Fermilab, near Chicago, and was 
recently elected chair of the Compact Muon Solenoid Collaboration Board 
at CERN. "More data are needed to establish whether this new particle 
has all the properties of the Standard Model Higgs boson or whether some
 do not match, which would imply new physics beyond the Standard Model. 
Either way we've discovered one more key to unlock the mysteries of the 
universe."</p>
<p>The announcement was received with cheers during a joint seminar at CERN and the ICHEP Conference in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>The results came from experiments using the largest machine ever 
built by mankind, the 27 kilometer-long Large Hadron Collider or LHC. 
Superconducting magnets that drive the collider are kept at 1.9 Kelvins,
 colder than outer space, and billions of protons traveling near the 
speed of light collide at the world record energy of 8 trillion electron
 volts. The energy of these collisions transforms into tiny subatomic 
particles, which may never have been seen before and some of which live 
for only one-trillionth-of-one-trillionth of a second.</p>

<p>The Compact Muon Solenoid is one of three detectors at the LHC that 
captures traces of these tiny particles. It is, in essence, a 14,000-ton
 camera the size of a four-story office building that almost completely 
surrounds one section of the collider and takes up to 40 million 
pictures every second. </p>
<p>Purdue scientists and students contributed to the design and 
construction of several key parts of the CMS camera, the software used 
to operate camera and analyze the collisions, and have contributed to a 
variety of key measurements with the data. </p>
<p>Bortoletto and Shipsey led the camera design and assembly teams. 
Purdue physics professors Virgil Barnes and Laszlo Gutay contributed key
 design features to two major components of the detector: the Hadron 
calorimeters, which detect showers of particles coming from high energy 
quarks; and the Muon detectors, which detect heavy relatives of the 
electron. Bortoletto also is the upgrade coordinator of the U.S. CMS and
 is responsible for coordinating the 47 U.S. universities working to 
upgrade the CMS camera. </p>
<p>In addition, Purdue physics professors Matthew Jones, David Miller 
and Norbert Neumeister are part of the international CMS team, and 20 
other Purdue personnel, including&#160;engineers, scientists, post-doctoral 
researchers, graduate students and undergraduates have participated in 
the experiment. </p>
<p>Neumeister, with close collaboration from Purdue's information 
technology group, also is contributing to the global distributed 
computing system that analyzed the data from the experiments. &#160;The 
Purdue CMS "Tier 2" data storage and processing center is the largest 
one of its kind among U.S. universities. </p>
<p>Bortoletto has been involved in several of the analyses searching for
 the Higgs boson, and Neumeister and Shipsey have been involved in the 
internal reviewing process. </p>
<p>Higgs bosons, if they exist, are short-lived and quickly decay into 
other particles. Because scientists cannot look directly for the 
particle, its discovery relies on observations of excess amounts of the 
particles into which it can decay. However, just as making change for a 
one-dollar bill can be done using different combinations of coins, Higgs
 bosons can decay into different combinations of particles. </p>
<p>Bortoletto's group looked for evidence of specific subatomic 
particles that would result from one possible decay of a Higgs boson. </p>

<p>To avoid any possible bias while analyzing new data and ensure 
objectivity when looking for much sought-after signs of new physics, 
physicists draw "blinds" over the region where an excess of decay events
 is expected, Bortoletto said. This region is only "unblinded" when they
 are satisfied enough with their procedures to give confidence in the 
ultimate result. </p>
<p>"The moment the analysis was unblinded was amazing," Bortoletto said.
 "The excess at 125.3 GeV was easy to see, and we felt as though a major
 discovery was appearing in front of us. The statistical significance 
achieved was enough to be classified as a discovery. The probability of 
the background alone fluctuating by this amount is one in three 
million." </p>
<p>CMS reported observations consistent with expectations for the 
Standard Model Higgs boson. The results were found with a statistical 
significance of 4.9 sigma, a unit of standard deviation, which means 
scientists are 99.99997 percent certain of the discovery. </p>
<p>The Standard Model of particle physics describes the basic building 
blocks of matter and their interactions, and its explanations of 
elementary particles and forces have held true through more than four 
decades of experimental testing. The Higgs boson remains the only 
missing piece of the model and, without it the critical component of how
 these particles obtain mass cannot be explained. </p>
<p>"The Standard Model Higgs would tidily complete the Standard Model of
 particles and forces," Barnes said. "However, the very precise and 
successful Standard Model does not explain all that we have observed."</p>
<p>It does not give us guidance on how to unify gravity with the other 
known forces of nature, explain why there are exactly three pairs of 
quarks and three generations of leptons or explain why the third 
generations are some ten-thousand times heavier than the first 
generations, he said.</p>
<p>"There are some very appealing theories involving a whole host of new
 particles, some of which we are really hoping to find at the LHC," 
Barnes said. "It is not impossible that our new particle could be, for 
example, one of the postulated supersymmetric Higgses."&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is named after Peter Higgs, a professor of physics at
 the University of Edinburgh, who first suggested the particle as the 
mechanism that gives mass to matter. </p>
<p>Shipsey was a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh and 
attended classes taught by Higgs. This announcement was the first time 
Shipsey had seen Higgs in 20 years.</p>
<p>"Peter was a brilliant teacher and all the students were in awe of 
him," Shipsey said. "However, he is an extremely modest person and is 
somewhat embarrassed that the particle carries his name. It was 
wonderful to see him again and share this moment with him."</p>
<p>The LHC continues to deliver new data at an impressive rate. By the 
end of 2012, CMS hopes to have more than triple its total current data 
sample. These data will enable CMS to further elucidate the nature of 
this newly observed particle. They will also allow CMS to extend the 
reach of their many other searches for new physics, Bortoletto said.</p>
