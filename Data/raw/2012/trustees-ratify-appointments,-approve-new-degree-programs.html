<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Varma is the R. Games Slayter Distinguished Professor and
head of the School of Chemical Engineering and came to Purdue in 2004. Before
that he was on the faculty at the University of Notre Dame, beginning in 1975,
serving as chair from 1982-1988 and as the inaugural Arthur J. Schmitt
Professor from 1988-2003. He was founder and director of the Center for
Molecularly Engineered Materials at Notre Dame. He also has worked as a senior
research engineer for Union Carbide Corp.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">A fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers,
the American Institute of Chemists and the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, he has co-authored three books and is founding editor
of the Cambridge University Press series in chemical engineering. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Varma's research interests are in chemical and catalytic
reaction engineering, new energy sources and synthesis of advanced materials.
He has written more than 265 archival journal research publications in these
areas.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">He earned his bachelor's degree from Panjab University,
India, his master's degree from the University of New Brunswick, Canada, and
his doctorate from the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">In other business, trustees approved a bachelor's degree
program in environmental and ecological engineering for the West Lafayette
campus, a bachelor's degree program in technical communication at Indiana
University-Purdue University Indianapolis and a bachelor's degree program in
applied computer science at IUPUI.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">No new state funding is being requested for any of the
programs and no additional learning resources are necessary. All three programs
are scheduled to begin this fall and require approval from the Indiana
Commission for Higher Education.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The goal of the environmental and ecological engineering
program is to prepare graduates for employment in those fields or to continue
education in an advanced degree program or a related field, Lechtenberg said.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"A distinguishing feature of the program is the
interdisciplinary approach and the contributions from faculty across several
disciplines of engineering," Lechtenberg said. "Complex modern
environmental problems cannot be solved by traditional environmental
engineering alone, and require contributions, change in design practices and
altered problem-solving approaches across engineering disciplines."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Lechtenberg said the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
predicts employment in environmental engineering will grow much faster than
average, with the addition of almost 17,000 jobs by 2018. Growth in employment
in the field in Indiana is expected to be equivalent or better than national
projections, he said.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The technical communication degree is designed to prepare
graduates for entry-level technical communications work or graduate work in
technical communication or related fields. It also is geared toward students
who want a double major, pursue work in a technical field relevant to technical
communication, and people in mid-career who want to upgrade their skills.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Technical communication is a growing, dynamic field as
technology becomes more complex and specialized, Lechtenberg said.</p>

program. </p>

growing sectors of the economy in Indiana and the nation. In 2008 and 2010, the
Indiana Department of Workforce Development listed computer software engineer
as the top job on the "Hot 50 Hoosier Job" list, he said. Two other
IT industry positions requiring a bachelor's degree also were on the list.</p>
