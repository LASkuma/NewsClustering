<p>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Experts agree that
discovering the secrets to successful aging will demand a sustained effort
using innovative scientific approaches. Now a research veterinarian is betting
that the oldest pet dogs living among us can shed light on a surer scientific
path to discovering the secrets of successful aging and cancer resistance.</p>
<p>This week marks the launch of The Old Grey
Muzzle Tour 2013, a cross-country scientific expedition by David J. Waters,
DVM, to study 12 of the oldest-living Rottweilers in their homes. The trek
begins in Homer, Alaska, on Monday (March 4) and will finish April 12 in West
Lafayette, Ind.</p>
<p>The 40-day itinerary of The Old Grey Muzzle Tour
2013 includes 12 scientific stops to visit dogs and 11 additional stops, which
include two academic lectures and nine celebration events where Waters will
meet with groups inspired by his research.</p>
<p>The tour's complete itinerary is as follows:
March 4, Homer, Alaska; March 6, Anderson Island, Wash.; March 7, Amboy, Wash.;
March 10, Claremont, N.H.; March 11, Staten Island, N.Y.; March 12,
Wyckoff,&#160; N.J.; March 13, Madison, Va.;
March 14, Richmond, Va.; March 15, Atlanta; March 16, Louisville, Ky.; March
19, Lexington, Ky.; March 21, Parke County, Ind.; March 23, Ypsilanti, Mich.;
March 26, Lomira, Wis.; March 28, Tulsa, Okla.; March 30, Tijeras, N.M.; March
31 and April 1, Albuquerque, N.M.; April 3, Fort Collins, Colo.; April 6, San
Diego; April 7, Aguanga, Calif.; April 9, Pray, Mont.; April 12, West
Lafayette, Ind.</p>
<p>Waters is director of the Center for Exceptional
Longevity Studies at the Gerald P. Murphy Cancer Foundation, based at the
Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette. The Center for Exceptional Longevity
Studies is home to the Exceptional Longevity Database, the first systematic
study of highly successful aging in pet dogs in which Waters' research team has
catalogued the lifetime health and medical histories of almost 250 canine "centenarians"
- Rottweilers that have lived at least 13 years, which is more than 30 percent
longer than breed average and equivalent to humans reaching 100.</p>
<p>"A notable aspect of highly successful
aging is the delay or avoidance of diseases such as cancer," Waters said. "The
exceptionally long-lived Rottweilers we are studying have figured out how to
side-step cancer, hold it in check. Our autopsy studies have shown that,
although few of these dogs die of cancer, more than 90 percent of them are
harboring one or more types of cancer at the time of death."</p>
<p>Through dedicated research - the detailed
examination of tissues and careful identification of markers circulating in the
blood - Waters and his team hope to discover how they do it, so pets and people
can walk around with cancer as a nuisance instead of a lethal killer.</p>
<p>"That's why we have established the
Longevity Biorepository at the Center for Exceptional Longevity Studies - the
world's first collection of serum, blood cells, DNA and autopsy tissues from
exceptionally long-lived dogs," he said. "Securing biospecimens from
the 12 dogs I visit will expand the array of specimens on hand, thereby
accelerating our progress."</p>
<p>Waters' research on older Rottweilers is already
opening avenues of inquiry on the aging-cancer connection and evaluating the
impact of early life choices and interventions on healthy longevity, providing
a clearer picture of how factors such as response to stress, ovaries, and
obesity, impact healthy aging. Waters gained these new insights by changing the
way aging research is conducted.</p>
<p>"In 2010, our research on aging and healthy
longevity broke out of the ivory tower and headed into the living room,
capitalizing on the opportunity to study first-hand some of the oldest-living
dogs in their homes," said Waters, who is associate director of Purdue's
Center on Aging and the Life Course and professor in the Department of
Veterinary Clinical Sciences.</p>
<p>Waters' Old Grey Muzzle Tour in spring 2010
captured national media attention and fueled his passion for further pursuing
this novel research approach.</p>
<p>"By visiting dogs in their homes, we
committed ourselves to an essential tenet of discovery: There's no substitute
for first-hand observations," he said. "Whether you are trying to
understand how children learn or what it takes to age successfully, first-hand
observations are critical."</p>
<p>During each dog visit, Waters will perform
detailed physical and neurological exams, collect DNA samples, and record body
measurements. He will also conduct extensive interviews with owners, exploring
the living environment and learning the things that owners have done to promote
their pet's exceptional health.</p>
<p>"At each stop, I'm searching for a special
kind of information, finding the difference that will make a difference in how
we and others think about the aging process," he said. "I'm trying to
spot the connections that will put us on a surer path to discovery."</p>
<p>After the home visit, urine and blood are
collected regularly by the dog's veterinarian and sent to the Center for
Exceptional Longevity Studies for analysis and specimen banking. The
researchers also follow-up regularly with owners regarding the dog's activity
level, pain and cognition. </p>
<p>Waters sees The Old Grey Muzzle Tour 2013 as a
key element in building research momentum needed to accelerate discovery. In
this 150th anniversary of the veterinary profession, The Old Grey Muzzle Tour
serves as an exemplar of the American Veterinary Medical Association's One
Health initiative, championing the kinds of research intended to benefit the
health of animals and humans.</p>
<p>Waters, 54, will have his stamina tested by the
intensive journey, but he is quick to divert attention to the true heroes of
the Tour.</p>
<p>"The real heroes of this expedition are
those exceptionally long-lived, cancer-resistant Rottweilers who are furthering
a pet-person partnership to beat cancer and uncover the secrets of successful
aging," he said. "After my visit is over, I remember each one of them
as my teacher."</p>
<p>In addition to the scientific goals, Waters
hopes to increase public awareness for the need for this brand of "connecting"
research.</p>
<p>"We have a real opportunity here," he
said. "Dogs with extreme longevity - equivalent to humans who reach 100
years - may hold the keys to unlock the mechanisms that connect cancer
resistance and successful aging."</p>
<p>Since 1999, Waters' research team at the Center
for Exceptional Longevity Studies has worked to expand the aging research
toolkit by studying aging in pet dogs as a model for understanding healthy
human longevity. The potential to gain from this research approach, along with
the Center's progress, was summarized by Waters in a scientific paper
commissioned by The National Academies of Sciences titled "Aging Research
2011: Exploring the Pet Dog Paradigm" (ILAR Journal, 2011).</p>
<p>David G. Bostwick, MD, MBA, chief scientific officer
of AIBioTech, which is sponsoring the celebration stop March 14 in Richmond,
Va., described Waters' work in the context of research done by other investigators
at the intersection of aging and cancer.</p>
<p>"Dr. Waters' work with the oldest-old pet
dogs is educating us, challenging the way we think about aging," Bostwick
said. "The biogerontology field certainly needs new workhorses to generate
and test new hypotheses. I'm wagering those grey muzzles that he's studying
in-depth will have some intriguing stories to tell us about how we can age more
successfully."</p>
<p>As Waters prepares to embark on his journey, he
reflected on the wisdom of the world-renowned physicist Freeman Dyson.</p>
<p>"Professor Dyson taught us that science
flourishes best when it uses freely all the tools at hand, unconstrained by
preconceived notions of what science ought to be," Waters said. "We
see pet dogs as powerful tools to deepen our understanding of the aging
process. New tools mean new hope: hope that the new research can lead to
longer, healthier lives."</p>

<p><b>About The Center for
Exceptional Longevity Studies</b></p>
<p>The Center for Exceptional Longevity Studies of
the Gerald P. Murphy Cancer Foundation seeks to identify important genetic and
environmental determinants of healthy longevity and to better understand the
complex relationship between aging and cancer. While the scientific community
looks for reliable research approaches to verify exciting scientific leads, we
see enormous value in studying pet dogs living with their owners as a natural
aging laboratory. There is a big payoff for validating this kind of innovative
thinking - an opportunity to promote healthy longevity in both pets and people.
The Center and its research are supported by P&amp;G Pet Care, makers of Iams
and Eukanuba, and the Rottweiler Health Foundation. The research is conducted
jointly by the Murphy Cancer Foundation and Purdue University. The Murphy
Foundation is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit research institute.</p>
