<p><b><i>Research to conclude with shake
table testing</i></b><b><i>&#160;</i></b></p>
<p>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A partnership of leading
earthquake engineering researchers from top U.S. and Canadian universities and
design professionals from the steel industry have begun the final phase of a
three-year project to increase the seismic safety of buildings that use
lightweight cold-formed steel for their primary beams and columns.&#160;</p>
<p>Funded by a grant from the George E. Brown, Jr.
Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Network (NEES), the researchers
have already developed a series of computational models to determine how a
complete building structure will perform during an earthquake.&#160;</p>
<p>Headquartered at Purdue's <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/">Discovery Park</a>,
NEES is a collaborative, 14-site research initiative that aims to improve
structural seismic design and reduce the damaging effects of earthquakes and
tsunamis. NEES is funded by a $105 million <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a>&#160;grant. NEEScomm is the operations unit at Purdue.&#160;</p>
<p>The initial stage in the testing involved the
construction of a two-story structure and then testing on a "shake
table" at the University of Buffalo. The building will undergo the rigors
of a controlled earthquake to determine how it performs. There will be two
phases to the shake table testing: Phase One is taking place June 12-14 and
will test only the structural components, which include the cold-formed steel
skeleton and the OSB (oriented strand board) sheathing for the floor diaphragm
and roof; Phase Two will add non-structural components like stairs, gypsum
sheathing and interior partitions. The objective is to advance cold-formed
steel light-frame design in buildings to the next level and equip engineers to
implement these performance-based seismic designs in their projects.&#160;</p>
<p>The data from the research is published on
<a href="http://nees.org/">NEEShub</a>, the cyberinfrastructure component of the NEES
network. The NEEShub platform is powered by Purdue's HUBzero software.&#160;</p>
<p>The research team is led by Benjamin Schafer of
the Department of Civil Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and a longtime
member of two standards-developing committees of the American Iron and Steel
Institute (AISI) - the Committee on Specifications and the Committee on Framing
Standards. Schafer's team includes additional researchers from Johns Hopkins
and Bucknell University, with input from colleagues at the University of North
Texas, Virginia Tech and McGill University in Montreal, Canada.&#160;</p>
<p>Several steel industry partners are participating
in the project, providing technical expertise, donated materials and additional
funding. The steel industry partners include the American Iron and Steel
Institute, Bentley Systems Inc., ClarkDietrich Building Systems, Devco
Engineering Inc., DSi Engineering, Mader Construction Co. Inc., Simpson
Strong-Tie Co. Inc., the Steel Framing Industry Association, and the Steel Stud
Manufacturers Association.&#160;</p>
<p>"We appreciate the valuable technical and
economic input that our industry partners have provided," said Schafer,
the project's principal investigator.&#160;</p>
<p>"This project has already resulted in several
innovations that will immediately impact seismic cold-formed steel design
standards, making buildings safer," Schafer said. "Now comes the fun
part - getting to see how all the research plays out on the shake table. One of
the important deliverables from this project will be the transfer of our
research results into an open-source software framework. The data will then be
made available to engineers, allowing them to see how their structural system
designs will respond to an earthquake before they are constructed. This
software will create cost efficiencies and potentially save lives."</p>
<p>In fact, project data is already on NEEShub.
Preliminary testing conducted on building components (shear walls in
particular) have been posted for engineers to examine. Initial uploading of the
test data happens immediately after the tests. Fully curated data will happen
over the course of this summer.&#160;</p>
<p>Schafer said Johns Hopkins graduate student Kara
Peterman is on site at the University of Buffalo Structural Engineering and
Earthquake Simulation Laboratory (SEESL) and is providing updates on the
structure's construction and blog entries at the <a href="http://cfsnees.blogspot.com/">CFS NEES blog</a>.</p>
<p><b>Project
Background</b></p>
<p>The award is an outcome of the National Science
Foundation 09-524 program solicitation for the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for
Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research competition. The title of the
project is "<a href="http://http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1041578">NEES-CR: Enabling Performance-Based Seismic Design of
Multi-Story Cold-Formed Steel Structures</a>," award number 1041578.&#160;</p>
<p>The analysis and initial testing for the project
began in late 2010 and took place at John Hopkins University and the University
of North Texas. The focus has now moved to the University of Buffalo, where
construction of the two-story test building was recently completed. Full-scale
shake-table testing is expected to take place in the summer.</p>
