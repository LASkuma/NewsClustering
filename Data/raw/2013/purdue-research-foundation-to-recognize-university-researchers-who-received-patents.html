<h2>Purdue Research Foundation to recognize university researchers who received patents</h2>
<div id="video-embed"><videoembed/></div>
<FirstPhoto/>
<p>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Forty-seven Purdue
University faculty and staff whose discoveries were patented during the
2011-2012 fiscal year will be recognized Wednesday (April 3) at the Purdue
Research Foundation's eighth annual Inventors Recognition Reception.</p>
<p>During the fiscal year July 1, 2011, to June 30,
2012, Purdue Research Foundation officials reported 356 invention disclosures,
446 patent applications worldwide, 95 issued patents worldwide and the creation
of five startups from Purdue-licensed technologies.</p>
<p>"Purdue faculty, staff and students strive
to make people's lives healthier, happier or more productive when they develop
new products and processes," said Elizabeth Hart-Wells, assistant vice
president and director of the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization.
"The issuance of patents to protect intellectual property increases the
potential this work will be translated into products and services for the
public. The number of patents issued to Purdue-related discoveries has more
than tripled from 31 in 2007-2008, which is a credit to the innovative faculty,
staff, post-doctorate students and graduate students throughout the university's
