<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Roy has been at Purdue since 1993 when he was appointed
assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. He became associate
professor in 1997, professor in 2001 and the Roscoe H. George Professor of
Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2005.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">His research interests include spintronics, low-power

computing models/architecture enabled by emerging devices. He was the first to
propose the use of power gating (sleep transistor) to reduce leakage, a
technique now widely used in industry. He has been awarded 19 patents and
published more than 200 journal papers, 400 conference papers and two books.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">He has received the Humboldt Research Award for senior
scientists, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Circuits and
Systems Society Technical Achievement Award, Semiconductor research Corporation
Technical Excellence Award, Fulbright-Nehru Distinguished chair, Distinguished
Alumnus Award from Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, the National
Science Foundation Career Development Award, and was a Purdue Faculty Scholar.
He is a fellow of the IEEE.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Roy earned his bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute
of Technology in Kharagpur and his doctorate from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Trustees also approved a bachelor of science in health
studies degree program at Purdue North Central.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"This program is an integral aspect of Purdue North
Central's strategic plan, contributes to economic development in northern
Indiana and meets the needs of employers in this region," said Timothy
Sands, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost and Purdue's
Basil S. Turner Professor of Engineering. "This degree builds upon PNC's
successful baccalaureate in nursing."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">&#160;Sands said nearly
400 students are enrolled as pre-nursing at PNC but most will not be admitted
into nursing. He said they complete the first two years of the program, and
then many leave because there is not a program that meets their needs.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Ten of the 20 fastest-growing occupations are related to
health care, Sands said. Health-care support occupations have a 28.7 percent
projected growth rate through 2018, according to the Indiana Department of
Workforce Development Agency.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">One of the positions that health studies graduates will be
well prepared for, medical services manager, is No. 10 in the top 50 "<a href="https://netsolutions.dwd.in.gov/hh50/jobList.aspx">Hot
Jobs</a>" in Indiana.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The program, which must be approved by the Indiana
Commission for Higher Education, includes an articulation agreement with Ivy
Tech Community College Northwest.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">In other business, trustees approved the request of the
College of Veterinary Medicine to change the name of the associate of science
degree in veterinary technology to associate of applied science in veterinary
technology.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Sands said the degree's new title is what the two-year
degree was called at the time of its inception in 1976. It was changed to the
associate of science degree when the bachelor of science degree program began
in 1997.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Although the majority of students in the program
continue on to the bachelor of science degree, they are all eligible to be
credentialed as registered veterinary technicians in the state of Indiana and
49 of 50 states with the associate level degree," Sands said.&#160;</p>
