Currently, nine schools out of 14 in the Big Ten Conference have separate fundraising foundations. In Indiana, the other large public schools - Indiana University, Ball State, Indiana State and Ivy Tech - have foundations to support development activities.<\/p>\n<p>The decision follows a review by Purdue University and Purdue Research Foundation conducted over the past several months with a goal to enhance the foundation's role as a supporting organization for Purdue. The study found that the move provides:<\/p>\n<p>* An avenue to support long-term sustainability because one organization will now solicit, process and steward all gifts. Currently, gifts such as real estate involve a thorough, time-intensive process through the foundation and the university. The move of fundraising to the foundation will simplify that process.<\/p>\n<p>* Potential efficiencies through administrative synergies and streamlining of processes within the University Development Office and the Office of Investments.<\/p>\n<p>* Positive outcomes that include the consolidation of the development and investment functions to create a singular focus on raising funds and maximizing returns on investments.<\/p>\n<p>The 160-plus people working in the Purdue development and investment offices will be able to transfer their length of service and equivalent benefits to the Purdue Research Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>The move is consistent with other current initiatives of the foundation, which is a private, nonprofit entity created to advance the mission of Purdue. Established in 1930, the foundation accepts gifts, administers trusts, funds scholarships and grants, and acquires property on behalf of Purdue. Services provided by the foundation benefit the university's academic endeavors and support economic development initiatives. The foundation manages the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization, which operates one of the most comprehensive technology transfer programs among leading research universities in the United States. The foundation oversees the Purdue Research Park, which is the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.<\/p>\n<p>In other business, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Board of Trustees, ratified the appointment of Amy Noah as vice president for development. She will continue to serve in that role with the Purdue Research Foundation after the Jan. 1, 2014, transition. Similarly, Scott Seidle will transfer to PRF with the Office of Investments and continue to serve as chief investment officer. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Media contacts:<\/strong> Shelley Triol, Purdue University assistant vice president for external relations, 765-496-2644, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/striol@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">striol@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\nCynthia Sequin, Purdue Research Foundation director of marketing and communications, 765-413-6031, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/casequin@prf.org\" target=\"_blank\">casequin@prf.org<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/7a58b3c896eab6a8c9a34f52e2099f38/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/purdue-university-development,-investment-offices-to-transfer-to-purdue-research-foundation.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

She spent the first 10 years of her development career in the College of Engineering. Beginning in September 2011, she served as associate vice president for advancement in the University Development Office. As associate vice president, she oversaw development efforts in all schools and programs within the colleges of Engineering and Technology as well as Libraries and University Press, Discovery Park, WBAA, University Corporate and Foundation Relations, Planned Giving, and Purdue's West Coast development initiatives. Since becoming interim vice president, she has worked in direct partnership with Daniels to lead university-wide fundraising efforts.<\/p>\n<p>\"I am thrilled to be asked to lead this amazing group of individuals and to continue serving this institution that I believe in so strongly,\" Noah said. \"Our goal, as always, will be to seek the private financial support that will help Purdue achieve success in learning, discovery and engagement.\"<\/p>\n<p>The University Development Office plans, coordinates and implements fundraising programs among alumni, friends, corporations and foundations. Private giving has averaged $235.5 million over the past 12 years and has resulted in many new student scholarship funds, faculty support, facilities and innovative new programs.<\/p>\n<p>Noah's appointment is subject to ratification by Purdue's Board of Trustees. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Contact:<\/strong> Shelley Triol, assistant vice president for external relations, 765-496-2644, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/striol@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">striol@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<strong>Source:<\/strong> Amy Noah, 765-494-0519, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/arnoah@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">arnoah@purdue.edu<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/7a58b3c896eab6a8c9a34f52e2099f38/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/noah-named-vice-president-for-development.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Brian Lamb, founder and executive chairman of C-SPAN and a Purdue alumnus, has been her chief collaborator.<\/p>\n<p>\"The Purdue Institute for Civic Communication will prepare our students to be leaders in their communities and beyond,\" said Purdue President Mitch Daniels. \"It is an excellent addition to their career studies.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Daniels Fund was started by Bill Daniels, a pioneer in cable television. Bill Daniels (no relation to Mitch Daniels) founded his first cable business in Casper, Wyo., in 1953. He eventually owned and operated hundreds of cable TV systems across the country. The firm he founded - Daniels &amp; Associates (now RBC Daniels) - provides investment-banking services to media and technology companies.<\/p>\n<p>When Bill Daniels died in 2000, his estate transferred to the Daniels Fund, which provides grants to nonprofit organizations and college scholarships to students in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, as well as supporting programs with a national impact.<\/p>\n<p>\"We are fortunate and honored that the Daniels Fund has chosen to help PICC build on Project Impact's momentum to make an even broader mark on the futures of its student participants,\" Curiel said. \"We feel certain that a civic engagement program that develops in young people a fuller appreciation for the American system and ideals fulfills the mission Bill Daniels set for his philanthropic work.<\/p>\n<p>\"An enhanced partnership with C-SPAN will allow PICC to incorporate technology to bring down walls, open access to students nationally and realize students' aspirations,\" she said.<\/p>\n<p>Linda Childears, Daniels Fund president and CEO, said, \"Bill Daniels was deeply patriotic. When he spoke to students, he often reminded them of the reasons he willingly risked his life defending the cause of freedom in two wars.<\/p>\n<p>\"As he established the Daniels Fund, Bill directed us to support programs in our Youth Development funding area that build character and provide the necessary life skills young people need to become engaged citizens.\"<\/p>\n<p>Hallmarks of PICC will be student participation, learning experiences and opportunities that nurture the next generation of engaged citizens at home, while building relationships with growing numbers of international students who will develop a better understanding of the United States.<\/p>\n<p>PICC's first event will be an energy forum focusing on fossil fuels, renewable energy and Purdue research while featuring nationally known scientists, industry leaders and journalists.<\/p>\n<p>A New Energy Future, sponsored by PICC and Bloomberg View, will be from 1:30-6 p.m. Sept. 13 in Stewart Center's Loeb Hall. It is free and open to the public.<\/p>\n<p>The event will feature two panel discussions and a Brian Lamb interview with Michael Eskew, UPS director and former chairman and CEO.<\/p>\n<p>More information on the forum is available at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/energy-forum,-new-name-kick-off-student-civic-communication-group.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/energy-forum,-new-name-kick-off-student-civic-communication-group.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Since its inception as Project Impact, PICC has helped students across the university sharpen their critical thinking and communication skills and build professional networks as they produced forums featuring historians, government officials, journalists, media executives and successful practitioners in their fields of interest.

This money will be matched by an equal amount though Purdue's Faculty Excellence Challenge Match, designed to endow new professorships.<\/p>\n<p>* $250,000 to create the Lamb Scholars, providing undergraduate scholarships for Indiana students. This money will be matched by an equal amount through the Indiana Challenge Match, designed to help Purdue offer financial aid to Indiana students.<\/p>\n<p>* $1 million in unrestricted funds to be used by the Lamb School in pursuit of its strategic objectives. A focus will be on engagement opportunities and co-curricular experiences, such as those currently offered by Project Impact as well as projects that promote the use of the C-SPAN Archives in research and teaching. Project Impact is an experiential learning initiative in which students produce forums with historians, government officials, journalists, media executives and successful practitioners in their fields of interest.<\/p>\n<p>\"We in the Lamb School are excited about the initiatives this gift will help bring about,\" said Steven Wilson, interim head of the school. \"We're gratified to have such a strong show of external support for our work and mission.\"<\/p>\n<p>Brian Lamb earned his bachelor's degree in speech from Purdue in 1963 and received an honorary doctorate in 1986. He founded C-SPAN - Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network - in 1977, and the network's initial telecasts of the U.S. House of Representatives began in 1979. Today there are three C-SPAN networks offering around-the-clock coverage of the political process.<\/p>\n<p>In 1987 Lamb designated Purdue as the home of the C-SPAN Archives, which records, indexes and archives all C-SPAN programming for historical, educational and research uses. The archives, operated and funded by C-SPAN, are located in the Purdue Research Park.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Judith Barra Austin, 765-494-2432, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/jbaustin@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jbaustin@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Mitch Daniels, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/president@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">president@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Irwin Weiser, 765-494-3661, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/iweiser@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">iweiser@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\nSteven Wilson, 765-494-0094, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/wilson25@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">wilson25@purdue.edu<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/7a58b3c896eab6a8c9a34f52e2099f38/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/purdues-brian-lamb-school-to-benefit-from-gift-valued-at-3-million.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Hovde Dean of the College of Science, said Zoltners' gift will help Purdue attract and retain a professor who excels in mathematics teaching and research.<\/p>\n<p>\"Mathematics is critical not only to the STEM fields for which Purdue is internationally known, but, as Dr. Zoltners' business success illustrates, it also offers the solution to problems across all disciplines,\" he said. \"A distinguished professorship in Dr. Zoltners' name is a fitting way to express pride in our alumnus and gratitude for his history of generosity to the Department of Mathematics and College of Science.\"<\/p>\n<p>Zoltners, of Chicago, applied his mathematics education to solving problems in the sales and marketing industry. He is a prominent author and expert in marketing models and sales force design and co-founder of ZS Associates, a global sales and marketing consulting firm in Chicago.<\/p>\n<p>He earned a master's degree in mathematics from Purdue in 1969 and in 1999 received a distinguished alumni award from the Department of Mathematics.<\/p>\n<p>After graduating from Purdue, Zoltners studied integer-programming algorithms and earned a doctoral degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 1973. In 1983 co-founded ZS Associates. Today ZS Associates has more than 1,000 employees and assists Global 500 companies and industries throughout the world.<\/p>\n<p>Zoltners also is a professor emeritus of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, where he has been a faculty member for more than 30 years. In 2005 Zoltners was inducted into the Chicago Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame.<\/p>\n<p>Zoltners said he has not forgotten the impact Purdue professors had on him and hopes that strong influence and guidance will be retained for future generations of mathematicians.<\/p>\n<p>\"To be competitive in world markets, the U.S. needs to produce the best educated scientists and mathematicians in the world,\" Zoltners said. \"Our universities are still the best in the world at scientific education and research. I am hoping in a small way to continue to build this asset and enhance the leadership.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Faculty Fund for Excellence was established earlier this year to raise private gifts to endow new professorships. Gifts of $750,000 or more will be matched up to $1 million from $7.25 million in matching university funds designated for faculty investment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Elizabeth K.

He received an honorary degree from Purdue in 1994.<\/p>\n<p>\"Dr. Hampton has a deep and longstanding commitment to Purdue,\" said Timothy Sands, the university's acting president and Basil S. Turner Professor of Engineering. \"Naming the building in the Hamptons' honor is an appropriate recognition and will serve as an ongoing tribute to his generosity and leadership.\"<\/p>\n<p>Hampton of Potomac, Md., is the founder of Delon Hampton &amp; Associates (DHA), a top design firm specializing in civil, structural and environmental engineering, and construction and program management and planning services. He was a civil engineering assistant professor at Kansas State University and a professor at Howard University. While on leave from Kansas State University, he served for a year as head of soil dynamics research at the University of New Mexico's Eric H. Wang Research Facility in Albuquerque.<\/p>\n<p>He has received the Edmund Friedman Professional Recognition Award and James Laurie Prize from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the Distinguished Engineer Award from the National Society of Black Engineers. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He is a past president of ASCE. During his tenure, he proposed the creation of ASCE's Outstanding Projects and Leaders (OPAL) Award, which was approved by the board and has been given each year since 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Hampton has served as a director of the Greater Washington (D.C.) Board of Trade, as a Malcolm Baldrige Award overseer for the U.S. Department of Commerce, and as a treasurer and director with the Center for National Policy.<\/p>\n<p>The civil engineering building was constructed in three phases. The original building was constructed in 1950, with the second phase added in 1961 and a final phase in 1986.<\/p>\n<p>\"Dr. Hampton's gift will allow the School of Civil Engineering to build on its long history of success,\" said Leah Jamieson, the John A.

A coffee shop and a commons area also were added.<\/p>\n<p>\"Purdue helped me get where I am in life today, so I am honored to be in a position to help others achieve their dreams,\" said Parrish, whose company consistently makes Black Enterprise magazine's BE 100 as one of the Top 100 Black Owned Businesses in the United States.<\/p>\n<div><img src=\"http://news.uns.purdue.edu/images/2010/parrish-r10.jpg\" width=\"120\"><p>Roland Parrish<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://news.uns.purdue.edu/images/2010/parrish-r10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Download image<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>He also is chair and CEO of the National Black McDonald's Owner's Association, a 40-year-old organization with $3.5 billion in sales and 1,400 restaurants.<\/p>\n<p>Parrish arrived at Purdue in 1971 on a full athletic scholarship, thanks to his success as a Hammond, Ind., high school All-American in track and field and his Indiana state title in the 800-meter run. He lettered four years on Purdue's track and field team, served as team captain in his senior year, and was voted MVP twice by his teammates. He was the first student recruited by his mentor, Cornell Bell, into Krannert's then-fledging Business Opportunity Program. The program is designed to create a more diverse student body and launch business and community leaders.<\/p>\n<p>He also performed in the Black Voices of Inspiration singing group at Purdue. Applying his athletic discipline to academics, he made the dean's list seven out of eight semesters.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the library, Parrish supports Purdue Athletics and the Krannert School. He also donated funds for the Lambert Fieldhouse scoreboard and a scholarship in memory of Bell. Another scholarship supports students through the Black Cultural Center.<\/p>\n<p>Parrish was honored in October 2010 with a Pinnacle Award, the highest recognition for philanthropic contributions to Purdue, and was named a Krannert Outstanding Alumnus in October 2011.

Córdova. \"We are very appreciative of this gift, which focuses on learning and student achievement.\"<\/p>\n<p>The gift, from an anonymous donor, will be used as a one-to-one match to generate a total of $20 million to construct and support the $30 million Center for Student Excellence and Leadership. This match also will provide an incentive to invest an additional $8 million in deferred gifts toward an endowment to support the facility's long-term maintenance and operating costs.<\/p>\n<p>Purdue Intercollegiate Athletics also is a key partner in this project, contributing $12 million over six years through Big Ten Network revenue toward the facility's total cost. Athletics director Morgan Burke said the new center would be an asset in recruiting students and student-athletes to Purdue because it will be a key element in the campus area dedicated to student life.<\/p>\n<p>The Student Success Corridor - a place where students live, study and play - is located along Third Street. It includes residence halls to the west, as well as the Recreational Sports Center, dining courts, Black Cultural Center, fraternity and sorority houses, and the new Vawter Field Residence Hall located between Wiley and Windsor residence halls.<\/p>\n<p>The motivation for the center came from students, and the concept was advanced with a team of students, faculty and staff that studied student needs as part of the \"launching tomorrow's leaders\" component of Purdue's New Synergies strategic plan.<\/p>\n<div><img src=\"http://news.uns.purdue.edu/images/2012/csel-render.jpg\" width=\"280\"><p>The Center for Student Excellence and Leadership is a critical element of the Student Success Corridor, which creates a bridge between residential and academic life.

The center also will be LEED-certified for energy efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>\"Purdue has high expectations for its students, and to be sure that they succeed we want to provide the resources, structure and opportunity to do so,\" said Timothy Sands, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. \"The new center enhances that support system by bringing together our key student services such as programs focused on retention, student activities and academic support.\"<\/p>\n<p>The building's first floor is designed to be a public space between work and home for faculty, staff and students to meet and interact. Students also will have access to an e-community where they can plug in and utilize a First Stop shop for students seeking assistance in their academic or co-curricular activities.<\/p>\n<p>\"The learning experience at a university is ongoing, and by supporting such opportunities beyond the classrooms, we help students apply what they learn in their studies to leadership and organizational settings that mirror career or community experiences after graduation,\" said Melissa Exum, vice president for student affairs. \"The new center will provide central space and offices for our diverse student organizations, and it also will create a community that inspires more students across all disciplines to engage in university life.\"<\/p>\n<p>The second floor will be the Student Organization Hub, which will provide individual office space as well as community work areas. The third floor will house Student Organization Support Services, such as Student Leadership Development, which will include the Leadership Engagement Institute, a one-of-a-kind program that will provide the framework for every Purdue student to engage in a leadership experience. Other programs on the third floor will be Boiler Volunteer Network, Student Activities and Organizations, and the business office for student organizations.<\/p>\n<p>The fourth floor is the Academic Success Hallway and will house Student Access, Transition and Success (SATS) and HORIZONS. These offices run the following programs, many of which have earned national recognition for their efforts in improving retention rates and academic success.<\/p>\n<p>* Boiler Gold Rush, the fall orientation program for first-year and transfer students.<\/p>\n<p>* Learning Communities, a program in which groups of 20-30 students take two or three courses together and often live in the same residence hall.<\/p>\n<p>* Purdue Promise, the program that supports low-income, first-generation college students through required courses, learning communities, peer mentoring and individual support from SATS staff.<\/p>\n<p>* Supplemental Instruction, an academic assistance program that offers students regularly scheduled peer-led study sessions.<\/p>\n<p>* Academic Success Center, a center that offers a variety of educational services and courses to individual students.<\/p>\n<p>* HORIZONS, a program that provides support in life and study skills for students who qualify based on financial need.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these programs, tutoring rooms and satellite locations of other existing academic help centers also will be located on the fourth floor.<\/p>\n<p>\"The Academic Success Hallway will be a living laboratory as we continue to develop programming and educational resources to improve the learning experience,\" said Dale Whittaker, vice provost for undergraduate academic affairs. \"For example, our orientation and retention programs continue to win awards, and we are in the second year of IMPACT, which is reshaping the traditional large-lecture classroom format for science, technology, education and mathematics courses.

This facility will be key to training students and expanding research opportunities, as well as improving wellness programs and clinics offered to the community.\"<br><br>\nLyles-Porter Hall, planned for approximately 61,000 assignable square feet, is named in honor of a $10 million 2009 gift from Marybeth Lyles-Porter Higuera (Pronounced EE-guera) of Visalia, Calif. Higuera is a former speech pathologist who earned her bachelor's degree in speech-language pathology in 1959.<br><br>\n\"My gift represents a tribute to my family, as well as an investment in Purdue, the place that first taught me to shine,\" Higuera said. \"I enjoyed a successful 20-year career as a speech pathologist thanks to my Purdue education, and I am excited that I can help others who are passionate about speech, communication and health in general.\"<br><br>\nThis new building, which also will house the <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/lafayette.medicine.iu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Indiana University School of Medicine - Lafayette<\/a> on the campus of Purdue, will be located at the northwest corner of Harrison and University streets in an area of campus known as the Life and Health Sciences Park. Lyles-Porter Hall also will have an 850-space attached parking facility. Purdue also celebrated plans on Wednesday (April 18) for the Drug Discovery Building to be constructed in the same area. Other facilities in this health and life sciences hub, which is located within State, University and Harrison streets and Jischke Drive, include Hansen Life Sciences Research, Agricultural and Biological Engineering, and Hockmeyer Hall of Structural Biology.<br><br>\nThe total cost for the building and attached parking structure is $54 million. In addition to $38 million in bond proceeds, gifts totaling $16 million will be used to build the facility. Construction is expected to begin this summer, and the building will open in 2014.<br><br>\n\"The <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/hhs/\" target=\"_blank\">College of Health and Human Sciences<\/a> was recently formed, but Purdue's Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences has a long and rich history,\" said Christine Ladisch, dean of the College of Health and Human Sciences.<br><br>\nThis spring, U.S.News &amp; World Report ranked the accredited master's degree in speech-language pathology fifth and the accredited doctor of audiology program 12th.<br><br>\n\"Today, the department is known for its research in areas such as child language development, brain mechanisms in stuttering and other language processing, speech challenges for Parkinson's disease patients, basic mechanisms of hearing, and assistive hearing devices,\" she said. \"It also is considered one of the top programs for student training, especially at the graduate level.\"<br><br>\nOne example is the doctor of audiology program, which is a collaboration between Purdue and the Indiana University School of Medicine's Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in Indianapolis. Thanks to this partnership, Purdue audiology students work in clinical settings through the medical school, such as pediatric audiology and a cochlear implant program.<br><br>\nPurdue and the Indiana University School of Medicine also have another partnership on campus through the IU School of Medicine at Lafayette program, which also will be housed in Lyles-Porter Hall. Each year 32 first- and second-year IU medical students are placed at the IUSM-Lafayette regional site on the Purdue campus, and after the new facility opens, that number will be increased to 48 and will expand to include third- and fourth-year students who will do clinical rotations in the Greater Lafayette area.<br><br>\n\"It is estimated that in 15 years, the state of Indiana will have 1,300 fewer doctors than it needs, reflective of the incoming physician shortage nationally,\" said Dr. D. Craig Brater, dean and Walter J. Daly Professor at the IU School of Medicine. \"Moreover, not only are we at risk of a shortage of raw numbers of physicians, the current shortage of primary care physicians will be exacerbated substantially. As a result, there is a great demand for medical schools to educate and train more doctors, and this new facility makes that possible. There also will be opportunities for the medical students at Purdue to interact with local physicians, enhancing the likelihood they will enter primary care as they will return to this area to meet the health-care needs of the future.\"<br><br>\nThe other programs and centers planned for Lyles-Porter Hall are:<br><br>\n* A.H. Ismail Center for Health, Exercise and Nutrition: This community resource will be an addition to the original site at Lambert Fieldhouse. The Ismail Center, which is a fitness center operated by the Department of Health and Kinesiology, features equipment and trainers in cardiovascular and strength training. Students gain clinical experience in health and fitness testing, exercise prescription, exercise leadership, counseling, and management.<br><br>\n* Nursing Center for Family Health: Will be relocated from Johnson Hall, and gives nursing students clinical experience when working with faculty to provide free health promotion screenings for Purdue employees, their spouses, graduate students and university retirees.<br><br>\n* Nutritional Training and Research Center: The training aspect of this program is to provide clinical experience for nutrition science students, and space will be available for research studies coordinated by faculty in the Department of Nutrition Science.<br><br>\n* Purdue Psychology Treatment and Research Clinics: Delivers psychological services to adults, children and families in the community. Therapists are qualified psychologists-in-training who are supervised by licensed faculty members from the Department of Psychological Sciences.<br><br>\n* M.D. Steer Audiology and Speech-Language Clinics: The audiology clinic provides diagnostic and rehabilitative services for all ages and averages 1,700 patient visits a year. The clinic serves multiple counties statewide and is a hearing health-care provider for newborns and infants who have been identified with hearing loss. Other services include providing hearing aids, assistive listening devices, and group and individual therapy. The speech clinic averages 2,500 client visits annually and offers many programs, including an adult language program for clients with language problems following stroke or other brain injuries, a birth-to-3 program, a Brain Builders program for clients with dementia, the Purdue Preschool Language Program, treatment for stuttering in preschoolers through adulthood, and voice therapy in conjunction with area physicians.<br><br>\n\"Parking and location convenience will be a great benefit with this new facility to help the patients of all ages that we see,\" said Keith R. Kluender, professor and head of the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences. \"The clinics offer care and services to meet community needs, as well as supervised clinical training for our students. Through our clinics and services throughout the state, we help more than 4,700 people every year, many of whom would not receive specialized care without us.\"<br><br>\nThere are currently 22 research and tenure-track faculty and 15 clinical faculty members in the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences. Purdue's speech pathology program began in 1935 to assist students who had speech problems. In 1948 the first doctoral degree was awarded. Purdue's programs were among the first in the country to achieve accreditation in speech pathology and audiology from the Educational Standards Board, now known as the Council for Academic Accreditation, of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA).<br><br>\nHiguera, who also completed a master's degree in audiology from California State University of Long Beach, worked in public schools in California, including Kingsburg, where she designed and implemented the first full-time speech therapy program. The building is named for the grandfathers of her four children.<br><br>\nThe paternal grandfather is George A. Porter, who graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1922, and the maternal grandfather is her father, William M. Lyles Jr., who earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1935. Higuera's mother, Elizabeth Lyles, also earned a bachelor's degree in science in 1933 and a master's degree in science education in 1934. Higuera's grandfather, the late H. Gerald Venemann, graduated from Purdue in 1907 and retired from Purdue in 1954 as professor emeritus of mechanical engineering. Her brothers, Gerald V. Lyles and William M. Lyles, also are Purdue alumni. One of her four children, Thomas W. Porter, attended Purdue and earned a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering in 1985.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong>  Amy Patterson Neubert, 765-494-9723, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/general/2012/apatterson@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">apatterson@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong>  France A.

Corley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry.<br><br>\n\"Our intention is to draw the attention of the world to not only the current quality of research in this field that is taking place at Purdue, but also to our future potential as we expand and enhance our strength in the area.\"<br><br>\nThe facility will partially replace space in the Wetherill Laboratory of Chemistry, where a group led by Low has developed novel treatments for cancer and inflammatory diseases.<br><br>\n\"We have carefully considered the construction of the building in every detail and have designed it to be very flexible so that it can accommodate multiple research focuses and areas,\" Low said, adding that the lab space will be conducive to seamless altering. \"The new building will be very open inside with continuous space that will extend from one lab into the next. We believe this not only allows for maximum versatility, but it also will promote collaborations more easily and enable sharing of equipment and resources.\"<br><br>\nThe lab design will allow undergraduate and graduate students to observe experiments from outside through glass barriers.<br><br>\n\"They'll be able to watch some of the more senior researchers perform experiments without having to knock on a door,\" Low said.<br><br>\nPurdue researchers that will move into the new facility have not yet been identified, but are expected to originate from myriad disciplines.<br><br>\n\"The anticipation is that they will come from multiple schools, multiple departments and multiple buildings,\" Low said. \"There is existing strength at the university in cancer research that is facilitated strongly by the success of the Purdue Center for Cancer Research. I think there may be a focus on this area, but the Drug Discovery Building won't be exclusively committed to that disease.\"<br><br>\nPurdue will soon commence a search for two researchers in the area of drug discovery to work at the new facility.<br><br>\n\"We will go out and find two of the top stars in the country, or even the world, to join us here,\" Low said. \"At the present, we're not restricting ourselves to any field of interest or disease focus. We simply want scientists who are interested in designing and making new drugs, and also in translating these discoveries into the clinic. We also feel we need to include in our mission statement the desire not only to discover new medicines, but also to assure that they benefit the people we serve.\"<br><br>\nPurdue will combine up to $5 million in funds from gifts and facility and administrative cost recovery with $20 million in bond proceeds to pay for the project.<br><br>\n\"It's a very exciting opportunity for the university, and I believe it's going to greatly enhance the ability of the faculty interested in drug discovery to achieve their goals. I think because of this you'll see new spin-off companies develop in the community,\" Low said. \"You'll also see a lot of other outside researchers visit here. This will be a place where researchers will want to come to learn how to do drug discovery.\"<br><br>\nAs part of Wednesday's (April 18) event, the university also celebrated plans for Lyles-Porter Hall, a new facility to house Purdue's nationally ranked Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences and medical and health programs that provide students a variety of learning and clinical experiences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong>  Brian Peloza, 765-494-2081, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/general/2012/bpeloza@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">bpeloza@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong>  France A.

Gifts from $750,000 to $1 million will be matched dollar for dollar. The program could total $14.5 million for new distinguished and named professorships.<\/p>\n<p>\"Named and distinguished professorships offer a way for the university to recognize contributions by faculty to their areas of expertise,\" said Timothy D. Sands, Purdue's executive vice president for academic affairs and provost, and also the Basil S. Turner Professor of Engineering. \"They allow us to recruit, reward and retain professors who excel in teaching and research.\"<\/p>\n<p>The university currently has 190 named and distinguished professorships.<\/p>\n<p>\"The number of endowed professorships is one indication of a university's prestige and an important way to recognize the significant work of its faculty,\" said Beverly Davenport Sypher, vice provost for faculty affairs. \"We have many extraordinary faculty whose work will be enhanced because of the funds made possible by these donors.\"<\/p>\n<p>Gifts can be for professorships in any university college or school. Because the matching funds are not restricted, the donor will have sole rights to name the associated professorship, including in memory of, or in honor of, another individual.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, contact the Purdue Development Office at 765-494-2727, toll-free at 800-677-8780 or by email at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/general/2012/gifts@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">gifts@purdue.edu<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Writer: Judith Barra Austin, 765-494-2432, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/general/2012/jbaustin@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jbaustin@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sources: France A.

We want to give them a rich experience from which to make these decisions - and to offer them support - so they are successful in whatever path they choose.\"<\/p>\n<p>For most sophomores this research experience will be their first, he said.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is uncommon for a sophomore to participate in research, especially for a full year, but we want to change that,\" Ward said. \"We want students to know they don't have to know it all or be an expert before joining a research team. They can jump right in and learn as they go. Purdue students are enthusiastic and capable, and we want to create a culture and climate that is really supportive of undergraduate research.\"<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Ward, members of the grant-winning team are professors of statistics Rebecca Doerge, Jun Xie, Hao Zhang and Lingsong Zhang, who will help lead the program, and professors Guang Cheng, Sharon Christ, Hyonho Chun, Bruce Craig, Frederi Viens and Xiao Wang.<\/p>\n<p>A $9400/year stipend will be given to participating students, so that they may focus on their academics and research experience, he said. The grant provides funding for 20 students each year, beginning in the fall of 2014, and spans five years. The program is open to students in any major, but is focused on statistics and would likely involve those from other areas adding a statistics major, Ward said.<\/p>\n<p>The program also will offer a new course in data analysis and visualization.<\/p>\n<p>\"We want to get students comfortable with large data sets and visualization tools earlier,\" Ward said. \"The 'big data' problem is only going to become more important as time goes by. The way we teach statistics and data analysis is rapidly evolving.\"<\/p>\n<p>The size of Purdue's undergraduate program in the <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.stat.purdue.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Statistics<\/a> has more than doubled in the last five years (an increase from 200 to more than 400 students), and employment opportunities in the field continue to increase, Ward said.<\/p>\n<p>\"Everybody has data, and companies need people well-suited to analyze it,\" he said. \"Statistics has applications in almost every field. This program will represent that breadth, because faculty in other departments are collaborating with us, providing both data sets and mentoring in applied research opportunities. I think it will be eye opening for the students to see how statistics affects other fields and can be applied to real-world problems.\"<\/p>\n<p>The learning community will be a part of the <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/studentsuccess/orientation/learning_communities/\" target=\"_blank\">Learning Community Program within Student Success<\/a> at Purdue. Participating students will live together in a residence hall, so that they may connect with their peers and discuss research in an encouraging team-oriented climate, Ward said. Students also will dine with their professors as part of a faculty fellow program.<\/p>\n<p>The program also will offer professional development opportunities for increased mentoring, especially for women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Ward hopes the program will be another big success for his department.<\/p>\n<p>\"Purdue Statistics has a consulting program for graduate students, that many departments across the country have recreated,\" he said. \"I would love for this sophomore undergraduate experience to become a nationwide model for how we train students at the sophomore level.\"<\/p>\n<p>Partners in the program include the College of Science, College of Engineering, College of Health and Human Sciences, and the Honors College; the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering; Discovery Learning Research Center; Office of the Dean of Students; Housing and Food Services; Information Technology at Purdue; Libraries; the Purdue Chapter of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS); and Student Success in the Office of the Provost.

He has been instrumental in supporting and growing undergraduate research opportunities, investing in faculty research grants and creating interdisciplinary faculty positions,\" said Timothy Sands, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. \"He also worked to successfully restore a balanced budget, and he guided the college through a two-year transition as part of a realignment with the College of Health and Human Sciences. We are appreciative for his leadership in moving the College of Liberal Arts forward.\"<\/p>\n<p>Chris Ladisch, dean of the College of Health and Human Sciences, is leading the search for the next Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts. A search committee will be named this month, and a new dean is expected be announced by the end of the spring semester.<\/p>\n<p>Weiser will remain at Purdue and return to teaching in the Department of English where he was previously head from 2002-09. His primary area of interest is composition pedagogy, and he has focused his graduate teaching on topics such as writing across the curriculum, writing assessment and composition research methods.<\/p>\n<p>\"It has been an honor to serve the College of Liberal Arts and Purdue as dean,\" Weiser said. \"I have appreciated and learned from the opportunities I have had to work with truly gifted members of the faculty and staff of the college, with inspiring and engaged students, with committed and loyal alumni, and with my generous and creative fellow deans and other members of the Purdue administration. I look forward to continuing my support of the college that plays a central role in the education of every Purdue undergraduate student.\"<\/p>\n<p>The College of Liberal Arts is one of the largest at Purdue, with more than 275 tenured or tenure-track faculty, more than 3,700 undergraduate students, and 770 graduate students. The college houses the Brian Lamb School of Communication, the Patti and Rusty Rueff School of Visual and Performing Arts, and the School of Languages and Cultures, as well as the departments of Anthropology, Communication, English, History, Philosophy, Political Science, and Sociology. The college also is home to 15 interdisciplinary studies programs and a variety of centers including the Center for Research on Diversity and Inclusion and the Center on Religion and Chinese Society.<\/p>\n<p>The dean of the College of Liberal Arts is an endowed deanship, named in honor of Justin S. Morrill, and one of only four such college deanships at Purdue. Morrill was a driving force in the 1862 College Land Grant Act, which created the foundation for universities such as Purdue. The legislation is now known as the Morrill Act in his honor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amy Patterson Neubert, 765-494-9723, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/apatterson@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">apatterson@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Timothy Sands, 765-494-9709, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/tsands@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">tsands@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Irwin Weiser, 765-494-3661, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/iweiser@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">iweiser@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/purdue-launches-search-for-liberal-arts-dean.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

It can be found at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/purdue.edu/passnote\" target=\"_blank\">http://purdue.edu/passnote<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Kyle Bowen, director of informatics in Information Technology at Purdue, says the messages are based on academic research in communications and education on the most effective message lengths, word choices and requested actions.<\/p>\n<p>\"This is the first app that we've built that comes with its own bibliography,\" Bowen says.<\/p>\n<p>The app was designed using research on effective academic communications conducted at Purdue by Matt Pistilli, who led the research team behind PassNote.<\/p>\n<p>For example, research has shown that the ideal length for a corrective message to a student is about 54 words, or roughly twice the length of a Twitter message. Any longer, and the students often stopped reading.<\/p>\n<p>\"That limit is Twitteresque in that it forces you to carefully select each word,\" Pistilli says. \"But if you are concise you can actually say quite a bit in a message of that length.\"<\/p>\n<p>To use the app, instructors first select a topic, such as attendance or missed assignments, and then select a level, indicated by red, yellow or green tabs, that reflects the student's behavior. The app then provides a selection of sentences or phrases that the instructor can drag and drop into a window to construct a message.<\/p>\n<p>The message is automatically copied into the user's clipboard, so the instructor can then paste the message into an email, an online learning program, or even into a Twitter or Facebook direct message.<\/p>\n<p>\"The technology helps the instructor to provide actionable feedback no matter what technology they are using,\" Bowen says.<\/p>\n<p>Pistilli says the application will improve as more instructors use it.<\/p>\n<p>\"We'll be looking at which phrases get used, which ones are never used and what the final messages look like,\" he says. \"We'll take this information and combine it with the direct feedback we get from users to continually improve the tool.\"<\/p>\n<p>At Purdue, the PassNote app will be combined with the Signals student success data analytics tool to quantitatively measure the effectiveness of the messages to further improve the tool.<\/p>\n<p>PassNote is one of eight classroom apps created by the Purdue Studio project. The apps can be used by instructors or students to enhance the traditional classroom experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Steve Tally, 765-494-9809, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/tally@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">tally@purdue.edu<\/a>, Twitter: sciencewriter<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Kyle Bowen, 765-496-7486, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/kbowen@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kbowen@purdue.edu<\/a>, Twitter: @kyledbowen<\/p>\nMatt Pistilli, 765-494-6746, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/mpistilli@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">mpistilli@purdue.edu<\/a>, Twitter: @mdpistilli<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/website-helps-instructors-write-motivating-messages.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

The forum will be one of three during the fall semester to focus on Purdue's 10 next big moves. All will feature Daniels along with panelists who are leading the new initiatives. <\/p>\n<p>\"We in higher education are facing questions - and rightfully so - about the cost of college and what we deliver for the money,\" Daniels said. \"This plan aims to address some of those questions while enhancing what Purdue has always done best: produce brilliant research and students who are well-rounded and ready to go into the world and make an impact where our nation needs it most.\"<\/p>\n<p>All of the moves that will be rolled out fall into the following categories: science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) achievement; world-changing research; transformative education; and affordability and accessibility.<\/p>\n<p>Daniels said the initiatives were developed over several months of work that involved deans, faculty and others at the university. The university's trustees also have reviewed and given support for the program.<\/p>\n<p>\"This plan presents an extraordinary opportunity for Purdue to set itself apart by decisively answering the tough questions and sending the message that we are serious about our students and our research,\" said Thomas Spurgeon, chair of the university's Board of Trustees. \"When combined with the ongoing excellence across our campus, these new initiatives will place Purdue among the world's greatest academic institutions and serve as a source of pride for our alumni, students and supporters.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Brian Zink, 765-494-2080, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/bzink@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">bzink@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Mitch Daniels, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/president@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">president@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\nThomas Spurgeon, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/trustees@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">trustees@purdue.edu<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/purdue-readies-rollout-of-major-campus-initiatives.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

I should be wearing my Janus mask too--Janus, the ancient Roman god of doorways whose double face looks one way into the   future, and another way, to the past. He isn't confused or worried, just curious, and thoughtful. You <i>finish<\/i> as you <i>commence<\/i>, and this is the delicious moment of your passage.<br><br>\nSo allow yourself a little time travel. Soon this place will be <i>that<\/i> place, <i>back there<\/i>, and your visits here 10, 20, 30 years from now will startle you—the hallways of the buildings you knew so well will seem narrow, the ceilings lower, the students unthinkably young, everything so strange, almost surreal. You will be moved by the grief in that, and the wonder of ever having been so young yourself, that your years here were the occasion of a transformation you weren't quite aware was even happening when you were in the sweet, bewildering thick of it. And for those of you older, who came to begin or continue your education, in future visits this place will become the site of your daring and deliberation, and the great breath of relief and triumph in earning this degree. How the past morphs into the years to come can be both lovely and unsettling.<br>\n <br>\nAlong those lines are more immediate matters to consider. My one-of-a-kind, most wonderful dentist, for instance, Bill Risk (Purdue, 1959!) who has practiced many decades now in Lafayette, as did his father and uncle before him. I love our chats when I am trapped in his chair with a little paper bib clipped around my neck. He's a superb conversationalist, as wild as his name, though I have to admit, it's hard to get a word in edgewise when he's packed my mouth with cotton and a dental dam, and I can only mumble enthusiastically in response. No matter. Dr. Risk is rich with stories, and my favorite orbits around a little cardboard suitcase. <\/p>\n<p>It seems that every summer, as children, he and his older brother were packed off from Lafayette to the state of Maine by train, to spend several weeks at a camp owned by their Uncle Clarence. Yet Dr. Risk's story begins much earlier. Sight-unseen, in 1928, a naturalist was hired to work at the camp, a 20-year-old who would continue to come by train too, summer after summer, his eye and ear alert to the woods. The first time though, Uncle Clarence was late in picking up his new staff member at the town depot, arriving a few minutes after the train had come and gone. He looked around and spotted a young man sitting stiffly on a bench, a small cardboard suitcase beside him. <\/p>\n<p>\"But get this,\" Dr. Risk said to me, \"that young man was….\" And here he paused, leaning closer—“Guess!\"   <br>\nI raised my eyebrows, making a choked, muffled sound to mean <i>how would I know? Come on, Dr. Risk, tell me already!<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\"ROGER TORY PETERSON!\" he stage-whispered, very loud.<br>\n <br>\nNow, I'm a birder, meaning I watch birds and am slowly learning their songs. And to a birder or to anyone even vaguely smitten with the natural world, this guy, Roger Tory Peterson—the writer of so many excellent guides to that world—is legend, hero, a saint, of sorts. He actually invented the modern go-to of that genre.<br>\n <br>\nAnd if you don't believe me,\" Dr. Risk continued, practically singing now, \"check your Peterson guide. Uncle Clarence is THERE, right on the dedication page!\"<br>\n <br>\nGoing home, I did, I checked my old, beloved bird books. And he's right—Clarence Allen <i>is<\/i> warmly thanked on that page, edition after edition. Need I say that it delights me, Dr. Risk's joy in repeating this story?  But a poignant detail continues to haunt, and begins to <i>mean<\/i> in larger ways, and in that lies the lasting power--and poetry--of image. That little cardboard suitcase. Which is pretty much all he had, the young man waiting at that town's tiny depot, on the verge of<i> <\/i>the remarkable fate that would befall him, however long it would take.  <\/p>\nMy point, on this weighty occasion?  Of course, and duh!: everyone starts somewhere. That little cardboard suitcase.  Think of it as your education, as the key thing to cherish. Or as we often say in our house: the key to the treasure IS the treasure. Still, you must be ready for surprise.<br>\n <br>\nAnd here is where I welcome the 19th century British poet John Keats to this party, decent company for all of us. He died young, at 25, ravaged by the scourge totally mystifying in his era, tuberculosis, though he'd done a lot by then: hiked England and Scotland, fell in love, studied medicine for several years. It was terrible, the training required of doctors-to-be in the early 1800s, his assisting in surgeries before anesthesia, or any way to disinfect wounds; day after day his patients in agony, crying out as he cut into skin and muscle, vein and artery, legs going dark with gangrene. The dissection lab in his medical school at London's Guy's Hospital closed down in summer, given its unbearable stench.<br>\n <br>\nBut Keats had options, other gifts in his cardboard suitcase. One was his passion for literature and language. Which is to say, his education—both his formal schooling and what he read on his own—allowed him, in the parlance of our time and place, a kind of \"second major.\" Or just say his serious heart-and-bone- chilling work as an apprentice-physician deepened his thought and sense and shook him to the core, which turned out to be absolutely crucial to his writing. A small riff from his \"Ode to a Nightingale\" proves that, where the poet sets his dream of  \"song\" and \"mirth,\" his plea for \"a beaker full of the warm South\" against what clearly is drawn from his crushing experience of hospital life-- \"the weariness, the fever, and the fret/Here, where men sit and     hear each other groan… \"Note to self then, and to all of you: everything matters! Get curious. Let things stick to you. You never know where your life will lead, to what discoveries of self and world.<br>\n <br>\nThus the poems John Keats left behind, and his remarkable correspondence too. In one of those letters, he found this key to the universe, something he called \"negative capability,\" a willful turn of mind he claimed Shakespeare had, that made a person \"capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason…. \"To hover for a while amid seeming contradictions, to live comfortably with chaos and conflict, part wary of everything, part considering all sides--that's the trick perhaps, to savor such troubling moments as fruitful, a useful way to begin to understand what happens as the years mount up and weigh us down. William Blake, another English poet, had a similar thought that's often quoted, his \"without contraries there is no progression\"—which takes us a little farther, directly toward a goal, I suppose, into \"progression,\" the next step. But it's Keats who honors the \"beginner's mind,\" a point of wonder and humility out of which genuine engagement grows. Keep alert to what's opposite, and surprising. At the very least you will never be bored.<br>\n <br>\nBecause here's the rewarding, demanding part of this whole business of the future: most education is self-education. You're not done, I'm not done. But that's good news. It isn't simply the amassing of facts and figures. It's a habit of thought and feeling and being, of opening and questioning and including. And that's what Purdue has offered you. Keep doing it! Give it time. The growth of the imagination is a life-long trust.  Here's the truth: imagination—it’s not artsy-light or frivolous or mere frosting on the cake. Though it must be at the heart of genius, it's better than that--it's bottom-line, deep down, grubby day after day <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">practical<\/span>.  <br>\n <br>\nCase in point: I listened once as Chicago artist Susanna Coffey described a taxi ride she took in that city. Suddenly some crazy driver peeled out of an alley, nearly colliding and ripping through her passenger door. I said <i>nearly.<\/i> The cabbie hit the brakes and swerved safely, and all was well. And did he blurt out what most of us would have? A loud <i>Geez!<\/i> and <i>What a jerk!  <\/i>No. After a minute, she heard him say quietly, through clenched teeth: <i>that guy   has<\/i>   <i>no imagination.<\/i> There it is then: imagination as a key to empathy, to seeing through to possibilities <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">beyond<\/span> conclusion, to <i>not<\/i> cracking up your car.<br>\n <br>\nI imagine and hope for you a few things other than your getting back in one piece today, on your drive home. For one, money must be made--necessary now, and probably forever--but when you love what you do, and believe in something larger than your own gain, you actually forget about that. Do you know what that's called? Freedom.  As for the computer, the TV: beware. But you already get that—right – how they can lobotomize you, how the cheapest elements of our culture can flash from those screens. We're all susceptible, believe me.  Just be braver than your handheld; turn it off and talk to people, face to face. And in the years to come, there's always John Keats to channel on occasion or a lot, his holding back at first, his light touch welcoming doubt and mystery and uncertainty to help you figure your way through the world. Part of that means continuing to read good stuff—widely and with hunger, beyond your usual interests and take on things.<br>\n <br>\nThe great subjects of poetry are pretty simple: death, love, time, knowledge, beauty. They don't need much help coming down to us, playing out in the familiar, the sweet ordinary. Think about route 65 or 231, say, driving through Indiana, passing the vast realms of soybeans and corn, distant houses, small towns whose names on signs puzzle or charm. And the hay you see, bundled up after harvest, huge rolls of it scattered in the fields: I love the poet Jane Kenyon's lines about that. \"I wish you would look at the hay,\" she wrote, \"the beautiful, sane and solid bales of hay.\"  Note that rare and sacred word: <i>sane<\/i>. Take that with you, in your cardboard suitcase.<br>\n <br>\nWe'll all be under the sod in a hundred years. Relish your life. So what if most of our days turn in their familiar orbit of wake and work and sleep, our habits, all the little compelling weirdnesses that absorb us. That's solace, and good grounding. But there's also the sight of Earth from afar, from the astronaut's cockpit window. Your mission—should you choose to accept it—is to make peace and honest trouble between those separate worlds until what is small looms large, and what is large opens to us, eye-level, fully human.<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/professor-boruch-to-graduates.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Members also voted to merge the Department of Information Systems and the Department of Finance and Economics and to change the name of all academic units from schools to colleges.<\/p>\n<p>The name of the Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management will be changed to the White Lodging School of Hospitality and Tourism Management and move to the College of Business. Purdue Calumet Chancellor Thomas Keon said the department's faculty unanimously voted to approve the changes earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>The new Department of Information Systems, Finance and Business Analytics will combine relevant disciplines into one department in the College of Business, Keon said.<\/p>\n<p>\"The reorganization allows more opportunities for collaboration and program updates consistent with university goals and with industry needs,\" Keon said. \"This is especially relevant as employers of our students are calling for database management and business analysis skills.\"<\/p>\n<p>Keon said changing the names of schools to colleges is to be consistent with other Purdue system campuses. The name changes include:<\/p>\n<p>* School of Management to College of Business<\/p>\n<p>* School of Education to College of Education<\/p>\n<p>* School of Engineering, Mathematics and Science to College of Engineering, Mathematics and Science<\/p>\n<p>* School of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences to College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences<\/p>\n<p>* School of Nursing to College of Nursing<\/p>\n<p>* School of Technology to College of Technology<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer<\/strong>: Greg McClure, 765-496-9711, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/gmcclure@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">gmcclure@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong>  Timothy Sands, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost, 765-494-9709, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/tsands@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">tsands@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\nThomas Keon, chancellor of Purdue University Calumet, 219-989-2204, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/tkeon@purduecal.edu\" target=\"_blank\">tkeon@purduecal.edu<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/trustees-approve-several-changes-at-purdue-calumet.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Thirty-five graduate students from 25 U.S. universities, including Purdue, are in the 2013 class.<\/p>\n<p>The institute is a component of a five-year program to train U.S. graduate students in food security and global challenges in sustainable agriculture and related fields such as climate change, water, energy, economics, policy, technology and the environment. It is part of the U.S. Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security program, funded by a $5 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development.<\/p>\n<p>Students successfully completing the summer program are encouraged to apply for a Borlaug Fellows graduate research grant. Purdue student Ian Pope received a $15,000 grant to conduct research that focuses on detecting historical deforestation of the Guatemalan cloud forest and how inefficient agricultural practices in deforested areas threaten the long-term viability of soil quality for future generations.<\/p>\n<p>\"For me, the summer institute drove home the message that research aimed at solving the problems associated with global food security must take a trans-disciplinary approach,\" Pope said. \"The collaboration between academia and governmental and non-governmental organizations is critical for us to gain traction in what is arguably one of the most daunting challenges of the 21st century.\"<\/p>\n<p>The summer institute includes lectures, reviews of case studies, small-group discussions and field trips.<\/p>\n<p>Instructors are from Purdue and other institutions. They include faculty, practitioners and policymakers who have expertise in the natural, social and health sciences, and engineering and in integrated approaches to solving problems.<\/p>\n<p>Key speakers this year include Paul Schickler, president of DuPont Pioneer; Philip E. Nelson, retired Purdue food scientist and 2007 recipient of the World Food Prize; Lisa Eakman, executive director of the Global Agriculture and Food Initiative of The Chicago Council on Global Affairs; and Pamela Anderson, director general of the International Potato Center.<\/p>\n<p>Sofia Feng is among three students from the first institute who will return to tell the 2013 class how their experiences during the program have helped them in their education and research.<\/p>\n<p>\"The 2012 Borlaug Summer Institute has been one of the most remarkable moments during my journey as a graduate student in the U.S.,\" said Feng, who is from Costa Rica and is pursuing a doctorate in food science and nutrition at North Carolina State University.<\/p>\n<p>Also returning to the institute for a presentation will be Julie Borlaug, assistant director for partnerships of The Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture at Texas A&amp;M University.

Horne, associate vice provost for enrollment management and dean of admissions. \"For example, the new Honors College is a priority for many of these top students. We also have personalized recruiting strategies in which administrators, such as Purdue President Mitch Daniels, call top students to encourage them to choose Purdue. These initiatives make an impact on many admitted students and their families.\"<\/p>\n<p>The projected percentage of Indiana students accepting admissions to Purdue this year is 59.8 percent, which is up compared to last year's 58.4 percent. These students' academic credentials are also on the rise. At this time, the average SAT composite score is up 21 points to 1770 this year, which will be updated when enrollment figures and student academic profiles are finalized in September. Since 2009, the average SAT total score for first-year students has increased 62 points.<\/p>\n<p>More of the state's highest achievers also are choosing Purdue.<\/p>\n<p>This year 334 of Indiana's top students - those with an A high school grade average and a total SAT score of 2100 - are expected to enroll at Purdue. That number is up from 281 in 2012 and 240 in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>\"In an unprecedented way, Purdue is the destination for high-achieving Indiana students,\" said Daniels, who has contacted high school seniors who received some of Purdue's top scholarship awards - such as Presidential Scholars, Trustees, Emerging Leaders, Steven C. Beering and Stamps Family Charitable Foundation - to congratulate and welcome them to Purdue. \"Any student arriving this fall can get an education at Purdue that is equal to or better than that at any university in the country at a cost far lower.\"<\/p>\n<p>The number of applications to Purdue also continues to climb. At this time, the West Lafayette campus has received 30,804 applications, up 0.2 percent from this time last year. If the trend continues, applications are expected to be a new record or hold with last year's all-time high of 30,903. Horne said interest in Purdue continues to increase because the university is known for the value of its education and its high return on investment.<\/p>\n<p>The president and many deans have spent their evenings calling admitted students to answer questions and speak to interested parents, Horne said. Current students also reach out to accepted students to answer questions about academic programs and campus life.<\/p>\n<p>Purdue's academic strength also is enhanced with the new Honors College, Horne said. This fall the college is expecting more than 620 first-year students, which is 100 more than anticipated. Recruiting efforts for this group of students include special campus visit days with opportunities for high school students to sit in on current honors classes. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amy Patterson Neubert, 765-494-9723, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/apatterson@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">apatterson@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources<\/strong>: Pamela T.

Purdue's spring commencement, with five ceremonies between Friday and Sunday (May 12) in Elliott Hall of Music on campus, marked Daniels' first as president.<\/p>\n<p>\"In a few minutes, you will own for life one of the proudest emblems of achievement anywhere on the planet, a diploma from Purdue University. You will validate its worth as you move through lives of personal success and satisfaction. But you will fully honor it only as you invent, or start up, or build, or teach, or lead others in ways that alter and thereby continue the world's upward path.\"<\/p>\n<p>While acknowledging today's graduates face realities such as an inherited national debt, personal loans for the education they have received and a tough economy, Daniels expressed optimism that they will succeed. He also pointed out past instances where sages and sophisticated models predicted doom.<\/p>\n<p>\"But they were wrong,\" he said, \"because they fell into the oldest of traps, the fallacy of extrapolation. They failed to imagine that human ingenuity, first and foremost scientific and technological ingenuity, creates enormous and often sudden discontinuities that demolish the old forecasts and reset in fundamental ways the path of mankind's progress. The steam engine, the automobile, the Green Revolution, the silicon chip...  No matter how often history repeats, the doomsayers never see the next one coming.<\/p>\n<p>\"And they fail to account for one more thing: great leadership, the kind that can bring to bear the power of reason, and the lessons of history, and the skills of persuasion, to change minds and hearts and, therefore, both private action and public policies.<\/p>\n<p>\"That's what Boilermakers do. They imagine, conceive, devise and finally engineer the breakthroughs that create the resets and the discontinuities.\"<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate, Daniels spoke of the countless lives saved from starvation by Purdue's two World Food Prize winners, Philip Nelson and Gebisa Ejita, and of Ward Cunningham's inventions that enabled a new mode of collaboration and gave the world a new word: \"wiki.\"<\/p>\n<p>He noted that Purdue innovations every year create new jobs, wealth and life opportunities for innumerable others.<\/p>\n<p>\"There's something else Boilermakers do,\" Daniels said. \"Armed with a rounded education, rich in the liberal arts, they go into the world prepared to lead and to teach in a time of unprecedented complexity. Engineers and scientists who can distill, demystify and communicate complex questions to their fellow citizens; liberal arts graduates who absorbed enough of the transformative science of the day to teach it to our children or help shape the sound choices and tradeoffs that a free society must make together.<\/p>\n<p>\"I make no pretense to special foresight, and I don't claim to know with certainty that humankind will again overcome the very real threats it faces. But I know this: In this audience, and in the graduating classes that preceded and will follow you, are people who will make huge differences, quite possibly the kind that reset all the forecasts and send the pessimists back to their gloomy little corners.\"<\/p>\n<p><b>A copy of Daniels' full speech is available at:<\/b><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/president-daniels-to-graduates-your-turn-at-the-plate-has-come.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/president-daniels-to-graduates-your-turn-at-the-plate-has-come.html<\/a><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Writer: Jim Bush, 765-494-2077, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/jsbush@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsbush@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Contact: President Mitch Daniels, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/president@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">president@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/daniels-to-grads-world-may-be-uncertain-but-boilermakers-shouldnt-be.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

They are a fascinating experiment in delivering educational content at scale, but I don't believe that they will have a long-term effect on higher education in their present form.\"<\/p>\n<p>Instead, McCartney has identified four other megatrends that he predicts will transform higher education.<\/p>\n<p>To highlight the areas of change, McCartney and his staff created a video called \"The New Logistics of Knowledge.\" The video can be found on the associated website at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/newlogisticsofknowledge\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.purdue.edu/newlogisticsofknowledge<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\"In the video we attempted to show, in as concise a way as possible, how quickly and dramatically consumer behavior is changing in the United States and the world, and how Purdue has responded to these changes to this point,\" McCartney says.<\/p>\n<p>The video focuses on key indicators in four areas that McCartney says can be viewed as either challenges or opportunities. Regardless, he says, change will come in these four areas over the next few years.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">An always-on world:<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Today, people can buy something online at any hour of the day, any day of the year, and they do. Although online sales are hardly news, in 2012 North American online retail sales increased 36 percent. Even more striking is the rapid increase of purchases made through mobile devices. Similarly, McCartney predicts that people will expect to be able to consume educational material 24 hours a day from almost any location.<\/p>\n<p>\"What this means for universities is that we can't just be open from 8 to 5 any longer,\" he says. \"Students need assistance, scientists need resources, applicants need information at all hours of the day, every day of the year. We need to be ready to provide that.\"<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Mobile dominance:<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>In 2009 mobile device traffic accounted for just 1 percent of Internet traffic in the United States. In 2012 that had increased to 13 percent, and it is projected to be 80 percent by 2015.<\/p>\n<p>\"This will mean more than just making sure that our websites can be viewed on mobile devices,\" McCartney says. \"These devices offer too many advantages to not do our best to see how we can use them to improve student success and engagement in their courses.\"<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Multiple delivery options:<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Whatever the final judgment on MOOCs, it is obvious that today's students, and students over the next decade, will be taught in ways other than just the familiar professor at the front of a classroom. Already, in the United States, surveys show that 31 percent of current college students are projected to take at least one online course during their college careers.<\/p>\n<p>\"Whether MOOCs find their role or not, it's clear that video and digital delivery of content will become increasingly necessary,\" McCartney says. \"Flipped classrooms, for example, in which students watch a video lecture before coming to class, and then spend class time in hands-on exercises, are being used increasingly across the nation, including in Purdue's IMPACT program. Few universities are ready to deal with that.\"<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Digital scholarship:<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Three emerging tools will be critical to the success of digital scholars, whether they are students, instructors or researchers: Social media; data scholarship, especially the analysis of large data sets, known as \"Big Data\"; and cloud computing. These are already having an effect on how students and faculty conduct their work, and McCartney says universities must do much more to accommodate and support these new tools.<\/p>\n<p>\"Big Data, in particular, has the potential to transform not only the academic disciplines, but also the ways we teach and do research,\" McCartney says. \"I predict that Big Data will be as important and transformational to academia over the next decade as the Internet has been over the past decade.\"<\/p>\n<p>McCartney says the video, \"The New Logistics of Knowledge,\" offers a glimpse at key indicators that will shape higher education in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>\"We don't try to provide solutions, although we do provide examples of what Purdue is doing to address these changes,\" McCartney says. \"But there is much more work to be done at all universities. If the needed changes can be likened to a drive from Chicago to Los Angeles, we're just in Naperville, just in the suburbs. We have a long way to go.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong>    Steve Tally, 765-494-9809, tally@purdue.edu, Twitter: sciencewriter<\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong>    Gerry McCartney, 765-496-2270, mccart@purdue.edu, Twitter: @gerrymccartney <b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>IMAGE CAPTION:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A new Purdue video shows how changes in technology and behavior of U.S. consumers is driving changes in higher education.

This year's fellowship winners are Katie Cahill-Rincón and Emre Gencer. <\/p><p>Cahill-Rincón, a doctoral candidate in political science from Clarkston, Wash., is studying the distribution of social goods, specifically child immunizations, in democratic versus non-democratic nations.<\/p><p>Gencer, a doctoral student in chemical engineering from Istanbul, Turkey, will focus his research on creating a transitional energy source through the combination of currently used fossil fuels and solar energy. <\/p><p>\"Both of these students are great examples of the excellent level of research GPRI was looking for in our first year giving out this fellowship,\" said Dennis Depew, the institute's interim director. \"The innovative ideas they presented combine science and public policy, which is exactly what we wanted to see.\"<\/p><p>Cahill-Rincón's proposal to study distribution of child immunizations fits right into the institute's main mission: to inform policymakers about critical issues such as food security and health, Depew said.<\/p><p>\"Policy is about what governments choose to do and not to do,\" Cahill-Rincón said. \"And part of what I’m examining is what they have chosen to do when it comes to child immunizations.\"<\/p><p>Her project compares the consistency and overall success of child immunizations in India, the largest democracy in the world, with politically unstable countries, such as Bangladesh. She will include those case studies in a larger pool of data from 50 different developing countries. <\/p><p>\"Some nations, like Bangladesh, have chosen to be entrepreneurial and partner with external organizations, while other nations, like India, have made different choices; partly due to concerns about sovereignty. Both of those choices have an important impact on policy outcomes.\"<\/p><p>Cahill-Rincón, who is going to India in June, will examine the widest discrepancies India faces when it comes to child immunization rates across the country. After completing fieldwork in India, Cahill-Rincón will travel to Bangladesh in September.<\/p><p>Gencer is taking a physical rather than social science approach to his project. His research looks at potentially effective methods for prolonging the life span of current energy sources, specifically those used in the transportation sector and electricity generation and heating, by combining them with the most abundant sustainable energy source, solar energy.<\/p><p>\"We need a transition solution,\" Gencer said. \"Now we have fossil fuels, but in 100 years we won't have fossil fuels. If we start using renewable energy, we will extend this period and the transition to using other sources of energy will be more smoother.\"<\/p><p>This fellowship is allowing Gencer to add another layer to his project.<\/p><p>\"We can do optimizations and find new processes, but without the policy aspect it is really hard to express ourselves and show the importance of this project,\" Gencer said. \"So with this fellowship it will be much easier to address these aspects and to reach the right people.\"<\/p><p>The fellowship provides stipends for research-related expenses from May to November of 2013. Cahill-Rincón and Gencer will file reports and policy briefs with GPRI following the conclusion of their research.  <\/p><p>The Global Policy Research Institute enhances the visibility and impact of Purdue University's strengths in policy-related and multidisciplinary research, education, service and outreach to inform decision-makers on global policy issues. <\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/global-policy-research-institute-awards-first-graduate-research-fellowships.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

They also will organize local events, a national briefing, and an online portal to help the public and key stakeholders address these challenges, Burks said.<\/p>\n<p>In return, fellows will learn to apply their expertise more broadly, gain leadership skills, and join a cross-boundary professional community with the drive and talent to tackle society's most complex issues, she said.<\/p>\n<p>\"This will be a great experience for students to gain the depth and breadth for addressing the vexing challenges of our world by working with students in other disciplines and at other universities,\" said Burks, who will receive her doctorate degree in agronomy this spring. \"ELISS Fellows from Purdue will connect with other graduate students who are passionate and driven to find solutions to the great challenges of our world today.\"<\/p>\n<p>Goldner said addressing societal challenges requires collaboration across academic disciplines. But that can be difficult among those who speak in different disciplinary jargon, face institutional barriers and have few professional contacts outside their discipline or region.<\/p>\n<p>\"Not only will the ELISS fellows learn to collaborate more effectively, they will become members of the inaugural class of passionate graduate students empowered and equipped to tackle society's toughest challenges,\" said Goldner, who is receiving his Purdue doctorate degree in earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences this spring.<\/p>\n<p>Purdue participated in a national signature drive sponsored by the AAAS from Oct. 22-Nov. 23, gathering interest from students across all academic disciplines on campus.<\/p>\n<p>Led by Burks, Goldner and Payne, Purdue gathered 156 signatures, finishing third behind the University of Washington (209) and the University of Pennsylvania (170). Invited to join Purdue as founding partners of the ELISS program are Washington, Penn and Stanford University.<\/p>\n<p>\"What's exciting is the strength of our signature drive, which had representation from every college at Purdue - from physics, environmental sciences and agronomy to linguistics and history,\" said Payne, who is pursuing her doctorate degree in ecological sciences and engineering.<\/p>\n<p>Led by AAAS, ELISS unites national leadership and resources with the passion of students from multiple campuses. A group of early-career Ph.D.s with experience in government, industry, and academia founded ELISS. AAAS is a nonprofit organization that reaches 10 million individuals. It draws upon AAAS's experience in leadership development and public engagement, while maintaining the grass-roots, student-driven culture of its founders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer<\/strong>: Phillip Fiorini, 765-496-3133, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/pfiorini@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">pfiorini@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources<\/strong>: Timothy Sands, 765-494-9709, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/tsands@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">tsands@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>            Jennifer Burks, 812-345-2211, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/jlburks@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jlburks@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>              Aaron Goldner, 503-544-7170, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/agoldner@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agoldner@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>              Lindsey Payne, 949-357-4514, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/paynel@purdue.ed\" target=\"_blank\">paynel@purdue.ed<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Related websites:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>American Association for the Advancement of Science: <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.aaas.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.aaas.org/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Purdue Office of Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs: <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.gradschool.purdue.edu/oigp/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gradschool.purdue.edu/oigp/<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/new-purdue-graduate-fellowship-program-designed-to-prepare-interdisciplinary-leaders.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

The program helps meet a need for poultry veterinarians, said Pat Wakenell, associate professor of avian diagnostics at Purdue and co-head of avian diagnostics at the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory.<\/p>\n<p>\"With the rise in popularity of the general public running hobby farms, there is a lack of knowledge and skills needed to address the health and wellness of poultry and other livestock,\" Wakenell said.<\/p>\n<p>She said the program helps provide a solution by integrating poultry medicine into the block schedule for fourth-year doctor of veterinary medicine students. Three 2012 Purdue DVM graduates went on to pursue jobs in the field.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the residency program will provide training in all major areas of an active poultry medicine practice such as diagnostic pathology and farm visits, Wakenell said. It also incorporates a training curriculum designed to lead to board certification in either the American College of Veterinary Pathologists or the American College of Poultry Veterinarians.<\/p>\n<p>Purdue's first resident in the program, Yuko Sato, a 2012 doctor of veterinary medicine graduate, started the program in August 2012 and plans to continue for three years. Wakenell said the program plans to have a second resident start in July.<\/p>\n<p>\"One of the goals is to graduate a poultry veterinarian every year,\" Wakenell said. \"We've had great support from the Indiana State Poultry Association, which is providing financial assistance with travel for residents who are working with clients around the state.

Wiley, president of the Lincoln Leadership Institute at Gettysburg.<\/p>\n<p>\"The Krannert School is producing the next generation of global leaders, and our students have the opportunity to hone their knowledge and leadership skills all over the world,\" says P. Christopher Earley, Krannert dean and James Brooke Henderson Professor of Management. \"It is fitting that students will now have that opportunity at one of the most important historical settings in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>\"While some people have talked about ‘flipping the classroom,' Professor Alge is reinventing it. This unique approach will complement the outstanding classroom and extracurricular educational opportunities currently available to our students.\"<\/p>\n<p> The course, which will be offered for the first time this spring, is graduate level but also open to undergraduates and non-students. The basic course will provide two hours of credit, and will consist of reading and online discussion followed by three days at Gettysburg. For an additional credit hour, students can continue with additional readings and leadership development planning.<\/p>\n<p>\"The knowledge gained through this course will help students lead in stressful, uncertain situations where resources are limited and change is constant.\" Alge said. \"These challenges were present in 1863 and are ubiquitous in most organizations today.\"<\/p>\n<p>At the Lincoln Leadership Institute, a faculty of generals, ambassadors and historians help leaders at all levels of organizations understand how lessons from the Battle of Gettysburg can translate into actions at their companies.<\/p>\n<p>Wiley and his staff use history as a metaphor and the battlefield as a classroom to help students experience how leadership can transform teams and organizations; develop essential communication skills; learn how to think strategically and critically; discover rational and emotional components of being a leader; identify and apply the characteristics of some of history's great leaders; and uncover strategies for selling, leading, negotiating and producing results.<\/p>\n<p>\"We are excited to work with as prestigious an institution as Purdue University and its Krannert School of Management,\" Wiley said. \"The institute has been privileged to work with leaders from the majority of Fortune 100 companies, dozens of federal agencies and more than 75 presidential appointees and their teams. Now we look forward to hosting tomorrow's leaders from Purdue.\"<\/p>\n<p>The class will begin May 13 with departure for Gettysburg on May 14, returning early on May 18. Registration deadline is April 15.<\/p>\n<p>More information on the course and registration are available at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.krannert.purdue.edu/off-campus-credit/lincoln/home.asp\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/off-campus-credit/lincoln/home.asp<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Judith Barra Austin, 765-494-2432, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/jbaustin@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jbaustin@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<strong>Source:<\/strong> Bradley Alge, 765-494-4483, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/algeb@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">algeb@purdue.edu<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/purdue,-lincoln-institute-to-offer-leadership-class-with-gettysburg-component.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

S. Air Force to create a device that blasts balls clean through plywood or aluminum and deeply dents steel. Online video of the bazooka destroying pingpong paddles, VHS tapes and a series of soda pop cans has generated more than a half million views.<\/p>\n<p>Previous devices propelled balls by popping the seal on a vacuum tube. French had his doctoral students Craig Zehrung and Jim Stratton create a pressure chamber connected to the vacuum tube via a convergent-divergent nozzle.<\/p>\n<p>\"That hourglass-shaped nozzle is similar to what is used in fighter jets,\" French said. \"When the pressurized air rushes through the bottleneck it accelerates to supersonic speed as it helps propel the ball through the clear PVC barrel.\"<\/p>\n<p>French says the supersonic speeds are surprising because the lightweight balls have such poor aerodynamics and high-drag coefficient. At a mere 2.3 grams, the balls deliver a startling amount of energy to targets - the equivalent of a 125 mph fastball or a brick falling several stories.<\/p>\n<p>\"There is not enough money you could give me to get me to step in front of that gun,\" French said.<\/p>\n<p>French uses the gun as an educational device for his students in the <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.tech.purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">College of Technology<\/a> and as an outreach tool during demonstrations for a wide variety of schoolchildren.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jim Schenke, 765-237-7296, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/jschenke@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jschenke@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Mark French, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q1/guitar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">guitar@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>VIDEO:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/youtu.be/YYNCGZCul1Q\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/YYNCGZCul1Q<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Embed code: <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/youtu.be/YYNCGZCul1Q\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/YYNCGZCul1Q<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Note to Journalists<\/span><\/b>: Broadcast-quality B-roll, sound bites and package are available.

More than 2,750 students were candidates for degrees.<\/p>\n<p>Sands said the university has a long history - starting from its founding - of rising to the occasion and producing alumni who do the same.<\/p>\n<p>In 1894, he noted, a fire destroyed an early campus landmark. Then-President James Smart declared that Heavilon Hall would be rebuilt - \"One brick higher.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"That phrase continues to define the Boilermaker spirit,\" Sands said. \"Purdue Boilermakers work hard to make things better in the world. They accomplish remarkable feats, sometimes against the odds, and often without precedent.\"<\/p>\n<p>Sands spoke of a long line of Boilermaker accomplishments that had profound world impact: The landing of the Eagle on the moon, an airbus on the Hudson River and a space rover on Mars. He noted the inventors of Fiberglass and Stovetop Stuffing are Purdue graduates, as are the writers of an Academy Award-winning screenplay, best-selling novels and of software called a \"Wiki.\"<\/p>\n<p>Nobel and World Food prize winners, Super Bowl champions and, of course, winners of the Old Oaken Bucket, have come from Purdue.<\/p>\n<p>He noted that Boilermakers have created new drugs for fighting cancer and discovered a new virus that may one day lead to a treatment for tuberculosis, and have become CEOs of international companies, mayors of towns and governors of states across our nation.<\/p>\n<p>\"The accomplishments of our alumni, faculty and staff are as varied as the students sitting in this great hall,\" Sands said. \"But as different as they are, these great deeds have something in common: They all relied on the leadership of a Purdue Boilermaker.\"<\/p>\n<p>The late Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon, was such an example, Sands said.<\/p>\n<p>\"Neil tended to understate his accomplishments. He was a humble man, which made him a great leader,\" Sands said. \"When he returned from his historic moonwalk, Neil talked about helping the needy and feeding millions of hungry people around the world. He said, 'It's going to take an international approach far beyond any cooperative effort ever seen in history. ' \"<\/p>\n<p>Sands said Armstrong had the vision of a great leader because he saw a cause larger than himself and that leadership is about learning how to pull people or ideas together to focus on a clear objective.<\/p>\n<p>\"People become leaders because they want to make something better, just as we once built a building 'one brick higher,'\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Sands wished the graduates \"a safe flight and happy landing,\" as they launch into the next phase of their journeys.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jim Bush, 765-494-2077, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/jsbush@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsbush@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Timothy Sands, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/president@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">president@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/sands-to-graduates-purdue-boilermakers-have-a-history-of-leadership.html\" target=\"_blank\">Link to Acting President Timothy Sands' full speech<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/purdue.photoshelter.com/gallery/Winter-Commencement-2012/G0000SLAybXMOSpg\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Photo gallery of the December 2012 commencement ceremonies<\/strong><\/a><br><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/sands-to-graduates-boilermakers-have-a-history-of-going-one-brick-higher.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Gifts that support faculty go to the heart of our mission.\"<\/p>\n<p>Jeffrey Roberts, the Frederick L. Hovde Dean of the College of Science, said Zoltners' gift will help Purdue attract and retain a professor who excels in mathematics teaching and research.<\/p>\n<p>\"Mathematics is critical not only to the STEM fields for which Purdue is internationally known, but, as Dr. Zoltners' business success illustrates, it also offers the solution to problems across all disciplines,\" he said. \"A distinguished professorship in Dr. Zoltners' name is a fitting way to express pride in our alumnus and gratitude for his history of generosity to the Department of Mathematics and College of Science.\"<\/p>\n<p>Zoltners, of Chicago, applied his mathematics education to solving problems in the sales and marketing industry. He is a prominent author and expert in marketing models and sales force design and co-founder of ZS Associates, a global sales and marketing consulting firm in Chicago.<\/p>\n<p>He earned a master's degree in mathematics from Purdue in 1969 and in 1999 received a distinguished alumni award from the Department of Mathematics.<\/p>\n<p>After graduating from Purdue, Zoltners studied integer-programming algorithms and earned a doctoral degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 1973. In 1983 co-founded ZS Associates. Today ZS Associates has more than 1,000 employees and assists Global 500 companies and industries throughout the world.<\/p>\n<p>Zoltners also is a professor emeritus of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, where he has been a faculty member for more than 30 years. In 2005 Zoltners was inducted into the Chicago Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame.<\/p>\n<p>Zoltners said he has not forgotten the impact Purdue professors had on him and hopes that strong influence and guidance will be retained for future generations of mathematicians.<\/p>\n<p>\"To be competitive in world markets, the U.S. needs to produce the best educated scientists and mathematicians in the world,\" Zoltners said. \"Our universities are still the best in the world at scientific education and research. I am hoping in a small way to continue to build this asset and enhance the leadership.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Faculty Fund for Excellence was established earlier this year to raise private gifts to endow new professorships.

Edwardson Dean of Engineering, said faculty growth hasn't kept up with other growth in the college.<\/p>\n<p>\"From fall 2006 to fall 2011, our undergraduate enrollment grew by 17 percent; our graduate enrollment by 28 percent; and our research enterprise, as measured by annual research expenditures, by 79 percent. During that same time, faculty growth was 6 percent,\" she said. \"As a result, we have developed a five-year plan for strategic growth that will add up to 107 faculty members.\"<\/p>\n<p>That will grow the faculty from the current 358 to 465, a 30 percent increase.<\/p>\n<p>With the additional faculty, undergraduate enrollment will grow by almost 10 percent to more than 7,750 and graduate enrollment will grow by 750 to 3,500.<\/p>\n<p>\"We will help meet the need for more engineers while giving students the education they need to succeed in well-paying and challenging jobs,\" Jamieson said.<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Immelt, chairman and CEO of GE, said there is a need for more engineers.<\/p>\n<p>\"A critical sustainable competitive advantage for a company or a country is its technology base, and I applaud Purdue University and its leadership's commitment to educating more world-class engineers,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>The National Science Foundation says that jobs in engineering and science pay more, even when compared to jobs requiring similar amounts of education and experience. NSF said that half of workers in engineering and science jobs earned at least $73,290 in 2010, more than double the $33,840 median income of the total U.S. workforce.<\/p>\n<p>And those engineers coming out of Purdue will have a world-class education, Jamieson said.<\/p>\n<p>\"Faculty growth of this magnitude has the potential to shape how we educate our students, particularly in developing hands-on, team-oriented classes,\" she said. \"We know from our graduates and from our industry partners that in the real world, engineers work in teams. With a team-based classroom approach  - which a lower faculty-to-student ratio will allow - our graduates are better prepared to make the transition from school to career.\"<\/p>\n<p>The growth also has potential to shape how the college connects with the world through research, engagement, economic development, K-12 outreach, entrepreneurship, partnerships and global activities, Jamieson said.<\/p>\n<p>\"With more research and outreach, Purdue will be able to continue the valuable work it does in addressing the enormous global challenges we face, from cures for diseases to alternative fuels to safer buildings,\" she said.<\/p>\n<p>Jamieson said details on disciplines and areas that would see an increase in the number of faculty are still to be worked out, but two areas seem logical for additions:<\/p>\n<p>* Next May, the college will award its first bachelor's degrees in environmental and ecological engineering. EEE is a division within the College of Engineering, which means it draws faculty from throughout the college.<\/p>\n<p>\"This is a perfect example of how we are merging traditional disciplines with newer ones that tackle modern challenges head on,\" Jamieson said.<\/p>\n<p>She also noted that growth in jobs in environmental and ecological engineering is second only to biomedical engineering.<\/p>\n<p>* The university already is in the process of hiring in the area of integrated imaging, which combines sensor science, information processing and computer systems. The imaging is used in medical diagnosis, remote sensing and nanotechnology, among others. Disciplines involved are electrical and computer engineering, biomedical engineering, biological sciences and chemistry.<\/p>\n<p>\"Hiring a cluster of faculty from the different colleges and schools will pull it all together for advances that can't be done in a single discipline alone,\" Jamieson said.<\/p>\n<p>She said funding for the additional faculty will come from the university provost's office, revenue from a fee that engineering students pay, redirecting funds within the college, and from fund-raising among alumni and friends of the college.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Judith Barra Austin, 765-494-2432, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/jbausitn@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jbausitn@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Leah Jamieson, 765-494-5346, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/lhj@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">lhj@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Note to Journalists<\/span><\/b>: Broadcast reporters interested in a video clip of Dean Leah Jamieson can contact Judith Austin, Purdue News Service, at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/jbaustin@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jbaustin@purdue.edu<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/purdue-to-increase-engineering-faculty-by-a-third.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Games Slayter Distinguished Professor. \"By helping to attract or to retain outstanding faculty, this endowed professorship will positively impact our students in perpetuity.\"<\/p>\n<p>Skidmore earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1954. In 2011 he received the Outstanding Chemical Engineer Award from the School of Chemical Engineering.<\/p>\n<p>After serving as product sales manager with national responsibility for Archer Daniels Midland Co., Skidmore started his own business, Skidmore Enterprises, in 1963, selling machinery, chemicals, instrumentation, starches and soy products to a variety of industries. In 1971, the business became Skidmore Sales and Distributing Co. It is now one of the largest distributors of industrial food ingredients to the food industry with more than 2,000 line items, 150 suppliers and nearly 120 employees.<\/p>\n<p>The Skidmores, now retired, live in Covington, Ky., and Naples, Fla.<\/p>\n<p>\"Purdue was my first and only choice for an engineering education. I was not disappointed,\" Skidmore said. \"The opportunities available to me allowed not only a wonderful professional and technical education, but also the chance to interact with the other students and faculty to develop many of the skills necessary to succeed in the business world. I will always be grateful to Purdue for the fine education and wonderful campus experiences. My wife and I are delighted to have the opportunity to give back to Purdue.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Faculty Fund for Excellence was established earlier this year to raise private gifts that will be matched by up to $7.25 million in university funds designated for faculty investment.<\/p>\n<p>The program is designed to endow new professorships. Named and distinguished professorships offer a way for the university to recognize contributions by faculty to their areas of expertise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Judith Barra Austin, 765-494-2432, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/jbaustin@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jbaustin@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Arvind Varma, 765-494-4075, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/avarma@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">avarma@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/chemical-engineering-alum-to-endow-professorship.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

The division was established five years ago as an independent academic unit within the College of Engineering.<\/p>\n<p>John W. Sutherland, the Fehsenfeld Family Head of EEE, said that until now, students had earned degrees in multidisciplinary engineering. With the approval, 42 students will transition into the new EEE bachelor's degree program. Several additional students are expected to transfer from other programs, bringing the number of EEE majors to more than 50, Sutherland said.<\/p>\n<p>\"The target size for our undergraduate program is 115; we should be producing 35 graduates per year within five to six years,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>\"As a division, we are able to engage faculty from across all of engineering to deliver EEE courses,\" Sutherland said. \"This allows us to draw on broad expertise to address fundamental engineering issues with respect to environmental protection and environmental quality.<\/p>\n<p>\"Our approach is different from many other environmental engineering programs. We don't just focus on pollution control and managing legacy and existing environmental problems,\" he said. \"In addition, we emphasize the need to design engineered systems to proactively prevent future environmental challenges.\"<\/p>\n<p>Sutherland said the demand for students with an environmental and ecological engineering degree is strong; the rate of environmental engineering job growth is the second-highest of all engineering disciplines, lagging only biomedical engineering. He noted that during the recent Industrial Roundtable job fair on campus, the students who are expected to earn EEE degrees in May drew tremendous interest from potential employers. <\/p>\n<p>EEE also is an attractive engineering discipline for young women. The students in the new degree program are 55 percent female. That compares with 2011-12 enrollments of 21 percent female for all of engineering and 42.6 percent female for all of Purdue. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Judith Barra Austin, 765-494-2432, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/Mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/jbaustin@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jbaustin@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> John Sutherland, 765-496-9697, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/Mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/jwsuther@purdue.eud\" target=\"_blank\">jwsuther@purdue.eud<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/purdue-offering-new-degree-in-environmental-and-ecological-engineering.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

The Launching Business Leaders message continues in a second eight-week class that focuses on information literacy, including written and oral communication and research.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, in their junior year, all Krannert students will enroll in an upper-level 16-week course that focuses on personal portfolio assessment, résumé building, interviewing skills and professional behavior and etiquette. The students will use Passport, a tool designed at Purdue by ITaP, which can then be attached to their LinkedIn site.<\/p>\n<p>\"Through these courses, our students will work on various components of professional and personal success, including critical thinking, oral communication, global awareness and networking skills to name a few,\" Sullivan said. \"They'll learn to think and analyze and will leave Purdue with the leadership skills necessary to tackle the toughest challenges.<\/p>\n<p>\"They'll also work to develop their personal brand that includes trustworthiness and integrity, professionalism, personal responsibility and a drive for results.\"<\/p>\n<p>Krannert graduates are highly sought after by job recruiters who ranked Krannert third in a 2012 Bloomberg Businessweek survey of undergraduate business schools.<\/p>\n<p>\"Why shouldn't our students be No. 1?\" asked Sullivan, who said Krannert<a name=\"OLE_LINK2\" id=\"OLE_LINK2\">'<\/a>s new challenge will be to increase the number of community, company, state, local and world leaders who it graduates.<\/p>\n<p>\"We have world-class academic programs at Purdue.

Her proposal for a distance-learning program was intended to correct this by exposing a large number of college science students across many universities to the current state of the research.<\/p>\n<p>Future members of the scientific community are drawn from this pool, so this should result in a greater awareness and representation of this field. Currently, Lelièvre is studying the development and behavior of both normal and cancerous cells, using a three-dimensional culture that permits the architectural mimicry of physiologically relevant tissue.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, this culturing method allows her to study the effect of polarity - the way cells organize themselves to make certain structures face certain directions - on the development of tumors. Her laboratory also examines how the genome of cells is affected by the organization of cell components in the nucleus in relation to tissue architecture.<\/p>\n<p>\"Most of those who study cancer use already-cancerous cells for their research.

Whittaker said students who fulfill the four pillars of 4-3-2-1-Graduate! tend to perform better academically.<\/p>\n<p>\"We were trying to think of how we could increase four-year graduation numbers,\" said Purdue Student Government President Joe Rust. \"This is going to be one of our tools used to increase that rate.\"<\/p>\n<p>4-3-2-1-Graduate! was developed by the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Purdue biomedical engineering major Keith Hansen served as a student ambassador for the Indiana Commission for Higher Education to help promote the need for student success and timely completion, which also plays into 4-3-2-1-Graduate!<\/p>\n<p>Purdue Student Government has since adopted the initiative, further promoting its merits.<\/p>\n<p>\"What you're seeing now is a wholesale launch so that every student will understand it as a recipe for success,\" Whittaker said.<\/p>\n<p>\"It's your goal and the steps you have to take to reach that graduation date and to do it in four years,\" Rust added.<\/p>\n<p>Through dozens of interviews, Rust is working to create a video that will inform students of programs and services available on campus.<\/p>\n<p>\"We want to show that not only are there programs and services on campus that will help them graduate in four years, but we also have so many committed staff, faculty and administrators that really want them to graduate in four years,\" Rust said. \"They're here to help, and we want students to know they can go into their offices and ask for help in the areas that they work in.\"<\/p>\n<p>Rust highlighted the various tutor, supplemental information and undergraduate studies programs as some of the many services available.<\/p>\n<p>All aspects of 4-3-2-1-Graduate! build off one another, Rust said.<\/p>\n<p>\"Students who are more involved on campus tend to be more academically successful,\" he said. \"Students who study more tend to have a higher GPA, and that's an indicator they are successful in the classroom. It all ties together to the idea of graduating in four years.\"<\/p>\n<p>Promoting the need for students to make one leadership commitment goes past the idea of graduating in four years.<\/p>\n<p>\"We want these students in 10 or 15 years to be world changers,\" Whittaker said. \"We only have four short years to build these skills, so this recipe is a simple way to articulate our expectations.\"<\/p>\n<p>Purdue has approximately 1,000 student organizations, Rust noted. The goal of having each student making one leadership commitment does not necessarily entail holding a cabinet position within a group.<\/p>\n<p>\"We want students to come up with a leadership commitment, and maybe that's a commitment to yourself, a commitment to the campus or a commitment to academic success,\" Rust said.<\/p>\n<p>Cameron Brown and Brett Westcott – better known as the Purdue Compliment Guys – exemplified this idea perfectly, Rust said. The students regularly stood on campus and offered compliments to people walking past.<\/p>\n<p>\"They were not involved with a position and not involved with a specific organization,\" he said. \"But they had a leadership commitment to make the campus a happier place. They did what they thought was right and they did what they thought was best.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Brian Peloza, 765-494-2084, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/bpeloza@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">bpeloza@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Dale Whittaker, 765-494-0615, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/dwhittak@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">dwhittak@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Joe Rust, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/rust@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">rust@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/initiative-offers-path-for-students-to-graduate-in-4-years.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

It will be a 48-credit offering that can be completed in three semesters and will include a global and experiential learning component.<br><br>\n\"The new HRM curriculum represents an innovative approach to human resource management,\" said P. Christopher Earley, dean of the Krannert School and James Brooke Henderson Professor of Management. \"It also maintains a tradition within our school that has produced leaders in HR management with a strong business focus for more than three decades.\"<br><br>\nHRM students will complete a management core of business analytics, organizational behavior, managerial communication and employment law. They can select three of six courses in the areas of accounting, finance, marketing, operations, strategic management and economics. The management core is 16 hours, the strongest requirement among peer institutions with similar programs. The human resource core classes will comprise 12 hours.<br><br>\nStudents may choose from a menu of organizational behavior and human resource management electives for six credit hours, and free electives for an additional nine credit hours. The final five credit-hour requirements will be any combination of global experience and/or experiential learning opportunities. Students may spend a module at the GISMA Business School in Hannover, Germany, or participate in one of the international study trips offered around the globe. They also may take part in programs such as Purdue's Experiential Learning Initiative, which allows students to combine prior knowledge and experience with classroom learning and apply it in an active business setting. The projects are executed under faculty supervision.<br><br>\n\"This will offer students the best contemporary combination of human resources and business management training,\" said Brad Alge, associate professor of management and area coordinator in organizational behavior and human resources. \"With a management core, expanded experiential learning and international study options, the Krannert HRM program is now positioned to achieve our vision of leading the human resources marketplace by producing HR-focused, business-savvy leaders for today's global organizations.\"<br><br>\nThe HRM program will begin each August and conclude in December of the next year, giving students the opportunity to do an internship during the summer before the final semester.<br><br>\nThe Purdue MBA, which spans four semesters, still offers options in organizational behavior and human resources for students desiring to take more courses in the management core.<br><strong>     <br>\nWriter:<\/strong> Judith Barra Austin, 765-494-2432, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q2/jbaustin@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jbaustin@purdue.edu<\/a><br><br><strong>Source:<\/strong> Brad Alge, 765-494-4483, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q2/algeb@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">algeb@purdue.edu<br><br><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q2/krannert-to-offer-updated-human-resource-management-program.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

The top 10 public and private \"best values\" are ranked; the rest are listed alphabetically.<br><br>\nIt is the second time this academic year that Purdue has been recognized for being a good value. In August, SmartMoney magazine ranked Purdue seventh nationally in its college \"payback\" survey, which quantified the long-term value of a college degree.<br><br>\n\"This survey is more evidence that Purdue is a tremendous value,\" said Timothy D. Sands, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. \"Our students obtain an excellent education at a reasonable price. That's why we're attracting the best students.\"<br><br>\nSchools on the best value list were selected based on surveys of administrators and students at more than 650 public and private colleges and universities. Selection criteria included more than 30 factors in academics, costs and financial aid.<br><br>\nRobert Franek, Best Value Colleges lead author, told USA Today that value is about more than just \"a low sticker price. The commitment has to be much deeper than that.\"<br><br>\nTuition at Purdue for the 2011-12 academic year is $9,478 for in-state students and $27,646 for out-of-state students. The average SAT score for current Purdue freshmen is 1,325 on the critical reading, math and writing sections.<br><br>\nThe Princeton Review summary says, in part, \"When people think of Purdue University, what usually comes to mind is its outstanding engineering and agricultural programs, but students pursuing other degrees want you to know there are 'many other prestigious majors.' \"<br><br>\n\"Regardless of your major, 'Purdue prepares students to be leaders by helping them grow personally and professionally during their collegiate years through a combination of strong academic programs, leadership opportunities and social activities.' 'It provides one-of-a-kind experiences in research, professors and organizations.' \"<br><br>\nOther universities in the state included in the \"best value\" survey are DePauw University, Hanover College, Indiana University and the University of Notre Dame. In addition to Purdue and Indiana, other Big Ten universities ranked include the University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and Ohio State University.<br>\n     <br>\nWriter: Greg McClure, 765-496-9711, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q1/gmcclure@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">gmcclure@purdue.edu<\/a><br><br>\nSource: Timothy Sands, 765-494-9709, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q1/tsands@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">tsands@purdue.edu<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/c394f62b828ba2ffde33dc6cb63d0e30/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q1/purdue-in-princeton-reviews-top-150-best-value-colleges.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

They also will become more \"label literate\" by learning what terms such as \"reserve\" and \"estate\" on the label mean.<\/p>\n<p>The final installment, Part 10 next week, will help novice wine shoppers know how to properly serve and store wine.<\/p>\n<p>\"We're billing the final parts of the wine series as a two-part guide to wine-buying for the frightened,\" said <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/agcomm/Pages/Profile.aspx?strAlias=nvanhoos&amp;intDirDeptID=3\" target=\"_blank\">Natalie van Hoose<\/a>, writer of the series by the Purdue Department of Agricultural Communication. \"You may feel intimidated by that wall of wines at the supermarket, but you really shouldn't. Just relax and enjoy discovering what you like and just how diverse wines really are. \"<\/p>\n<p>Part 9 includes interviews with Indiana winemakers who welcome all wine drinkers - from the timid beginner to the seasoned pro - into their tasting rooms.<\/p>\n<p>\"One of the great things about an Indiana tasting room is that you have a chance to try a variety of wines in a warm, friendly environment,\" van Hoose said. \"The stuffy, formal atmosphere you might imagine is not the reality in Indiana wineries.

Soybean vein necrosis virus, or SVNV, has now been detected in 16 states across the southern and north-central regions of the United States.<\/p>\n<p>\"This is a new disease, so we're learning about what potential impact it might have on yield,\" said Kiersten Wise, Purdue Extension plant pathologist. \"It's important for growers to be aware of this disease because it can look like many other common diseases that we see in soybean fields.\"<\/p>\n<p>Common diseases such as brown spot, downy mildew and sudden death syndrome can all be mistaken for SVNV, so Wise said it's important for growers to know the difference.<\/p>\n<p>\"We want growers to be aware of what they have in their fields, and also to prevent any unwarranted management if they're trying to manage a different disease,\" she said.<\/p>\n<p>Symptoms of SVNV begin with vein clearing followed by chlorosis, appearing as light green to yellow blotchy patches near the main vein of the leaf. Leaves might appear scorched, and affected leaf tissue might die during late stages of infection.<\/p>\n<p>Tiny, winged insects called thrips transmit the virus from plant to plant. Adult thrips, about one-sixteenth of an inch long, have yellow bodies, dark thoraxes and two black crossbands on their forewings. They feed on plant juices primarily on the undersides of leaves and pollen when flowers are present.<\/p>\n<p>Thrips are in soybean fields every year, and damage from the insects alone is usually insignificant.<\/p>\n<p>Because SVNV is so new to Indiana soybean farmers, Wise said she and her colleagues are studying and monitoring the disease.<\/p>\n<p>\"We're in the record-keeping phase,\" Wise said. \"The incidence of SVNV in soybean fields and the economic impact, if any, on soybean production has not been determined in Indiana.\" <\/p>\n<p>Since SVNV is spread by thrips, she said, it's critical to monitor insect vector populations in the region and state to anticipate future epidemics.<\/p>\n<p>Growers should also pay attention to where they have seen the disease, what soybean varieties it affected, and what management practices were used in the affected fields.<\/p>\n<p>Wise said that a group of Midwestern researchers will undertake studies to understand the virus, how it's transmitted, and help determine if it can cause yield loss. The North Central Soybean Research Program has provided funds to develop Extension documents to help growers understand the disease. These materials will be released this winter. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amanda Gee, 765-494-8402, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/agee@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agee@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Kiersten Wise, 765-496-2170, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/kawise@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kawise@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/plant-pathologist-growers-should-be-aware-of-new-soybean-virus.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

In doing so, the landowner not only ensures the land can never be commercially developed, even if sold, but also receives federal income tax deductions.<\/p>\n<p>\"Conservation easements on farmland are authorized by Indiana law,\" said Gerry Harrison, Purdue Extension agricultural economist. \"The grantee, or charitable entity, has the responsibility under the law to see that the land is not developed for anything other than the landowner's retained purposes: agricultural production and perhaps a homestead.\"<\/p>\n<p>In this type of voluntary agreement, the landowner retains land ownership, while the land trust makes sure that the terms of the conservation easement are followed. Landowners can reserve certain rights in the deed of the agreement, such as building a house or farm facilities - something Harrison said they should be careful to consider.<\/p>\n<p>Landowners considering a conservation easement also should consider a current tax amendment that allows greater-than-normal tax deductions.<\/p>\n<p>\"The gift of a conservation easement provides a federal income tax charitable deduction,\" Harrison said. \"The allowable charitable deduction was expanded by an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code in 2006. That provision was temporary, but has been extended through 2013.\"<\/p>\n<p>The temporary provision allows farmers or ranchers to deduct 100 percent of their contribution base (adjusted gross income computed without any net operating loss carryback to the taxable year) in a given year if at least 50 percent of their income is derived from farming.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a farmer had an adjusted gross income of $100,000 and gave a $90,000 conservation easement, plus $10,000 in other charitable contributions, he or she could deduct the entire $90,000 in the tax year of the donation, as well as the additional $10,000. With a higher value conservation easement, the taxpayer could carry over anything above $100,000 for a maximum of 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>Farming and ranching corporations that donate conservation easements also can qualify for the 100 percent limit.<\/p>\n<p>According to Harrison, ongoing government budget discussions mean the extension of the enhanced deduction for the gift of a conservation easement might or might not be available after 2013.<\/p>\n<p>\"Interested landowners would be wise to consult with an accountant or tax lawyer on how these rules might reduce their federal income tax liability and how future gifts or inheritance of the land with a conservation easement might reduce values for lifetime gifts and the federal estate tax,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Even if the enhanced deduction provision is not extended beyond the end of the year, Harrison said, gifting a conservation easement still has tax benefits.<\/p>\n<p>But the process of gifting development rights doesn't come without some initial costs.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the landowner would be responsible for the cost of a professional appraisal to determine the fair market value minus the agricultural value of the parcel of land. The difference is the value of the conservation easement.<\/p>\n<p>\"Costs involved include the appraisal and the service fee paid to the entity that takes the easement,\" Harrison said. \"These costs should be easily offset by the income tax savings from the charitable tax deduction of the value of the easement.\"<\/p>\n<p>Harrison said landowners interested in pursuing a conservation easement agreement should consult a lawyer because the deed over development rights is a legal document.<\/p>\n<p>More information about conservation easements is available in the following publications:<\/p>\n<p>* <i>Conservation Easements in Indiana<\/i> (ID-231) by Harrison.<\/p>\n<p><i>* Tax Treatment of Conservation Easements<\/i> (ID-275) by Bill Hoover, Purdue University professor of natural resources and social science.<\/p>\n<p>Both publications can be downloaded for free in Purdue Extension's The Education Store at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.the-education-store.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.the-education-store.com/<\/a> by searching their ID numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Harrison also can provide additional information at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/harrisog@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">harrisog@purdue.edu<\/a> or 765-494-4216. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jennifer Stewart, 765-494-6682, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/jsstewar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsstewar@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Gerry Harrison, 765-494-4216, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/harrisog@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">harrisog@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/conservation-easements-preserve-land-for-agriculture.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Nitrogen fertilizer rates also influence how much of these nutrients are stored in the grain at harvest.<\/p>\n<p>Growers may need to use fertilizers to meet the increased micronutrient requirements of hybrid corn in high-yield systems, especially if soil nutrient levels are too low.<\/p>\n<p>\"This study raises the question of whether we need to pay more attention to micronutrients in fertilizer management,\" said <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/agry/directory/Pages/tvyn.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Vyn<\/a>, Purdue professor of agronomy and co-author of the study. \"In high-yield systems, it's not just that corn requires more macronutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus - which is what farmers normally think about - more micronutrients are needed as well. If you have soil that is deficient in micronutrients, you could be limiting your yields.\"<\/p>\n<p>Though micronutrients are essential for optimum plant growth and reproductive development, current management practices rarely take them into account, as growers often assume that soil nutrient concentrations for these nutrients are adequate. But in modern crop production systems, deficiencies could occur, Vyn said.<\/p>\n<p>\"For many years, we didn't have to worry about micronutrients,\" he said. \"But if you're in a cash crop situation where you're producing bigger plants and more grain, you are exporting more micronutrients away from the field at harvest. If you're not replacing them, the soil is going to be depleted over time.\"<\/p>\n<p>Soil factors such as pH and moisture can also influence micronutrient availability, said <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agronomy.k-state.edu/p.aspx?tabid=407&amp;ItemID=1284&amp;mid=1679&amp;staff_category=Faculty\" target=\"_blank\">Ignacio Ciampitti<\/a>, co-author of the study and assistant professor at Kansas State University.<\/p>\n<p>“Nutrient availability is more complex than soil nutrient concentrations,\" Ciampitti said. \"Nutrient availability is also related to the plant's ability to take up each nutrient at the soil-root interface.”<\/p>\n<p>In the second part of a study on how modern corn hybrids (post-1990) absorb and allocate nutrients under contemporary management practices, Vyn and Ciampitti measured how simultaneous increases in the number of plants per acre and nitrogen rates affected the concentration of zinc, copper, iron and manganese in two hybrids of corn.<\/p>\n<p>Vyn said the influence of plant density on the uptake of micronutrients was relatively minor, even at high crowding levels, in that higher plant density resulted in similar yields as medium and low densities. But as nitrogen rates increased, yields rose and corn plants took up a substantially greater amount of micronutrients and allocated more micronutrients to the ears.<\/p>\n<p>\"From a human nutrition viewpoint, there's always a concern that increasing yields will dilute the nutritional quality of corn,\" Vyn said. \"But as long as soil concentrations of nutrients are sufficient, higher yields tend to mean more micronutrients are concentrated in the grain, not less.\"<\/p>\n<p>But higher corn yields mean more micronutrients leave the field at harvest.<\/p>\n<p>\"Growers are not used to thinking about how much zinc leaves the field when they harvest grain corn,\" Vyn said. \"But that's part of the management equation that has to be considered.\"<\/p>\n<p>At high plant density (42,000 plants per acre) and high nitrogen rates (200 pounds per acre), 58 percent of zinc taken up by corn hybrids was removed in the grain, compared with 31 percent of copper, 18 percent of iron and 15 percent of manganese.<\/p>\n<p>Vyn and Ciampitti also observed differences in when micronutrients are absorbed and where they are stored in the corn plant. Zinc is taken up throughout the season and is primarily stored in the stems during the vegetative stage, while iron is allocated to the leaves. Copper and manganese are distributed to both leaves and stems and are taken up mostly before the flowering period.<\/p>\n<p>To prevent deficiencies, Vyn suggests growers add zinc to bulk fertilizer with phosphorus - which has a similar uptake pattern - or put it in a starter, while manganese can be supplied in a foliar application where necessary. Growers usually can rely on soil for sufficient levels of iron and copper, he said. <ins cite=\"mailto:Natalie%20van%20Hoose%20\" datetime=\"2013-10-16T14:00\"><\/ins><\/p>\n<p>Further research will concentrate on developing estimates for micronutrient requirements to help inform growers which kinds of fertilizers to apply and when.<\/p>\n<p>\"There's no question that when you have more biomass and higher grain yields, you require more of certain micronutrients,\" Vyn said. \"It's something to be aware of.\"<\/p>\n<p>Funding for the study was provided by Dow AgroSciences, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Purdue Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship, Potash Corp. and The Mosaic Co.<\/p>\n<p>The study was published in <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/www.agronomy.org/publications/aj\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Agronomy Journal<\/i><\/a> and can be viewed online at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/tocs/105/6\" target=\"_blank\">https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/tocs/105/6<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong>  Natalie van Hoose, 765-496-2050, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/nvanhoos@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">nvanhoos@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources<\/strong>: Tony Vyn, 765-496-3757, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/tvyn@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">tvyn@purdue.edu<\/a> <ins cite=\"mailto:Natalie%20van%20Hoose%20\" datetime=\"2013-10-28T07:50\"><\/ins><\/p>\n<p>Ignacio Ciampitti, 785-410-9354, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/Ciampitti@ksu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Ciampitti@ksu.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><b>Related links:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q2/nitrogen-key-to-uptake-of-other-corn-nutrients,-study-shows.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nitrogen key to uptake of other corn nutrients, study shows<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Related website<\/b>:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/agry/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue University Department of Agronomy<\/a><\/p>\n<hr><p><strong>ABSTRACT<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>\n<p><b>Maize Nutrient Accumulation and Partitioning in Response to Plant Density and Nitrogen Rate: II.

Little is known about management-induced changes in plant uptake or allocation of nutrients other than macronutrients. Therefore, impacts of both PD and N rate at three levels (low, medium, and high) on Ca, Mg, and micronutrient partitioning (for pertinent plant organs at six growth stages) were investigated at four environments in Indiana. Grain Ca, Mg, Fe, and Zn contents at maturity were primarily influenced by N rate, while the PD × N rate interaction influenced those of Mn and Cu. At the whole-plant scale, PD and N rate significantly influenced all nutrient contents, and vegetative-stage nutrient accumulation averaged 91% (Ca), 51% (Fe), 47% (Zn), and 73% (Mn, Mg, and Cu) of corresponding nutrient contents at maturity. During the vegetative phase, three modes of leaf vs. stem nutrient partitioning were: (i) preferential allocation of Mg and Zn to stems; (ii) preferential allocation of Fe and Ca to leaves; and (iii) isometric partitioning of Cu and Mn. Isometric nutrient concentration patterns between Mg and Zn were documented in leaf, stem (vegetative phase), and ear (reproductive phase). Early-reproductive-stage nutrient partitioning from plant to ear was greatest for Zn and Mg and mirrored their respective harvest indices (HI) at maturity. Nutrient HIs, concentrations (grain + stover), and internal efficiencies at maturity were positively impacted by N rate but negatively by PD. Reliable micronutrient requirement estimations for maize under diverse management and yield levels help inform future balanced-nutrient input decisions.<\/p>\n<hr><p align=\"left\"><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/high-nitrogen-rates-increase-micronutrient-uptake,-storage-in-corn.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

That represents the largest underutilization of the state's grain storage capacity since the 1988 drought.<\/p>\n<p>\"The annual value of the Indiana grain industry at the farm level is nearly $10 billion, so to not use 30 percent of the capacity had considerable economic impacts across rural communities in terms of lost jobs and reduced hours for workers,\" said Chris Hurt, Purdue Extension agricultural economist.<\/p>\n<p>Grain storage is a fixed capacity, meaning the associated costs continue even if there isn't enough grain production to use it all. That capacity has to be in place for high-production years, but in low-production years similar to 2012, it comes with continuing costs and no returns.<\/p>\n<p>The economic implications weren't limited to just grain storage, though. Processors of biofuels, food, animal feed and other products made from corn and soybeans also slowed production because of a lack of grain and extremely high prices for grain that was available.<\/p>\n<p>\"Indiana is a major grain processing state, so those industries are now returning that idled capacity to work after periods of shutdown in the past year,\" Hurt said.<\/p>\n<p>The drivers behind that return to work are a corn crop that's expected to be near a record-high 1 billion bushels this year and near-normal soybean production around 250 million bushels.<\/p>\n<p>Hurt said the combination of the two crops will use nearly all of the state's storage space.<\/p>\n<p>\"We expect about a 5 percent underutilization, and it turns out that over the last several decades, that's been about normal,\" he said. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jennifer Stewart, 765-494-6682, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/jsstewar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsstewar@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Chris Hurt, 765-494-4273, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/hurtc@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">hurtc@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>VIDEO:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A link to a video clip of Purdue University agricultural economist Chris Hurt talking about how this year's crops will produce more business for the grain-handling industry following last year's drought is available at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3YqR_p1yWE&amp;feature=youtu.be/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3YqR_p1yWE&amp;feature=youtu.be\\<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>EMBED CODE:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&lt;iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_3YqR_p1yWE?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722 <br><br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a> <!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/hurt-higher-corn,-soybean-yields-put-indiana-grain-industry-back-to-work.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Capacity is a fixed cost that doesn't go away with limited cattle supplies.<\/p>\n<p>\"The combination of excess capacity and high fixed costs means that both will tend to bid strongly for the limited cattle numbers,\" Hurt said. \"Ultimately, this strong bidding gets back to the brood cow producer in the form of record-high calf and feeder cattle prices.<\/p>\n<p>\"Unfortunately, these conditions also mean that the margins for both packers and feedlots, while better than in the past year, will still be narrow and likely less than their total costs.\"<\/p>\n<p>Strong cattle prices and aggressive bidding by feedlots and packers are likely to lead to a year or more of additional downsizing.<\/p>\n<p>Some cattle producers in areas with healthy pastures could start retaining heifers as early as this fall. But in dry regions, which represent about 45 percent of the brood-cow herd, expansion won't begin until weather becomes more favorable and pastures recover.<\/p>\n<p>\"If beef cow numbers begin to slowly turn upward in 2014, downsizing of cattle feeding capacity might end in 2015 and the packing industry by 2016,\" Hurt said. \"The years beyond 2016 should provide some expansion for the beef cattle industry, but still a slow upward growth.<\/p>\n<p>\"A slow upward trend is not highly optimistic, but much better than declining trends of recent years.\"<\/p>\n<p>Hurt offers more commentary on the beef cattle outlook in the Oct. 21 <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/farmdoc.illinois.edu/marketing/newsletters.html\" target=\"_blank\">Weekly Outlook<\/a> on the University of Illinois Extension's <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/farmdoc.illinois.edu/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Farmdoc<\/a> website.

That includes drying corn to a safer moisture level when it comes out of the field and then properly cleaning, loading, aerating and monitoring it.<\/p>\n<p>\"This will require adequately drying to 14 to 14.5 percent for long-term storage,\" Klein Ileleji said. \"Think of grain in the bin as cash in the bank. Without good management, this cash can go out of condition, quickly eroding your investment.\"<\/p>\n<p>Ileleji offered some tips for farmers to keep their grain in top shape:<\/p>\n<p>* Sanitation: Growers need to remove all of the food sources and harboring spots for rodents and insects around their storage facilities. This includes cleaning up grain spills and mowing surrounding vegetation. It also means cleaning handling equipment, including augers, cleaners and dryers, at the end of each use.<\/p>\n<p>* Loading: When grain is being loaded into a bin, farmers need to use loading methods that minimize broken kernels and fine material and remove foreign material. Leaving broken kernels, fines and foreign material can make stored grain more susceptible to insect infestation, mold and spoilage because it reduces initial grain quality and aeration efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>According to Purdue Extension's Agricultural Safety Program, out-of-condition grain is the most frequent cause of grain entrapments and engulfment.<\/p>\n<p>\"Cleaning grain and coring the bin to remove fines, leveling binned grain and using appropriate drying and handling methods all reduce broken kernels and fines, and reduce the chance you will need to enter the bin when you unload the grain,\" Ileleji said.<\/p>\n<p>* Aeration: This is the method of cooling grain with ambient air after drying it to decrease insect activity and mold development. Growers need to run bin fans to reduce grain temperature to below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and maintain cool temperatures into the late spring and summer. Using exhaust vents also will help control condensation on the inside roof and headspace walls of grain bins.<\/p>\n<p>* Monitor: Farmers need to monitor their stored grain at a frequency determined by the initial grain quality, moisture content, temperature and whether there has been extreme weather. The higher the ambient temperature, the more frequently bins should be checked. In fall, spring and summer, they need to be checked every 1-2 weeks. In winter, that can be reduced to once a month.<\/p>\n<p>When checking stored grain, growers with temperature cables should monitor for gradual temperature increases over time, rather than absolute temperature. If there are no temperature cables or CO<sub>2<\/sub> sensors available, Ileleji said the smell of spoilage when fans are running is a good indicator that there's a problem.<\/p>\n<p>\"Keep detailed records with dates and what was monitored,\" he said. \"Remember, it is the trends in data that help diagnose a problem and not the data collected at a given time.\"<\/p>\n<p>Purdue Extension offers a grain management bulletin through <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.the-education-store.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Education Store<\/a>.

The perennial plant requires a higher soil pH, ranging from 6.6 to 7.2, than most other forages and agronomic crops. Because changing soil pH can take time, Keith Johnson said producers should look at their alfalfa stands now to see if they are adequate or if new seeding should be planned in the spring of 2014.<\/p>\n<p>\"Producers should evaluate the density of the stand and determine if soil fertility, diseases, too frequent harvest or other stresses might be the reason for the decline,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, alfalfa plant density naturally lessens. Thickening a stand is difficult because alfalfa does not readily reseed itself, and over seeding is not successful because of competition with existing plants and autotoxicity - a process in which established alfalfa produces a chemical that can reduce establishment and growth of new plants.<\/p>\n<p>According to Purdue University research, a satisfactory population is approximately 35 well-growing stems per square foot. Knowing the plant density gives producers a benchmark to measure how well their alfalfa is doing.<\/p>\n<p>\"If the stand is thin, it may be wise to consider establishing a new field in 2014,\" Johnson said.<\/p>\n<p>When choosing a new field location, growers need to remember that alfalfa prefers a well-drained and deep soil. They also need to review labels of herbicides used in fields in 2013 for the plant-back restriction for alfalfa.<\/p>\n<p>Something else Johnson said growers should consider is soil testing.<\/p>\n<p>\"If a soil test has not been taken in the past couple of years it would be advised to get one taken immediately,\" he said. \"If soil pH is low, growers should follow through with limestone application yet this fall. Soil pH change is not immediate after limestone application, so getting it applied at least six months in advance of seeding is best.\"<\/p>\n<p>Information about alfalfa production is available in Purdue Extension's <i>Forage Field Guide<\/i>.

The disease largely was held in check, however, when the weather turned dry.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers should not have a problem finding good-quality Indiana pumpkins. Egel said that when picking out a pumpkin, shoppers should look for one that doesn't have any soft spots, which could lead to rot. They can do that by running their hands over the pumpkin to feel for them.<\/p>\n<p>A healthy pumpkin's stem should be as thick and green as possible, rather than thin and brown. A green stem indicates a fresher pumpkin; a brown stem indicates the pumpkin was harvested too long ago.<\/p>\n<p>\"All pumpkins are unique,\" Egel said. \"Don't be afraid to buy a pumpkin with an odd shape or bumpy exterior.

The Obama administration has mandated that the direct results of federally funded scientific research be made available to the public digitally. That would promote greater and easier access to data that could be used to help drive innovative breakthroughs in areas including health, energy, the environment, national security and agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>The workshop attracted scientists, librarians, modelers, educators, publishers, leaders of professional societies and partners from the private sector.

Participants focused on identifying the key challenges and opportunities from their perspectives.<\/p>\n<p>\"The workshop format was designed to brainstorm, identify and foster beneficial linkages toward the broad goal of developing a functional data infrastructure for agriculture,\" Brouder said. \"We want to make research data useful to the agricultural community and policymakers. This infrastructure is critically necessary.\"<\/p>\n<p>Open access to agricultural data also could be used in education to help graduate students better interpret and present data, Brouder said.<\/p>\n<p>Brouder likened the need for greater access to agricultural research data to how the medical profession has used findings from numerous studies conducted over many years to help people determine whether and when they should be screened for breast cancer and prostate cancer. She said data from her research on crop nitrogen responses could be repurposed to enable modelers to project how nitrogen applications would affect the environment of an entire watershed without conducting a full series of their own field experiments.<\/p>\n<p>\"The theory is that my data is more useful in aggregate with your data rather than as stand-alone,\" Brouder said. \"Traditionally, data in agricultural research have no purpose beyond the current research. But it really does have value beyond that one experiment.\"<\/p>\n<p>She also said the agriculture industry today would know much more about carbon loss from soil if data from experiments decades ago had been preserved.<\/p>\n<p>\"If we had kept certain benchmark pieces of data, we would have had that historical data context in which to conduct our experiments today,\" she said.<\/p>\n<p>There are many issues to resolve, such as determining ownership of the information and where it would be stored - with so much data to preserve, multiple sites most likely would be needed - and developing a \"common language\" for data. Brouder noted that even a seemingly simple term as \"yield\" would need precise definition so the data could be analyzed correctly. Farmers, she explained, typically refer to corn yield with the grain having 15.5 percent moisture content, while modelers predicting global yields perform their calculations presuming grain contains no moisture.<\/p>\n<p>\"If we are going to move to open-access data in a meaningful way, we need to label the data in a meaningful, standardized way,\" she said.<\/p>\n<p>A statement on the challenges and opportunities from the perspectives of workshop participants is being composed. It will help with the development of data infrastructure for the Purdue College of Agriculture's <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/purdue-ag-to-receive-major-funding-for-plant-sciences.html\" target=\"_blank\">plant sciences initiative<\/a>, announced in September, as well as ongoing initiatives nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>More information from the workshop is available on the Smarter Agriculture website at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/arp/Pages/smarteragriculture.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://ag.purdue.edu/arp/Pages/smarteragriculture.aspx<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Keith Robinson, 765-494-2722, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Sylvie Brouder, 765-496-1489, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/sbrouder@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">sbrouder@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><b>Related websites:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/agry\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue Department of Agronomy<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.lib.purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue University Libraries<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/purdue-team-heading-effort-to-create-ag-research-data-system.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Although many foodborne illnesses have declined in the past 15 years, the number of laboratory-confirmed salmonella cases did not change significantly in 2012 compared with 2006 to 2008.<\/p>\n<p>The first step in detecting foodborne pathogens is concentrating the number of cells in test samples. The new system enables researchers to carry out the concentration step within one hour, compared to a day for the standard method now in commercial use, said Ladisch, also a professor of biomedical engineering and director of Purdue's Laboratory of Renewable Resources Engineering (LORRE)<\/p>\n<p>Findings are detailed in a research paper to appear in November in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology.<\/p>\n<p>The paper was authored by doctoral student Xuan Li; LORRE research scientist Eduardo Ximenes; postdoctoral research associate Mary Anne Roshni Amalaradjou; undergraduate student Hunter B. Vibbert; senior research engineer Kirk Foster; engineering resources manager Jim Jones; microbiologist Xingya Liu; Arun K. Bhunia, a professor of food microbiology; and Ladisch.<\/p>\n<p>Findings showed the system was able to concentrate inoculated salmonella by 500 to 1,000 times the original concentration in test samples. This level of concentration is required for accurate detection. Another finding showed the system recovered 70 percent of the living pathogen cells in samples, Ladisch said.<\/p>\n<p>\"This is important because if you filter microorganisms and kill them in the process that's self-defeating,\" he said. \"The goal is to find out how many living microorganisms are present.\"<\/p>\n<p>The machine was used to concentrate cells in a sample of chicken meat. The sample is first broken down into the consistency of a milkshake and chemically pretreated to prevent the filtering membranes from clogging. The fluid is then passed through 12 hollow-fiber filters about 300 microns in diameter that are contained in a tube about the size of a cocktail straw. The filtering process continues until pathogens if present are concentrated enough to be detected.<\/p>\n<p>The technique, developed by researchers from Purdue's colleges of Engineering and Agriculture, could be performed during food processing or vegetable washing before the products are shipped.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture will test the system, which is not yet ready for commercialization.<\/p>\n<p>One feature that could make the machine practical for commercial application is that it can be quickly cleaned between uses. The tubes are flushed with sodium hydroxide and alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>Purdue has filed a patent application for the concept.<\/p>\n<p>The research is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Purdue's Agricultural Research Programs and Center for Food Safety Engineering, and the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Emil Venere, 765-494-4709, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/venere@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">venere@purdue.edu<\/a>   <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Michael Ladisch, 765-494-7022, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/ladisch@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">ladisch@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><b>Note to Journalists<\/b>: An electronic copy of the research paper is available from Emil Venere, 765-494-4709, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/venere@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">venere@purdue.edu<\/a>   <\/p>\n<hr><p><strong>ABSTRACT<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Rapid Sample Processing for Detection of Food-Borne Pathogens via Cross-Flow Microﬁltration<\/strong>    <\/p>\n<p><em>Xuan Li,<sup>a,b<\/sup> Eduardo Ximenes,<sup>a,b<\/sup> Mary Anne Roshni Amalaradjou,<sup>d<\/sup> Hunter B.

This approach includes biochemical pretreatment and preﬁltration of food samples and development of an automated cell concentration instrument based on cross-ﬂow microﬁltration. A polysulfone hollow-ﬁber membrane module having a nominal pore size of 0.2 ��m constitutes the core of the cell concentration instrument. The aqueous chicken homogenate samples were circulated within the cross-ﬂow system achieving 500- to 1,000-fold concentration of inoculated Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and naturally occurring microbiota with 70% recovery of viable cells as determined by plate counting and quantitative PCR (qPCR) within 35 to 45 min. These steps enabled 10 CFU/ml microorganisms in chicken homogenates or 102 CFU/g chicken to be quantiﬁed. Cleaning and sterilizing the instrument and membrane module by stepwise hydraulic and chemical cleaning (sodium hydroxide and ethanol) enabled reuse of the membrane 15 times before replacement. This approach begins to address the critical need for the food industry for detecting food pathogens within 6 h or less. <\/p>\n<hr><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/device-speeds-concentration-step-in-food-pathogen-detection.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

With a large-yielding corn crop expected this year, feed prices have been decreasing, which has turned around the outlook for hog profits.<\/p>\n<p>\"This year, the hog outlook is almost the opposite of what it was last year,\" Hurt said. \"Feed prices, especially corn, have been falling sharply. The hog outlook is profitable, so producers are more likely to be retaining or building the breeding herd and weights are expected to increase as producers hold onto market hogs longer to gain profits on every pound.\"<\/p>\n<p>The most recent hog numbers available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, from the September <i>Hogs and Pigs Report<\/i>, showed that hog inventories are unchanged to somewhat larger compared to a year ago.<\/p>\n<p>\"Yet slaughter in recent weeks has been very low, seemingly indicating a divergence from USDA's reading,\" Hurt said.<\/p>\n<p>Between mid-August and the end of September, slaughter rates dropped by an average of more than 5 percent and weekly slaughter rates have been down anywhere from 3 to 10 percent.<\/p>\n<p>One explanation for the perceived difference in USDA's inventory numbers and slaughter rates could be related to animal deaths from the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or PEDV. The USDA doesn't track PEDV deaths, so Hurt said those numbers aren't known for certain and it could be several months before hog markets are able to sort out the effects of the virus.<\/p>\n<p>Another explanation for seemingly low slaughter rates could be attributed to the way the industry and markets evaluate herd numbers with year-to-year comparisons. Hogs went to market at higher-than-normal rates in 2012 because high feed prices meant the cost of production was higher than producers could sustain.<\/p>\n<p>\"What is being viewed as a very low slaughter in recent weeks might be due to an aberration in the slaughter numbers a year ago,\" Hurt said. \"The unusually high slaughter in the late-summer of 2012 was being driven by the drought. Record-high feed prices and large anticipated losses provided a grave outlook for the industry, and some producers began to adjust.\"<\/p>\n<p>Those adjustments included an increase in sow slaughter and, in some cases, total-herd liquidation a year ago. Now that the outlook has improved, breeding herd expansion has likely started and hogs are being held to higher weights. These factors mean that fewer animals are headed to market right now and prices have strengthened.<\/p>\n<p>\"Given low slaughter numbers, cash prices of hogs have been sharply higher than in the same period in 2012 when they averaged $55 per live hundredweight,\" Hurt said. \"With lower slaughter this year, they have averaged about $68 since mid-August.\"<\/p>\n<p>Higher cash hog prices combined with lower feed costs are the important drivers for a profitable outlook over the next 12 months. Hurt said eastern Corn Belt live-hog prices are expected to average in the mid-$60s in the final quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. Spring and summer prices are expected to move slightly higher.<\/p>\n<p>With the cost of production estimated at $57 per hundredweight, Hurt said cash prices in the mid- to high-$60s would mean profits of more than $20 per head.<\/p>\n<p>\"These profits will enable producers to recover losses of about the same amount in the past year due to the drought,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jennifer Stewart, 765-494-6682, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/jsstewar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsstewar@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Chris Hurt, 765-494-4273, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/hurtc@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">hurtc@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/hurt-falling-feed-prices-to-push-hogs-back-to-profitable.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

The remobilization not only weakened stalks, but it also made them susceptible to stalk rots. Weak and rotten stalks are prone to lodging, which can make picking up grain with a combine difficult and ultimately lead to yield loss.<\/p>\n<p>\"There are a lot of fields vulnerable to storms, so growers need to prioritize the health of their fields for harvest,\" Nielsen said. \"When we start harvesting corn in earnest, we need to get the weakest fields out the earliest.\"<\/p>\n<p>While stalk breakage is easily seen when scouting fields, identifying stalks prone to lodging can be harder. The best way to identify compromised stalks is to pinch the lower stalk internodes to see if they collapse from the pressure.<\/p>\n<p>In some instances, Nielsen said pushing stalks out of the way when scouting is enough to make weak stalks fall over.<\/p>\n<p>\"Fields and hybrids at high risk of stalk breakage should be harvested as early as possible to minimize the risk of significant mechanical harvest losses,\" he said. \"Recognize that hybrids can vary greatly for late-season stalk quality, even if grown in the same field, due to inherent differences for late-season plant health or resistance against carbohydrate remobilization when stressed during grainfill.\"<\/p>\n<p>Stalk rots can get bad enough in some fields to spread to the ear shank, where the ear connects to the stalk, and on into the cob. Shank and cob rots can cause plants to start dropping their ears either spontaneously or when bumped by a combine head.<\/p>\n<p>Part of prioritizing the least healthy fields for earliest harvest also means growers might not want to wait until grain dries down to 18 percent - the desired moisture percentage for harvest.<\/p>\n<p>\"This is not the year to let corn dry down further in the field,\" Nielsen said. \"Get it out of the fields. Don't be greedy about waiting to get this corn down from 22 percent to 18 percent. You're rolling the dice on some of these fields.<\/p>\n<p>\"If a storm comes along, we're not talking about leaning corn. We're talking about corn flat on its face.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jennifer Stewart, 765-494-6682, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/jsstewar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsstewar@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Bob Nielsen, 765-494-4802, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/rnielsen@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">rnielsen@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/poor-stalk-health-means-corn-growers-need-to-prioritize-harvest.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

The oil and gas are produced by injecting chemicals, water and sand into the shale rock at high pressure, thereby fracturing the shale rock to release the oil and gas, which is then brought to the surface.<\/p>\n<p>The report summarizes two papers - one examining the shale oil and gas boom and the other analyzing potential ramifications of significant exports of natural gas - by three researchers in the Department of Agricultural Economics, including assistant professor Farzad Taheripour, who was the lead author, and postdoctoral associate Kemal Sarica. The papers were presented in July at the annual North American joint conference of the United States and International Associations for Energy Economics in Anchorage, Alaska. Paper summaries now have been made public.<\/p>\n<p>\"Our results indicate that the shale oil and gas boom should have a major impact on the U.S. economy,\" the researchers say, with the nation's gross domestic product from 2008 to 2035 averaging 2.2 percent higher than its 2007 level. Without the expansion in production from shale, the GDP - the value of all of the nation's goods and services - would average 1.3 percent lower.<\/p>\n<p>\"That means that U.S. GDP over the entire period of 2008-2035 on average would be 3.5 percent higher each year than it would have been without the shale boom.\" That amounts to an average of $473 billion per year added to the economy during the period.<\/p>\n<p>Restricting gas exports increases the magnitude of the annual gains to $487 billion, according to the report.<\/p>\n<p>The shale boom has other benefits to the economy, including substantially increasing employment and reducing oil and natural-gas prices, the report states. On average each year from 2008 to 2035, oil prices would be 7 percent lower and gas prices 12 percent lower than they would have been without the increased production.<\/p>\n<p>Further, if gas exports are restricted, prices of natural gas would drop by 24.1 percent and the economy would gain $13.3 billion, according to the report. That pales in comparison to a U.S. economy of $15 trillion, the report notes, but the analysis shows that restricting the exports \"provides a small but positive benefit.\"<\/p>\n<p>The report points out that exporting natural gas is economically attractive to the industry because U.S. prices currently are as little as one-fifth the prices in foreign markets. There would be considerable profit to be made even considering the cost of liquefying the gas and shipping it.<\/p>\n<p>\"On the other side, there is potentially large domestic demand for natural gas in electricity generation, industrial applications, the transportation sector and for other uses,\" the researchers say. \"Thus, the question is which pathway provides the best economic and environmental outcome for the U.S.\"<\/p>\n<p>Permitting major exports of natural gas would result in losses in labor and capital income in all energy-intensive sectors and increases in electricity prices, according to the report.<\/p>\n<p>\"The bottom line is that caution is in order in approving large levels of exports,\" the researchers say.<\/p>\n<p>The report summaries are available online at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/dialogue.usaee.org/index.php/assessment-of-the-economic-impacts-of-the-shale-oil-and-gas-boom\" target=\"_blank\">http://dialogue.usaee.org/index.php/assessment-of-the-economic-impacts-of-the-shale-oil-and-gas-boom<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Keith Robinson, 765-494-2722, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Wally Tyner, 765-494-0199, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/wtyner@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">wtyner@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Farzad Taheriour, 765-494-4612 <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/tfarzad@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">tfarzad@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><b>Related website:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/agecon\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue Department of Agricultural Economics<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/purdue-study-shale-oil-and-gas-a-long-term-boon-to-economy.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

It can be identified by its finely divided, toothed leaves and white flowers. Its stems are hairless, have purple spots or blotches and can grow to 2-7 feet in height.<\/p>\n<p>\"The weed seems to be spreading, becoming a more common occurrence in pastures, agronomic crops, fencerows and roadsides,\" Bill Johnson said. \"It can be difficult to control in the spring. It's easier to control in the fall because it's more sensitive to herbicides.\"<\/p>\n<p>The plant growth and appearance is more visible in the spring, when the plants \"bolt\" or elongate rapidly and the white flowers bloom, so that's when most people become concerned with it. But Johnson said there is active rosette formation of the weed in the fall.<\/p>\n<p>\"Growers should really think about fall-applied herbicide treatments whether they're treating their pastures or fields going to corn or soybeans next year,\" he said. \"They should be treating them in the fall to control poison hemlock.\"<\/p>\n<p>For control in grass pastures, he recommended using one of a couple of herbicides that contain triclopyr as an active ingredient.<\/p>\n<p>The good news for livestock producers is that while poison hemlock is considered to be most toxic in the fall, livestock usually won't eat the plant if there are other options in the pasture.<\/p>\n<p>\"Cows won't usually eat poison hemlock because this weed doesn't taste as good as the more desirable pasture species,\" Johnson said. \"But if the pasture is limited in desirable forages, then there may be a situation where the cows will get hungry enough to eat the plant.\"<\/p>\n<p>In corn or soybeans where poison hemlock is a nuisance, growers can try an aggressive tillage program to disrupt it. If a herbicide is needed for control in agronomic crops, Johnson recommended applying products containing dicamba.<\/p>\n<p>Farmers should be aware that some herbicides can damage legumes or other desired vegetation, so they need to double-check labels before applying them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amanda Gee, 765-494-8402, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/agee@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agee@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Bill Johnson, 765-494-4656, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/wgj@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">wgj@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/weed-scientist-control-poison-hemlock-in-the-fall.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

If farmers have questions about proper soil sampling procedures, they can contact a local Purdue Extension agricultural and natural resources educator or an agribusiness consultant who specializes in soil fertility.<\/p>\n<p>\"Some people want to start with seed selection to improve a thin or unproductive forage stand,\" Johnson said. \"But throwing more seed on the ground will not give desired results if they haven't taken care of the underlying problem. They need to do a soil test first if one has not been done in the last couple of years.\"<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the soil test, he said producers should ask themselves:<\/p>\n<p>* What forages are in the pasture?<\/p>\n<p>* Are weeds increasing and desired forages decreasing?<\/p>\n<p>* What stresses did the stand experience this year?<\/p>\n<p>* Was the pasture overgrazed or has it been overgrazed for a number of years?<\/p>\n<p>* Did the previous fertilization program work?<\/p>\n<p>The answers can help determine if, how and when a pasture should be renovated.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson said the foundation for most pastures in Indiana and the Midwest should be cool-season grasses and legumes. But producers may have the opportunity to use warm-season perennials or annuals in individual fields.<\/p>\n<p>Producers should also be scouting pastures for weeds. Many weeds can be problematic, but producers need to pay special attention to poisonous weeds and perennial weeds that vegetatively propagate, which means they spread by means other than a seed.<\/p>\n<p>\"If producers identify weeds that truly are or will be a problem in the future, then they need to get them under control,\" Johnson said. \"Herbicide application could still happen this fall if actively growing vegetation is present and the temperature is warm enough for translocation of the herbicide.\"<\/p>\n<p>Producers need to look at herbicide labels for specific details and be attentive to grazing and plant-back restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>After soil test results have been received, Johnson said they should also consider adding recommended amendments as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\"We like to fertilize actively growing perennial plants with phosphorus and potassium before the growth cycle is done for the season, and that will come to an end soon,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Applying limestone to increase soil pH is still possible this fall, and applying it now will give the soil time to adjust pH over the winter.<\/p>\n<p>If pastures did well this year and there's still a lot of forage growth, Johnson recommended that farmers allow animals to graze to reduce the amount of forage present in the pasture.<\/p>\n<p>\"Four inches or less should be left in the pasture for 2013 if overseeding in late winter occurs,\" Johnson said. \"We want seeds to get to the soil surface, not stuck in leftover forage.\"<\/p>\n<p>Producers can find more information in the Forage Field Guide, ID-317, which is available in Purdue Extension's <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.the-education-store.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Education Store<\/a> for $7 per copy. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amanda Gee, 765-494-8402, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/agee@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agee@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Keith Johnson, 765-494-4800, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/johnsonk@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">johnsonk@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/early-fall-is-a-good-time-to-assess-pastures,-plan-improvements.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Farmers can use double cropping and get both beans and wheat in. Wheat also provides a nice break in normal corn to soybean crop rotations.\"<\/p>\n<p>Casteel said the timing of wheat planting usually depends on three factors: corn and soybean harvest, weather and Hessian fly-free dates.<\/p>\n<p>Since wheat planting follows harvest, Casteel said it's always a good idea to start with as clean a field as possible in terms of weeds, and to correct nutritional deficiencies.<\/p>\n<p>If farmers are planting wheat following corn, the crop residue could be a source of disease for the wheat.<\/p>\n<p>This year, weather conditions have been favorable for Gibberella (also known as Fusarium graminearum in wheat) ear rot of corn in some fields. The fungus left behind in corn residue can transfer to a subsequent wheat crop, where it can cause head scab - a disease that can reduce yields and damage grain quality.<\/p>\n<p>The good news for wheat farmers is that after a flash-drought in parts of Indiana, much of the state has had rain recently.<\/p>\n<p>\"Fortunately, most parts of the state got some rain over the last couple weeks, so we're starting to get a little bit of a recharge in soil moisture, at least in the upper portion of the soil,\" Casteel said. \"If we have good soil moisture at planting, the crop will be off to a good start for stand establishment.\"<\/p>\n<p>Casteel also said farmers need to plant wheat after Hessian fly-free dates, which range from Sept. 22 in northern Indiana to Oct. 9 in southern Indiana.<\/p>\n<p>\"It's best to plant after those fly-free dates, or within 10 days or so of that date. The yield potential will likely drop if wheat is planted several weeks after that point. It's a balancing act,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Hessian flies are mosquitolike in appearance and feed on green plant growth, including developing wheat plants.<\/p>\n<p>More information about wheat, including planting considerations and growing season management, can be found in Purdue Extension's Wheat Field Guide, available through Purdue Extension's The Education Store at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.the-education-store.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.the-education-store.com<\/a> (search ID-448).

Conversely, if a plant has too much nitrogen, nitrate accumulates in the lower portion of the stalk.<\/p>\n<p>In order for cornstalk nitrate test (CSNT) results to help farmers alter their nitrogen management programs, the test needs to be conducted in multiple years, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/agry/directory/Pages/jcambera.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Camberato<\/a> said in a recent <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/extension.entm.purdue.edu/pestcrop/2013/issue23/index.html#corn\" target=\"_blank\">research update<\/a> in Purdue Extension's <i><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/extension.entm.purdue.edu/pestcrop/\" target=\"_blank\">Pest and Crop Newsletter<\/a>.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\"Multiple seasons of CSNT evaluation are warranted before altering an N management program because the optimum rate varies from season to season,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>The reason for the variation is that a series of factors affect the optimum rate. They include differences in soil nitrogen supply, loss of nitrogen from the root zone and differences in corn hybrid nitrogen use. Pests and weeds also can affect the amount of nitrogen used.<\/p>\n<p>\"The average correct N rate for maximizing profit over the long term is almost certainly wrong in any one season - either too much or too little,\" Camberato said. \"Thus, the evaluation of an N management system with the CSNT or any other N-assessment tool on any given field in a single season is interesting, but not particularly useful in making management decisions for future years.\"<\/p>\n<p>Instead, he recommended that growers maintain a database of end-of-season cornstalk nitrate tests and that they consider all of the data before adjusting fertilizer-based nitrogen-management programs.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to conduct a cornstalk nitrate test is to take 15 or more 8-inch stalk segments beginning 6 inches above the soil surface from representative areas of a field. The samples need to be collected within a few weeks after black layer, the point when corn is considered physiologically mature. They can then be sent to a lab and analyzed for nitrate-nitrogen (NO<sub>3<\/sub>-N), and the results can be compared with recommended rates in Indiana.<\/p>\n<p>Nitrate concentrations between 450 parts per million and 2,000 parts per million are considered optimal, while anything higher than 2,000 ppm is considered excessive, Camberato said.<\/p>\n<p>More in-depth information about cornstalk nitrate testing is available in Purdue Extension's free bulletin <i>Cornstalk Testing to Evaluate the Nitrogen Status of Mature Corn: Nitrogen Management Assurance.<\/i> The bulletin can be downloaded through Purdue Extension's <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.the-education-store.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Education Store<\/a> by searching for AY-322-W. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jennifer Stewart, 765-494-6682, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/jsstewar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsstewar@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Jim Camberato, 765-496-9338, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/jcambera@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jcambera@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/purdue-expert-offers-research-update-on-cornstalk-nitrate-tests.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Weather beyond October is more difficult to assess because climatological systems such as El Niño and La Niña that would drive Indiana weather into November are still evolving.<\/p>\n<p>\"This is a time when we should be cautious about looking too far into the future, especially when we don't have a dominant driver,\" said Dev Niyogi, state climatologist based at Purdue University. \"There are some years when we have very strong indicators. When El Niño and La Niña are active, they tend to dictate the weather of our upcoming season, and we can project with higher confidence whether it will be warmer or drier.\"<\/p>\n<p>The fall season will be influenced by multiple air masses, any of which could dominate at any time, Niyogi said.<\/p>\n<p>\"If we have a tropical atmosphere becoming more active, then we can expect more warmer and humid weather conditions, with more storm activity,\" he said. \"On the other hand, if that is not the dominant factor, then we might have the potential for a colder, drier air mass coming to Indiana more frequently.\"<\/p>\n<p>Which pattern might develop as the stronger of the two is in question at this time.<\/p>\n<p>\"And therein lies our dilemma at this point in drawing one strong, singular conclusion as to what will dominate,\" he said. \"But one thing that we can say for certain is in the absence of one strong driver and that we will be influenced by multiple air masses, it is very likely that Indiana will witness wide swings in its week-by-week weather as we go into the new season.\"<\/p>\n<p>Adding to the difficulty in forecasting is the unusual weather Indiana has experienced in the past couple of years, especially since last year when drought was so severe that it led to fire and watering bans and drastically lowered crop yields. Indiana emerged from drought over the winter with frequent precipitation, which was followed by an abundance of spring rain that delayed many farmers in planting their crops.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in another turnabout, Indiana this summer again fell into an extended dry period that brought back drought to some areas and lowered high expectations for excellent crop yields.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Drought Monitor update of Sept. 26 showed that heavy rains the previous week brought some relief to Indiana. Several counties in the state's midsection that had been in moderate drought - the lowest level of drought - improved to abnormally dry. Some other counties got enough rain to eliminate dry conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Niyogi said the climate office will continue to monitor the situation to determine whether any particular weather driver seems to become dominant. The office will provide an updated outlook later in the fall.<\/p>\n<p>Ken Scheeringa, associate state climatologist, said autumn typically is a difficult time for forecasting because the state is transitioning from the summer to weather patterns that will establish themselves for the winter.<\/p>\n<p>\"Sometimes there is a very sharp cutoff between seasons, but that's not happening,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>One thing about the fall that Scheeringa could say with absolute certainty - and with tongue in cheek: \"Autumn arrived at 4:44 p.m. EDT on Sept. 22 - exactly as predicted well in advance.\"  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Keith Robinson, 765-494-2722, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Dev Niyogi, 765-494-6574, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/climate@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">climate@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Ken Scheeringa, 765-494-8105, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/kens@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kens@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Related website:<\/strong><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/iclimate.org\" target=\"_blank\">Indiana State Climate Office<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/indiana-fall-weather-absent-a-dominant-driver-this-year.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Late-season stresses that interrupt seed-fill, such as weather, the environment, viral diseases or insect infestations, usually cause the problem.<\/p>\n<p>\"It's been noticed around the state, spots here and there where later-in-the-season weather stressed the plants,\" Shaun Casteel said. \"The dry weather and heat caused plants to abort pods. The plants' demand for pod development and seed fill wasn't there anymore, so the plants started maintaining the stem as the plant matured.\"<\/p>\n<p>Casteel said farmers should go into fields that seem to be browning and see if both the pods and stems are maturing.<\/p>\n<p>\"This year with some of those green stem-type fields, producers need to take a look at the pods themselves and the grain to see if they are dry enough for harvest,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Soybeans should be harvested at or slightly above 13 percent moisture to maximize yield, but green stems are tough to harvest.<\/p>\n<p>Casteel said producers with fields exhibiting green stem syndrome have two options.<\/p>\n<p>The first is to harvest the beans at optimal grain moisture to capture water weight. Doing so likely will slow harvest and increase fuel costs because of the green stems.<\/p>\n<p>\"For harvest, be prepared to have to chew through fields with green-stem syndrome with the combine, especially with older equipment,\" Casteel said.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to wait and harvest the plants when the stems turn brown. This option is easier on equipment but likely will reduce yield due to lost water weight. Delaying harvest for a few weeks also could allow the pods more time to dry out and possibly shatter.<\/p>\n<p>\"Producers need to be aware that this phenomenon is occurring so they can make informed decisions about optimizing harvest and reducing losses in yield and profit,\" Casteel said. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amanda Gee, 765-494-8402, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/agee@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agee@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Shaun Casteel, 765-494-0895, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/scasteel@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">scasteel@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q4/green-stem-syndrome-present-in-some-indiana-soybean-fields.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Lori Williams, executive director of the <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.invasivespecies.gov\" target=\"_blank\">National Invasive Species Council<\/a>, will provide a national perspective on the problem.<\/p>\n<p>One key topic of discussion will be a survey by the Invasive Plant Advisory Committee, which found that Indiana land owners and managers spent $5.85 million last year controlling invasive plants. The committee was created in 2010 to help the Indiana Invasive Species Council work on invasive plant issues in the state.<\/p>\n<p>The committee surveyed 116 agencies, land trusts, municipalities, contractors and private land owners throughout the state, representing more than 650,000 acres of managed public and private land in natural areas such as forests, prairies and wetlands. The survey did not include invasive species control in agricultural fields.<\/p>\n<p>The survey is a good representation of invasive plant management underway in Indiana, said Ellen Jacquart, a committee member and Northern Indiana Stewardship director of <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.nature.org\" target=\"_blank\">The Nature Conservancy<\/a>, one of the land trusts whose lands have invasive plants. <\/p>\n<p>\"The responses demonstrate how invasive species have gotten a strong foothold in Indiana and how expensive it is to remove them,\" Jacquart said.<\/p>\n<p>Of the groups surveyed, state agencies spent the most on invasive plant management in 2012 - nearly $3 million. Land trusts and municipalities came in second and third, respectively, each group spending slightly more than $1 million. <\/p>\n<p>The survey revealed that Indiana landowners and managers need to control a wide variety of invasive plant species; the survey identified nearly 50 species of invasive plants being managed statewide. More than 73 percent of survey participants reported that they have garlic mustard, making it the most commonly controlled invasive plant in Indiana.<\/p>\n<p>Controlling invasive species is made more difficult because many plant stores in Indiana still sell several species of them.<\/p>\n<p>\"More than 95 percent of those surveyed supported removing invasive plants from commercial trade,\" Jacquart said. \"The state is currently exploring a rule that would do just that.\"<\/p>\n<p>The full report is available on the Indiana Invasive Species Council's website at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.entm.purdue.edu/iisc/pdf/Invasive_Plant_Management_Costs_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.entm.purdue.edu/iisc/pdf/Invasive_Plant_Management_Costs_Report.pdf<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The conference is open to the public.

Ear rots can cause significant economic loss, especially if the fungi produce mycotoxins, which pose problems for both livestock and humans.<\/p>\n<p>\"As harvest begins, it's important to identify fields that may have rots to ensure timely harvest and proper storage of moldy grain,\" Kiersten Wise said. \"And proper identification of ear rots is key to managing affected grain.\"<\/p>\n<p>Wise said farmers should be examining corn for Aspergillus, Fusarium, Diplodia and Gibberella ear rots this year.<\/p>\n<p>Aspergillus ear rot is caused by the Aspergillus flavus fungus and is characterized by an olive green, dusty mold at the tip of the ear or scattered on kernels. Symptoms usually appear first in fields with dry soils, nutrient deficiencies or insect damage. It's also one of the most concerning ear rots because of its associated mycotoxin, aflatoxin.<\/p>\n<p>\"Aflatoxin is a potent carcinogen and is regulated in feed and silage,\" Wise said. \"It's particularly of concern to dairy producers because Food and Drug Administration regulations require aflatoxin residues in milk to be less than 0.5 parts per billion.\"<\/p>\n<p>To prevent carryover into milk, silage and other feed components shouldn't contain more than 20 parts per billion of aflatoxin.<\/p>\n<p>Fusarium ear rot, primarily caused by Fusarium verticilliodes fungus, often overlaps with Aspergillus since warmer temperatures favor infection. The mycotoxin fumonisin is associated with this ear rot. Infected ears might have white fungal growth on the cob or discolored kernels scattered throughout.<\/p>\n<p>\"Fungal growth isn't always visible, but a white starburst pattern in kernels can sometimes be observed on infected ears,\" Wise said.<\/p>\n<p>A common Corn Belt disease is Diplodia ear rot, caused by the Stenocarpella maydis fungus. It survives in corn residue and infects plants about two weeks after pollination. Humidity and rain before and after pollination also help the disease develop.<\/p>\n<p>With Diplodia ear rot, white fungal growth on the cob often forms a mat of fungus across the ear. Other symptoms include brown or gray kernels and small black fungal structures called pycnidia that may form on the kernels or cob.<\/p>\n<p>The fungus is reported to produce the mycotoxin diplodiatoxin in South America and South Africa, but no toxic effects on livestock or humans have been reported in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Gibberella ear rot, caused by the Gibberella zeae fungus, infects plants during early silking and pollination. It favors cooler temperatures than the other ear rots, and produces a pink or reddish mold that can form a fungal mat similar to Diplodia.<\/p>\n<p>Gibeberella zeae produces the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin. Wise said this mycotoxin can be extremely harmful to swine and is carefully regulated by the FDA.<\/p>\n<p>\"If ear rots are observed in a field, affected areas should be harvested early and grain segregated to avoid contaminating non-infected grain with mycotoxins,\" she said.<\/p>\n<p>Mycotoxins are byproducts of the fungal infections, not living organisms. They cannot be killed or removed from the grain. But producers can remove small particles such as foreign material containing mycotoxins by screening or cleaning the grain or coring grain bins to help reduce the mycotoxin levels.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Grain Inspection Handbook, available at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.gipsa.usda.gov/Publications/pub_fgis.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/Publications/pub_fgis.html<\/a>, has additional information on mycotoxins and handling of infected grain.    <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amanda Gee, 765-494-8402, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/agee@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agee@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Kiersten Wise, 765-496-2170, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/kawise@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kawise@purdue.edu<\/a>    <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/plant-pathologist-several-corn-ear-rots-possible-this-year.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

It has 72 buses and about 30,000 riders daily. <\/p>\n<p>The objective of the study was to help CityBus find the most effective way to reduce operating costs and make the fleet \"greener.\" Tyner, graduate student Lin Yang and postdoctoral researcher Kemal Sarica performed economic and environmental analyses of the transit system using scenarios of buses fueled by compressed natural gas, diesel and a hybrid of diesel and electricity.<\/p>\n<p>CityBus already runs some diesel-electric buses, which have a higher fuel economy than a standard diesel bus but considerably higher capital expense in the form of higher bus costs. So it is considering natural gas among its options. Most buses in the United States use diesel fuel.<\/p>\n<p>The report concludes that buses fueled by natural gas would be the lowest-cost option for CityBus in a 15-year project that examined expenses of buying buses, maintaining them and keeping them fueled. The diesel-electric hybrid would be the costliest.<\/p>\n<p>Even with the $2 million expense of building a natural-gas fueling station, the natural-gas system would cost $48 million over the span of the project, compared with $54 million for the diesel-electric and $48.5 million for the diesel-only, according to the report.<\/p>\n<p>The analysis was conducted taking into account likely future diesel and natural-gas prices. Over 20 years, the analysis concludes that the natural-gas option has a 65 percent to 100 percent chance of being lower cost than the diesel option, depending on how price uncertainty is characterized.<\/p>\n<p>\"Moreover, from the environmental perspective, the implementation of CNG buses in the fleet would also produce less emission and provide benefit to the environment of the local society,\" the report says.<\/p>\n<p>Emissions of carbon dioxide and particulate matter would continually decrease over the project period if the CityBus fleet were gradually converted for natural gas. Carbon dioxide emissions from a diesel-electric hybrid system also would decrease but to a lesser extent, while those emissions from diesel-only buses would increase. Particulate matter from those two systems would remain about what they are now.<\/p>\n<p> The report notes that production of natural gas in the U.S. has increased dramatically in recent years, particularly from the rapid growth in shale gas, and is expected to increase until 2035. It also says the price difference between crude oil and natural gas has grown larger since 2009.<\/p>\n<p>But it also says transit companies are likely to make the switch to natural gas only when the additional capital costs, such as buying new buses and building natural-gas refueling stations, are covered by the savings in fuel costs over the life spans of the buses.<\/p>\n<p>Officials of the transit system will consider the results of the report, said Martin Sennett, general manager of CityBus.<\/p>\n<p>\"Dr. Tyner was extremely helpful to CityBus in helping to formulate a decision on the pros and cons of each fuel choice,\" Sennett said.<\/p>\n<p>The full report is available at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ese3.14/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ese3.14/pdf<\/a>            <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Keith Robinson, 765-494-2722, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Wally Tyner, 765 494-0199, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/wtyner@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">wtyner@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Martin Sennett, 765-423-2666, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/msennett@gocitybus.com\" target=\"_blank\">msennett@gocitybus.com<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/purdue-study-buses-fueled-by-natural-gas-a-better-option-now.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Yield components of soybeans are pods, seed size and number of seeds per pod.<\/p>\n<p>\"Individual plant production varies, and every field will vary based on pests, soils, fertility and other factors,\" said Shaun Casteel. \"But I've simplified the process of estimating soybean yields so that producers can scout multiple areas quickly while maintaining representative estimates.\"<\/p>\n<p>Casteel's system is based on estimated yield in one ten-thousandth of an acre. The basic formula involves multiplying the number of pods by the number of seeds per pod, then dividing that result by the seed size factor. That calculation will show the estimated bushels per acre.<\/p>\n<p>To calculate, producers first need to count the number of pods in one ten-thousandth of an acre, an area determined by a 21-inch length of a row of plants and how far apart the rows were planted.<\/p>\n<p>\"Nearly 90 percent of our Indiana soybean acres are planted in 30-, 15- or 7.5-inch rows, so just remember that each count needs to be 21 inches long,\" Casteel said. \"You will count the number of pods in one row for 30-inch width, two rows for 15-inch and four rows for 7.5-inch.\"<\/p>\n<p>Producers should count the number of pods that are at stage R5 or higher - when they can see seeds. <\/p>\n<p>Next, they must determine the number of seeds per pod. Casteel said using the average of 2.5 seeds per pod is best because there can be a range of 1-4 seeds per pod.<\/p>\n<p>\"This value is conservative since we don't know exactly how the rest of the season will finish,\" Casteel said.<\/p>\n<p>Changing this one value can increase or decrease yield estimates.<\/p>\n<p>The third step is to calculate seed size factor. Casteel said the starting point is seed size factor 18, equaling about 3,000 seeds per pound.<\/p>\n<p>\"If you expect larger seeds from late-season rains, you would divide by a lower seed size factor such as 15, which equals about 2,500 seeds per pound,\" he said. \"If the field has late-season stress, such as a lack of water, you would divide by a higher seed size factor like 21, or 3,500 seeds per pound.\"<\/p>\n<p>For most Indiana fields in 2013, the seed size factor will be between 18 and 21, Casteel said.<\/p>\n<p>The three values – number of pods in stage R5 or higher, number of seeds per pod and seed size factor - go into Casteel's equation. For example, 250 pods times 2.5 seeds per pod divided by a seed size factor 15 equals 41.7 bushels per acre.<\/p>\n<p>Fair soybean growth with limited pod retention but with good late-season moisture will result in a fair crop.  <\/p>\n<p>Although producers can start estimating yields as soybeans enter the R5 stage, the estimates will be more accurate as soybeans develop and enter R6, or full seed. If soybeans are just coming into R6, Casteel said the yield potential still depends on pod retention and seed size.<\/p>\n<p>The weather is an important contributor to yield potential, and dry conditions over the past 4-5 weeks have lowered yield potential in some fields.<\/p>\n<p>\"Reductions in excessive heat and the return of rain helped yield potentials more in seed size than pod retention assuming the soybeans are into R6 and beginning to drop leaves,\" Casteel said. \"If fields are green, soybean yield potentials could improve. If fields are losing foliage, yield gains will be very limited.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amanda Gee, 765-494-8402, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/agee@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agee@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Shaun Casteel, 765-494-0895, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/scasteel@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">scasteel@purdue.edu<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p><b>Related websites:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/agry\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue Department of Agronomy<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www3.ag.purdue.edu/extension\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue Extension<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/formula-will-help-when-estimating-soybean-yield-potential.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

The daylong workshop will focus on grasses that can be grown on land that isn't well suited for row-crop production.<\/p>\n<p>\"Indiana is a place where about 15 percent of the arable soil is considered marginal for corn and soybean production,\" said Chad Martin, Purdue Extension renewable energy specialist. \"These less productive soils can be used for bioenergy grass production.\"<\/p>\n<p>Land could be considered marginal for many reasons, such as problems with water-holding capacity, depth of soil or soil composition - any of which means less yield and profit for farmers growing crops like corn or soybean.<\/p>\n<p>The workshop will be split into two sessions.<\/p>\n<p>The morning program will give participants an opportunity to see engines that run on alternative fuels at Caterpillar Inc., 3701 State Route 26 E., Lafayette. The session will include presentations by energy professionals and a facilities tour.<\/p>\n<p>To register for the morning session, contact Martin at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/martin95@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">martin95@purdue.edu<\/a> by Oct. 7.<\/p>\n<p>The afternoon session will focus specifically on plants that can be grown for biomass energy production. It will run 1:30-4:30 p.m. at the Throckmorton-Purdue Agricultural Center, 8343 U.S. 231, Lafayette.<\/p>\n<p>Keith Johnson, Purdue Extension forage specialist who is heading up the afternoon session, said forage grasses tend to come closer to optimum production on marginal land as compared to corn or soybean. They reduce soil erosion and water runoff, improve soil quality, provide a natural habitat for wildlife and yield high amounts of biomass.<\/p>\n<p>\"The grasses we're focusing on are big bluestem, Indiangrass and switchgrass, which are all native, warm-season perennial grasses,\" he said. \"Non-native grasses that a core group of researchers are looking at include Miscanthus and sorghum.\"<\/p>\n<p>Register in advance for the afternoon session by contacting Lisa Green at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/lgreen06@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">lgreen06@purdue.edu<\/a> or 765-494-4783.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson and Martin are part of a multistate working group called cenUSA Bioenergy that is researching ways to create a sustainable biofuels system for the central United States.

The guide is updated frequently as grain futures prices change and the costs of inputs, such as seed, fertilizer, chemicals and fuel, fluctuate.<\/p>\n<p>According to Michael Langemeier, Purdue Extension agricultural economist, there are two main drivers in the 2014 guide compared with the 2013 edition - falling grain prices and fertilizer costs.<\/p>\n<p>\"The expected drop in corn, soybean and wheat prices is having a large negative impact on market revenue and contribution margins,\" he said. \"More positive is the expected continued decline in fertilizer costs. Fertilizer prices are quite a bit lower right now compared to what they were last fall when we were working on the 2013 guide.\"<\/p>\n<p>According to guide estimates, revenues for rotation corn on average-productivity land could fall by $140 per acre compared with 2013. Rotation soybean revenues on average-productivity land could fall by $35 per acre.<\/p>\n<p>Those changes in grain prices and input costs mean it's even more important for growers to estimate their budgets for the next year, Langemeier said. As it looks now, rotation soybeans could be more profitable than continuous corn for some farmers in the coming year.<\/p>\n<p>\"Rotation soybeans are looking very attractive for 2014, so we could see more rotation soybeans than continuous corn,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, the per-acre contribution margin (revenue minus variable costs) for rotation soybeans on average land is an estimated $395, while continuous corn is $277. Those numbers could change, however, as the 2013 cropping season wraps up.<\/p>\n<p>Langemeier also pointed out that the estimates in the guide won't directly apply to individual farms.<\/p>\n<p>\"This guide is not going to be directly applicable to any farm,\" he said. \"This guide is specifically that - a guide. It gives a person an idea of how market revenue should be computed, and it gives an idea of how we did it, using current futures prices and trend yields.<\/p>\n<p>\"More importantly, it gives someone an idea of the important costs that need to be included and how you would calculate those costs for a specific farm, for a specific field and for a specific enterprise, such as rotation corn.\"<\/p>\n<p>Included in the guide are illustrations of how to calculate variable costs - fertilizer, seed, fuel and chemicals - and overhead costs, such as machinery, operator labor and land rent.<\/p>\n<p>The guide focuses very heavily on figuring out a farm's opportunity costs when calculating overhead. Opportunity costs include the loss of money from alternatives that aren't chosen. For example, if farmers own land and choose to farm it themselves, they give up potential rental income.<\/p>\n<p>\"We basically have two bottom lines in this guide,\" Langemeier said. \"The first one is called a contribution margin - that's market revenue minus variable costs. The second is earnings - the contribution margin minus overhead costs. The contribution margin should be positive because you have overhead costs you need to be able to cover. The earnings, we would expect over a long period of time, to be close to zero. Farmers need to include opportunity costs in a budget, such as the cost to own machinery, land rent and the fact that their labor is worth something.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jennifer Stewart, 765-494-6682, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/jsstewar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsstewar@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Michael Langemeier, 765-494-9557, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/mlangeme@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">mlangeme@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/purdue-economists-urge-farm-budget-calculations,-offer-guide.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

High grain-farm incomes capped a series of years with abnormally high grain prices. But with some drought relief in major corn- and soybean-production states leading to expected higher yields and lower commodity prices, grain farmers can expect to see changes in what they pay for inputs, such as seed, fertilizers, fuels and chemicals, for the 2014 crop.<\/p>\n<p>An apparent shift in market demand for corn and soybeans also could play a major role in what it will cost growers to produce the next crop, Alan Miller said.<\/p>\n<p>\"The markets are currently saying they want more soybeans and less corn in 2014, which changes the demand for inputs,\" he said. \"For example, growers don't need as much nitrogen fertilizer if they are growing less corn. That ultimately will affect the prices of inputs.\"<\/p>\n<p>The big story in 2014 crop production costs, Miller said, is fertilizer prices. Potash and phosphate prices have been declining since the fall of 2012 and are down 15-17 percent since last spring. Nitrogen prices peaked last spring and have dropped about 22 percent this fall. Farmers' ability to apply fertilizer this fall will help determine what prices will look like for next spring.<\/p>\n<p>\"If weather or a late harvest were to keep farmers from applying fertilizers this fall, it could drive fertilizer prices down for the spring,\" he said. \"Normally, fertilizer prices hit bottom in the early fall, but we will have to wait and see is if the market is weak enough to sustain the drop into the spring.\"<\/p>\n<p>Nitrogen prices also are falling because the U.S. is now a low-cost producer. North American fertilizer producers are expecting historically strong sales this fall.<\/p>\n<p>During the height of the ethanol boom, farmers were growing more corn and using more nitrogen. Plus, natural gas prices were high. Since then, natural gas prices have fallen, which has led to renewed interest in investing in domestic production capacity for nitrogen fertilizers. This leads to greater supplies of U.S.-produced nitrogen in the future if the cost of producing it here stays well below its market price as it is now.<\/p>\n<p>\"Corn growers really will start to see the full effect of more domestically produced nitrogen in 2015,\" Miller said. \"We have been importing more than 50 percent of our nitrogen fertilizer, meaning supply disruptions could easily impact prices. As we produce more of our own, we will import less. The bigger supply will benefit corn producers.\"<\/p>\n<p>Recent prices for nitrogen in anhydrous ammonia form have hovered around $700 per ton. According to Miller, that could possibly eventually fall to as low as $400 or $500 per ton if U.S. production capacity increases considerably.<\/p>\n<p>One area where farmers won't see price relief is seed costs. By Miller's estimates, some seed could be up by 2-3 percent or more for the 2014 planting season.<\/p>\n<p>\"Seed is not the place where growers will cut corners to try to save money,\" he said. \"They will be careful in pricing inputs, but they want the technology to produce the best crop possible.\"<\/p>\n<p>The prices of chemicals, such as herbicides, pesticides and fungicides, are likely to be a mixed bag. For the most part, chemical prices will be up slightly - about 1 percent, according to Miller. The exception is herbicide, where prices will remain flat.<\/p>\n<p>Prices for fuels commonly used on the farm currently are expected to be down in 2014. The costs for both diesel, which powers most farm machinery, and propane, which farmers use to power grain dryers, could be down by about 4 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Fuel prices, however, can be among the most volatile costs farmers encounter each year because much of it is imported. While an increase in domestic energy production has helped thwart major supply disruptions, Miller said tensions abroad could affect what farmers pay for fuel in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>\"We have to be a concerned because of the unrest in the Middle East,\" he said. \"It could quickly change the fuel-price outlook.\"<\/p>\n<p>Farmers who have wanted to purchase new tractors, combines, implements or other machinery have encountered increasing prices. Machinery prices increased by an average of 7.4 percent per year from 2002 to 2012 because record-high farm incomes increased demand. The sustained increases in machinery prices could quickly come to a halt, especially for used farm equipment, if commodity prices decline and stay down for an extended period of time, Miller said.<\/p>\n<p>As producers make their decisions about inputs for the 2014 crop year, Miller said the bottom line is that they should keep an eye on the economics of each decision. For fertilizer, that means waiting to see if prices continue to decline, while it also means going ahead and spending the money now for seed that best fits individual production systems.<\/p>\n<p>For chemicals, Miller said it means determining whether the benefits outweigh the costs.<\/p>\n<p>\"Farmers always need to look for ways to be more efficient by looking for ways to drive down the cost per unit of output,\" he said. \"They also need to be cautious with capital investments, such as equipment and land purchases and rents.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jennifer Stewart, 765-494-6682, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/jsstewar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsstewar@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Alan Miller, 765-494-4203, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/millerwa@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">millerwa@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/ag-economist-2013-a-transition-year-for-grain-farmers.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

But landlords, who face a Nov. 30 deadline for lease terminations in the state of Indiana, sometimes want to wait until closer to the deadline so they have a better idea of what farm incomes might look like in the coming year.<\/p>\n<p>\"Tenants like to know by September about land to lease for 2014 if they don't already have a lease arrangement for a particular farm or parcel,\" said Gerry Harrison, Purdue Extension agricultural economist. \"However, a landlord might want to wait until November if there is doubt about the lease terms for 2013. The outlook for 2014 in November might be much different than in September of the current year.\"<\/p>\n<p>One lease arrangement that might suit both parties is a flexible lease. In this type of agreement, terms are included to address actual variations in crop yields or prices in determining a final rent payment, Harrison said.<\/p>\n<p>If a landlord or tenant is uncertain about continuing with the current terms of a lease arrangement, such as the rent rate, Harrison said it's best to start renegotiations with a notice to quit, or terminate a lease.<\/p>\n<p>\"From litigation in Indiana in 2012, it would be careless to deal with anything other than a written notice, properly delivered, to end the current lease and to open up negotiation for new lease terms,\" he said. \"To give notice to terminate an existing lease does not need to imply the tenant and landowner can't reach a new agreement, and tenants who have a lease in place for the coming year might be wise to revisit the arrangement with the landlord.<\/p>\n<p>\"If there is no more than a comment or oral notice that a new rent or other new lease terms need to be agreed to, the parties to the lease might find that they are under the same terms for the 2014 lease.\"<\/p>\n<p>Indiana rules about written lease termination also apply to permanently terminated leases.<\/p>\n<p>The only time tenants and landlords are not entitled to a written notice to quit is when the initial lease agreement is a term lease that specifically states it can be terminated orally.<\/p>\n<p>According to Harrison, both tenants and landlords can protect themselves by consulting farm attorneys to end current lease agreements and set up new ones.<\/p>\n<p>Purdue Extension offers free resources to help farmers and landowners better understand farmland leases through The Education Store at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.the-education-store.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.the-education-store.com/<\/a>.

Training will begin at 9 a.m. and end at 3 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Steve Wettschurack, a Purdue farm rescue instructor, said the goal is to provide basic awareness safety and health training needed by young people interested in pursuing employment in the commercial grain industry or who are already employed on family-operated farms with grain storage operations. He said about one in every five victims of serious accidents at grain storage and handling facilities are people under the age of 21.<\/p>\n<p>\"The primary cause of these tragic events has been the lack of awareness of basic hazards associated with storage and handling of grain and failure to comply with safe grain-handling practices,\" Wettschurack said.<\/p>\n<p>Participants will learn the importance of the grain industry and career opportunities.

Sample Dean of Agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>\"In addition, we will be embedding educational opportunities for students throughout this process of discovery and innovation, creating a unique learning opportunity for the next generation of leaders in the plant sciences,\" Akridge said.<\/p>\n<p>Gebisa Ejeta, distinguished professor of agronomy and 2009 World Food Prize laureate, said the funding reflects Purdue's leadership role in working to find ways to feed a world population expected to increase from about 7 billion now to 9 billion by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>\"Science, technology and innovation are key to feeding humanity sustainably,\" Ejeta said. \"With this investment, Purdue University is making a commitment to the future of agriculture in Indiana and beyond and showing the collective resolve that we all share at this institution to remain among the very top tier of leading universities in the world.\"<\/p>\n<p>The plant sciences investment will be divided into these main areas, with student engagement a fundamental part of each:<\/p>\n<p>* Expanding research and education in plant biology through 10 new faculty hires that would be affiliated with a new Center for Molecular Agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>* Enhancing the college's ability to move research discoveries into commercially important crops with development of a plant transformation facility, which will bridge a gap between identification of valuable genes in crop production and their commercialization.<\/p>\n<p> * Building high-speed, large-scale capabilities to assess crop characteristics and performance through automated field phenotyping that will provide for detailed assessments of plant traits that are important for both research and commercialization.<\/p>\n<p>* Establishing a plant commercialization incubator facility to create opportunities for plant sciences faculty and students to move their ideas to the farm and the marketplace through commercialization and licensing arrangements.<\/p>\n<p>* Developing student leaders in the plant sciences through a precollege summer institute to help attract students to the area, research and experiential learning activities throughout the curriculum, and engagement in licensing and commercialization.<\/p>\n<p>The university initiatives were developed over several months of work that involved deans, faculty and others at the university. The university's trustees have reviewed and given support for the programs.<\/p>\n<p>\"This investment in the plant science research and education pipeline will catapult Purdue's efforts to enable faculty and students to translate their creativity into new products to help feed a hungry world,\" said Karen Plaut, senior associate dean for research and faculty affairs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Keith Robinson, 765-494-2722, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu%C3%82%C2%A0\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu <\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Mitch Daniels, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/president@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">president@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Jay Akridge, 765-494-8391, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/akridge@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">akridge@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Gebisa Ejeta, 765-494-4320, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/gejeta@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">gejeta@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Karen Plaut, 765-494-8362, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/kplaut@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kplaut@purdue.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><b>Related website:<br><\/b> <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.purdue.edu/purduemoves/\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue Moves the World Forward<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Video Link:<\/strong><br>\nPlant sciences initiative video - <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/youtu.be/rI9pdbr2NEc\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/rI9pdbr2NEc<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/purdue-ag-to-receive-major-funding-for-plant-sciences.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

This year, the soil was moist in the spring with dry weather later in the season. As of Thursday (Sept. 12), the U.S. Drought Monitor rated portions of 11 counties in northwestern Indiana in the moderate drought category, and much of the northern half of the state was listed as abnormally dry - a drought-watch category.<\/p>\n<p>\"There are many regions that did not get the amount of moisture in August and early September needed to keep forage production moving forward,\" Keith Johnson said. \"We shouldn't be overgrazing pastures that aren't growing well because of the lack of moisture.<\/p>\n<p>\"If pastures are grazed too aggressively this fall, there will be less forage available in the spring.\"<\/p>\n<p>Cool-season grasses such as timothy, perennial ryegrass, tall fescue and orchardgrass should be accumulating new growth now as cooler temperatures occur and will produce tillers in the fall that initiate new growth in the spring. The late-summer growth that typically occurs has been deterred by hot conditions and lack of rain during this period.<\/p>\n<p>Along with avoiding overgrazing, Johnson recommended that farmers know what they have in inventory to evaluate if they have sufficient forage supplies to get through the late fall and winter.<\/p>\n<p>Farmers who think they will be short on forages going into winter have many options for supplementing current supplies.<\/p>\n<p>\"If forages are insufficient, producers should find additional or alternative feed sources, or reduce the number of mouths to feed,\" Johnson said. \"First, I would have them think about whether corn residue grazing or feeding harvested corn residues is a possibility in their livestock operation.\"<\/p>\n<p>Farmers should also start contacting other producers who might have a forage surplus and consider supplementing with byproduct feeds that work with the quality of forage being fed.<\/p>\n<p>\"Lastly, I would say if there happens to be late planted corn and grain production is going to be heavily sacrificed, producers could consider making corn silage,\" Johnson said.<\/p>\n<p>Farmers with cornfields under severe drought stress should check with their crop insurance representative before silage harvest occurs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amanda Gee, 765-494-8402, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/agee@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agee@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Keith Johnson, 765-494-4800, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/johnsonk@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">johnsonk@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/farmers-should-avoid-overgrazing,-check-forage-inventories-now.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

Purdue Farm Road, Dubois.<\/p>\n<p>The event will kick off with a four-mile multisurface fun run/walk at 8:30 a.m. Tower said it will be similar to a trail run because participants will run on pavement, rock, grass pastures and dirt.<\/p>\n<p>The race entry fee is $25 per person registered by Sept. 20 and $30 after. The fee includes a T-shirt for the first 100 participants and refreshments. Awards will be given to the overall male and female and to the top three participants in the age categories. To register, contact Tower at 812-678-4427 or the Dubois County Extension office at 812-482-1782.<\/p>\n<p>Other morning activities include geo-caching, fish cleaning, a weather station and a goat milking demonstration. Tower encourages attendees to bring lunch and enjoy a picnic on the farm.<\/p>\n<p>The afternoon sessions run 1:30-5 p.m. Industry experts will discuss cattle care and concerns, hay storage and using goats for woodland invasive plant control. The day will conclude with a pasture walk and evaluation of the center.<\/p>\n<p>More information on the activities can be found at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/https/ag.purdue.edu/arp/pac/Pages/sipac-home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://ag.purdue.edu/arp/pac/Pages/sipac-home.aspx<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Amanda Gee, 765-494-8402, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/agee@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">agee@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Jason Tower, 812-678-4427, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/towerj@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">towerj@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/purdue-agricultural-center-to-host-field-day-for-farmers,-families.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"

In fact, for some fields, the ‘cake' is disappearing<ins cite=\"mailto:Robinson,%20Keith\" datetime=\"2013-09-10T11:41\">,<\/ins> too.\"<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Drought Monitor update of Sept. 5 showed that about one-third of Indiana was abnormally dry - the lowest level of dryness - while a small swath of the northwestern part of the state fell into moderate drought.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday (Sept. 9), the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that an estimated 67 percent of Indiana's corn crop is at the dent stage of kernel development. That leaves nearly one-third of the crop in dough stage, meaning 50 percent of its yield potential is yet to be determined.<\/p>\n<p>According to Nielsen, there is a common misconception that growers don't have to worry about yield potential when corn has hit dent.<\/p>\n<p>\"Once corn reaches dent stage, many folks can be heard confidently stating that there is no reason to worry about further crop stresses because 'the crop is made,'\" he said. \"Actually, by the time a crop reaches full dent, only about 60 percent of the crop has been 'made' and there is still 40 percent of the potential yield on the table yet to be determined.\"<\/p>\n<p>In fact, corn plants can still fall victim to sudden and complete death as late as two weeks before physiological maturity if conditions are bad enough, Nielsen said. Whole plant death can translate to yield losses as high as 12 percent.<\/p>\n<p>\"A crop is not 'made' until it has successfully reached physiological maturity,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Growers recognize physiological maturity when they can see a thin, black layer at the tips of kernels, which prevents further photosynthate into the grain.<\/p>\n<p>Some of Indiana's most stressed corn plants can be found in soils that have low water-holding capacity or significant soil compaction. Plants in those fields have shown stress in the form of leaf rolling, lower leaf death or whole plant death.<\/p>\n<p>But even crops planted in high-quality soils are showing signs of stress.<\/p>\n<p>\"The effects of inadequate rainfall throughout much of the grain-filling period in Indiana and elsewhere have, at times, been amplified by the effects of excessively warm temperatures,\" Nielsen said. \"Certainly not every field of corn is in dire straits at the moment. Certainly there will be fields of corn that yield well or possibly better than they ever have in the past. Just as certainly, there will be fields with significant yield losses due to excessively dry soils and excessively hot temperatures during the past 30 days or so.\"<\/p>\n<p>Severe stress this late in the growing season, especially during grainfill after successful pollination and kernel set, can cause plants to 'cannibalize' themselves to meet carbohydrate needs of developing grain, Nielsen said.<\/p>\n<p>Corn plants taking stored carbohydrate reserves in lower stalk and leaf tissues and moving them to developing ears can cause weakening of lower stalks and higher risk of root and stalk rots.<\/p>\n<p>\"Such cannibalized or diseased plants are naturally more apt to break over or lodge in response to strong winds, potentially turning grain harvest into a frustrating and challenging operation,\" Nielsen said. \"Growers ought to be walking drought-stressed fields during the next several weeks to assess the presence and severity of weakened stalks, then work toward prioritizing the weakest fields for early harvest to minimize the risk of significant mechanical harvest yield losses.\"<\/p>\n<p>For more information and frequent updates about the corn crop, visit Nielsen's \"Chat ‘N Chew Café\" website at <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/cafe/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/cafe/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Jennifer Stewart, 765-494-6682, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/jsstewar@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jsstewar@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source:<\/strong> Bob Nielsen, 765-494-4802, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/rnielsen@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">rnielsen@purdue.edu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ag Communications:<\/strong> (765) 494-2722;<br>\nKeith Robinson, <a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/mailto/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/robins89@purdue.edu\" target=\"_blank\">robins89@purdue.edu<\/a><br><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/r/http/www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgComm/public/agnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture News Page<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- Google Analytics for AgCom, keep at the bottom  -->\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><img src=\"http://fullrss.net/v/0970f70e205314578712a1df2e45b875/http/www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2013/Q3/dry-weather,-excessive-heat-still-choking-indiana-corn.html \"/><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://fullrss.net/\">fullrss.net<\/a><\/div>"
