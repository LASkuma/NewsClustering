<h2>Brantley Gilbert will perform at Purdue with Uncle Kracker, Greg Bates and Brian Davis</h2>
<div id="video-embed"><videoembed/></div>
<FirstPhoto/>
<p>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The <a href="http://brantleygilbert.com" target="_self">Brantley Gilbert</a> "Hell on Wheels Tour," with special guests <a href="http://www.unclekracker.com/" target="_self">Uncle Kracker</a>, <a href="http://gregbatesofficial.com" target="_self">Greg Bates</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/briandavislive1" target="_self">Brian Davis</a>, will perform at Purdue University's Elliott Hall of Music at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 27. This performance is presented by the <a href="http://www.convocations.org" target="_self">Purdue Convocations</a> and the Purdue Student Concert Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Brantley Gilbert</strong></p>
<p>Brantley Gilbert was born and raised in the small town of Jefferson, 
Georgia, near Athens.&#160; It is that upbringing and small-town influence 
that Gilbert credits toward allowing him to cultivate his unique sound. 
Gilbert's taste in music always swayed toward a southern country rock 
feel, but his true-to-life testimony of heartache, trials, triumph and 
success found a home in country music.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>He began his career playing acoustic sets in hometown venues, but he 
soon noticed that his audience had more interest in his rock-infused 
country music.&#160; In the past five years on the road, Gilbert has built 
his brand through his compelling lyrics and a dynamic live show. His 
fans now call themselves the BG Nation. Their enthusiasm led him to 
Nashville, where he soon signed with Warner/Chappell Publishing and 
released his debut album on an independent label, "A Modern Prodigal 
Son."</p>
<p>On March 16, 2010, his sophomore album, "Halfway to Heaven," peaked 
at No. 2 on the iTunes Country Album Charts, and at No. 1 on the 
Billboard Heatseekers Album Chart for all genres. It has remained on the
 charts for 112 weeks.</p>
<p>"The Best of Me," a song from Gilbert's first album, was recorded by 
country superstar Jason Aldean and earned a spot on his iTunes release 
"Wide Open." Then, in August 2010, Brantley's "My Kinda Party," became a
 No. 1 smash for Aldean, as well as the title tract to Aldean's 
platinum-selling album. The superstar's latest single, "Dirt Road 
Anthem," was also written by Gilbert.</p>
<p>In February 2011, Gilbert signed with Big Machine Label Group's The 
Valory Music Co., and scored a Top 40 country radio hit.&#160; His current 
hit "You Don't Know Her Like I Do" sits at No. 3 after 30 weeks on the 
charts.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/><strong>Uncle Kracker</strong></p>
<p>Uncle Kracker had a busy 2011 as part of Kenny Chesney's road tour 
and also headlining his own shows. The Detroit-based singer-songwriter's
 2010 release "Happy Hour - The South River Road Sessions," featured his
 singles "Smile" and "Good To Be Me" which featured guest vocals by Kid 
Rock. Initially known for his role as DJ in Kid Rock's legendary Twisted
 Brown Trucker band, Uncle Kracker made a stunning solo debut with 
2001's "Double Wide" album, which went 2 times platinum in sales.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><strong>Greg Bates</strong></p>
<p>Born and raised in Nashville, Bates is a true product of Music City, 
motivated not by the trappings of country-music stardom, but by the 
reward of a well-written lyric. The 24-year-old singer, guitarist and 
songwriter, is poised to release his self-titled major-label debut on 
Republic Nashville. Inspired by traditional 90's artists like Randy 
Travis, Dwight Yoakam and Alan Jackson, he soon found that some of the 
songs he heard on the radio were composed by his classmates' moms and 
dads. He attended Belmont University to study music, but it was always 
the story of the song that fascinated him. His intense work resulted in 
his first 10-song album which includes "Go Time," his first single "Did 
It for the Girl," and the explosive "I'm on It."</p>
<p><strong>Brian Davis</strong></p>
<p>Brian Davis was raised in the Carolinas between the Saturday night 
honkytonks and the Sunday morning steeples, surrounded by fields, farms 
and everything in between that makes country, country. You can hear it 
in his voice and the way he bends the strings on his telecaster. But 
there is also a side to him that, along with his country roots, has 
brought the mass appeal and extensive fan base that he now enjoys - his 
diverse love of music. From Matchbox-Twenty to Waylon to Counting Crows 
to Hank to Dwight Yoakam to Bob Marley to Garth to AC/DC to Tom Petty, 
it's all packed into his music. Davis' five studio albums are the fuel 
for his live shows, encompassing everything from heartbreaks to good 
times, tailgating to fishing, first times to last times. Find out more
