<p class="FORMAT-BODY">WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Older mothers are more likely to be
stressed when they receive help from an adult child who is not their preferred
caretaker, according to new research from Purdue University.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Most mothers have a preference for which child they turn
to in a crisis, confide in and prefer as their future caregivers," said
Jill Suitor, a professor of sociology. "And when mothers received care
from the adult child who was not their first choice, they reported more
depressive symptoms, such as sadness, loneliness and sleep disturbances.
Although mothers appreciated and acknowledged efforts from caregivers who were
not their first choices, these children were less likely to share the mothers'
values and to have the personal characteristics important to the mothers in
selecting preferred caregivers. This incompatibility can have some strong
negative effects."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">On the flip side, receiving care from a mother's preferred
child did not affect the mom's psychological well-being, she said.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"We expected having that preferred child care for a
parent would make a positive difference, but surprisingly it didn't,"
Suitor said. "And we also found that mothers' depressive symptoms were
higher when they received care from the non-preferred child than when they
received no care from their offspring."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Suitor, also a faculty member in Purdue's Center on Aging
and the Life Course who studies parental favoritism with adult children,
collaborated on this research with Megan Gilligan, a Purdue doctoral student,
and Karl Pillemer, professor and director of the Cornell Institute for
Translational Research on Aging at Cornell University. The research was funded
by the National Institute on Aging and is online in <i>The Gerontologist.</i></p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The findings were based on in-person interviews with 234
older mothers as part of a larger study of 566 multigenerational families that
began in 2001 when the mothers were 65-75 and had at least two adult children
still living. All of the mothers were interviewed again seven years later; the
new research is based on the 234 women who reported they needed care within the
previous two years because of serious injury or illness.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">During the initial interviews, 75 percent of the mothers
named a particular child they would prefer provide care if they became ill or
disabled. This was compared to the children's actual roles seven years later
after the mothers needed help. The reasons why preferred children sometimes
could not care for their moms were because they moved away or had medical
problems themselves.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Researchers also controlled for family size, and no
differences were found based on number of children.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The researchers found that being cared for by a
non-preferred child is stressful because the alternate caregivers did not
possess the social and emotional characteristics that the mothers expected.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"This matters because it makes people comfortable,
and this is especially important when people are under a lot of stress and in
situations where they relinquish control to another person," Suitor said.
"And who do you want to give up control to? To someone who has the same
outlook on life and who you think is very much like you, and, therefore, can
respond to your needs and be a source of reassuring support."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">For example, one of the moms in the study said that her
preferred caregiver, who lives far away, was her preference because they
"can talk about anything. I think she understands me best." And while
the mom acknowledged the daughter caring for her was helpful and reliable, she
couldn't talk with her as openly. She "would get annoyed with me.
Although, she's my rock here because she's the one that's here."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">These findings are similar to previous work by Suitor and
Pillemer that shows these factors are critical in relationships for spouses and
adult siblings. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">This connection also can be amplified as someone ages. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"As people become older and their health declines,
they start placing greater emphasis on relationships with family and friends
with whom they have a personal history or an especially close and comfortable relationship,
and reducing contact with people with whom they are less comfortable,"
Gilligan said. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">When asked about the implications of these findings,
Suitor said making assumptions about which children mothers want as their
caregivers may be problematic. Her previous studies on adult children and
mothers show that the children accurately predict whether their mothers favor
some children over others about 80 percent of the time, but they are correct
only about half the time in identifying which child the mom favors regarding
closeness, confiding in or for future care. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"We are not clinicians, but I think there are lessons
that can be learned from this research that can be put to use in conversations
that families have about advanced care planning," Suitor said.
"Perhaps these conversations can be expanded to include which children mom
would prefer provide her with care. Geography often plays a role in preventing
the preferred child from providing care, but perhaps the adult children
stepping into the role can call their brother or sister and say, 'I'm thinking
about doing this for mom, what do you think?' Ideally, they can coordinate and
avoid conflict."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The survey data is part of a 13-year project, the
Within-Family Difference Study, led by Suitor and Pillemer to evaluate the role
favoritism plays in adult and family relationships. The data for the project
was collected in the Boston metropolitan area by the Center for Survey Research
at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-WRITER">In the project's next phase, they plan to expand the study
of causes and consequences of favoritism to three generations of the families
they have been following. They also plan to extend the project by collecting
data from several hundred multigenerational Hispanic families in the Chicago
metropolitan area. </p>

<strong>ABSTRACT
</strong>
<div>
<p class="Abstract-TITLE"><strong>The
Role of Violated Caregiver Preferences in Psychological Well-Being When Older
Mothers Need Assistance</strong></p>
<p class="Abstract-AUTHORS"><em>J.
Jill Suitor, Megan Gilligan, Karl Pillemer</em></p>
<p class="Abstract-TEXT"><b>Purpose of the study:</b> Theory and research suggest that congruence
between individuals' preferences for future care and the patterns of care
received will affect well-being. In this paper, we explore whether older
mothers' psychological well-being was affected by whether the children they
preferred as future caregivers provided assistance at a later point when the
mothers experienced illness or injury.</p>
<p class="Abstract-TEXT"><b>Design and methods:</b> In this article we use a combination of
quantitative and qualitative data collected from 234 older mothers and two
points seven years apart, beginning when the mothers were 65-75.</p>
<p class="Abstract-TEXT"><b>Results:</b> Multivariate analyses demonstrated that mothers who
received assistance from children whom they did not identify as preferred
future caregivers reported higher depressive symptoms at T2; receiving care
from children identified as preferred caregivers did not affect well-being.
Qualitative data suggested these patterns occurred because the
"alternate" caregivers did not possess the socioemotional attributes
of preferred children.</p>
<p class="Abstract-TEXT"><b>Implications:</b> These findings contribute to a growing body of
research demonstrating the consequences of violated preferences, particularly
when individuals are in need of support in later life.</p>
