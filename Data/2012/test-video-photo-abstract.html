WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A two-year study of high schoolfootball players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits overtime and not from a single blow to the head, as commonly believed.
<p>Purdue University researchers have studied footballplayers for two seasons at Jefferson High School in Lafayette, Ind., where 21players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season,including 16 repeating players.</p>
<p>Helmet-sensor impact data from each player were comparedwith brain-imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before, during and aftereach season.</p>
<p>"The most important implication of the new findingsis the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow,but it's really the totality of blows that took place over the season,"said <a href="mailto:https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?id=12186">Eric Nauman</a>, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and anexpert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma. "The one hitthat brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel'sback."</p>
<p>Researchers evaluated players using a type of brainimaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, alongwith a computer-based neurocognitive screening test. The fMRI scans revealwhich parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/profile?resource_id=3304">Thomas Talavage</a>, an expert in functional neuroimaging andco-director of the Purdue MRI Facility, said the scans indicate players areadapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes.</p>

<p>"The changes in brain activity we are observingsuggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task,and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced," Talavage said."The level of change in the fMRI signal is significantly correlated to thenumber and distribution of hits that a player takes. Performance doesn'tchange, but brain activity changes, showing that certain areas are no longerbeing recruited to perform a task."</p>
<p>Findings, detailed in a paper to appear online in the Journal of Biomechanics, are contrary toconventional thinking.</p>
<p>"Most clinicians would say that if you don't have anyconcussion symptoms you have no problems," said <a href="mailto:https://www.cla.purdue.edu/hk/directory/Faculty/leverenz.html">Larry Leverenz</a>, an expertin athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology."However, we are finding that there is actually a lot of change, even whenyou don't have symptoms."</p>
<p>The paper was written by mechanical engineering graduatestudent Evan Breedlove, Nauman, Leverenz, Talavage, former Purdue professor ofeducational studies Jeffrey Gilger, biomedical engineering graduate studentMeghan Robinson, health and kinesiology graduate student Katherine E. Morigaki,electrical and computer engineering graduate student Umit Yoruk, mechanicalengineering undergraduate student Kyle O'Keefe, and undergraduate student inelectrical and computer engineering Jeffrey King. Gilger is now a researcher atthe University of California, Merced.</p>
<p>The research may help to determine how many blows it takesto cause impairment, which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting thenumber of hits a player receives per week.</p>
<p>"Any change in fMRI data is a concern, but we don'tyet know what these changes mean, what they translate to, in terms of cognitiveimpairment," Breedlove said.</p>
<p>A common assumption in sports medicine is that certainpeople are innately more susceptible to head injury. However, the new findingssuggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the mostimportant factor, Talavage said.</p>
<p>"Over the two seasons we had six concussed players,but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not haveconcussions," Talavage said. "There is good correlation with thenumber of hits players received, but we need more subjects."</p>
<p>The researchers have expanded the study to include anadditional high school football team and girls' soccer.</p>
<p>"We want to increase the number of football playersin the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don't wear headprotection," Nauman said. "We also want to include girls to seewhether they are affected differently than boys."</p>
<p>The research findings represent a dilemma because theysuggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>"This might be especially important in young peoplebecause the brain is still developing, so even though subtle unexpressed damagedoesn't manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life,"Gilger said.</p>
<p>Changes were seen in regions of the brain that have beenassociated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressivedegenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and otherforms of head injury.</p>
<p>"This is still circumstantial evidence, but itsuggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as aresult of all these hits, and the regions most affected are the ones thatexhibit CTE," Nauman said.</p>
<p>Players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1,900hits to the head in a single season, with two players exceeding 1,800 hits.Helmet-sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 Gs tomore than 100 Gs.</p>
<p>"The worst hit we've seen was almost 300 Gs,"Nauman said.</p>
<p>A soccer player "heading" a ball experiences animpact of about 20 Gs.</p>
<p>Findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive andaccurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions; moreaccurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from headimpacts; determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a singleimpact or repeated impacts; and develop new interventions to reduce the riskand effects of head impacts.</p>
<p>"Now that we know there is definitely a buildup ofdamage before the concussion occurs, ultimately, there is hope that we can domore to prevent concussions," Nauman said.</p>
<p>The work is ongoing and supported with grants from theIndiana State Department of Health's Spinal Cord and Brain Injury ResearchFund, General Electric Healthcare, the Indiana Clinical and TranslationalSciences Institute, and through the National Science Foundation and NationalDefense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowships.</p>
<p>Researchers also will follow the case studies of playerswho take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes inbrain structure using MRI scans.</p>
<p>The research group, called the <a href="http://spin.ecn.purdue.edu/png">Purdue Neurotrauma Group</a>(PNG), also is studying ways to reduce traumatic brain injury in soldiers whosuffer concussions caused by shock waves from explosions.</p>

<p class="Abstract-TEXT">Concussion is growing
public health issue in the United States, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE) is the chief long-term concern linked to repeated concussions. Recently,
attention has shifted toward subconcussive blows and the role they may play in
the development of CTE. We assembled a cohort of high school football players
for two seasons of observation. Accelerations sensors were placed in the
helmets, and all contact activity was monitored. Pre-season computer-based
neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests
were also obtained in order to assess cognitive and physiological health.
In-season follow-up scans were then obtained both from individuals who had
sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion and those who had not. These
changes were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows
recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan. In addition
to those subjects who had sustained a concussion, a substantial portion of our
cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological
changes. Stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the
biomechanical histories of subjects and the ensuing neurophysiological change,
suggesting that distinct injury processes are at play. Our findings reinforce
the hypothesis that the effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative
and that repeated exposure to subconcussive blows is connected to
pathologically altered neurophysiology. </p>
