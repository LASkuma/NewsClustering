<h2>New system could predict solar flares, give advance warning</h2>
<div id="video-embed"><videoembed/></div>
<FirstPhoto/>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Researchers may have discovered a
new method to predict solar flares more than a day before they occur, providing
advance warning to help protect satellites, power grids and astronauts from
potentially dangerous radiation.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The system works by measuring differences in gamma
radiation emitted when atoms in radioactive elements "decay," or lose
energy. This rate of decay is widely believed to be constant, but recent
findings challenge that long-accepted rule.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The new detection technique is based on a hypothesis that
radioactive decay rates are influenced by solar activity, possibly streams of
subatomic particles called solar neutrinos. This influence can wax and wane due
to seasonal changes in the Earth's distance from the sun and also during solar
flares, according to the hypothesis, which is supported with data published in
a dozen research papers since it was proposed in 2006, said <a href="http://www.physics.purdue.edu/faculty/ephraim/">Ephraim Fischbach</a>,
a Purdue University professor of physics.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Fischbach and <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/People/ptProfile?resource_id=7846">Jere Jenkins</a>, a nuclear engineer and
director of radiation laboratories in the School of Nuclear Engineering, are
leading research to study the phenomenon and possibly develop a new warning
system. Jenkins, monitoring a detector in his lab in 2006, discovered that the
decay rate of a radioactive sample changed slightly beginning 39 hours before a
large solar flare.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Since then, researchers have been examining similar
variation in decay rates before solar flares, as well as those resulting from
Earth's orbit around the sun and changes in solar rotation and activity. The
new findings appeared online last week<b> </b>in
the journal <i>Astroparticle Physics</i>. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"It's the first time the same isotope has been used
in two different experiments at two different labs, and it showed basically the
same effect," Fischbach said. The paper was authored by Jenkins and
Fischbach; Ohio State University researchers Kevin R. Herminghuysen, Thomas E.
Blue, Andrew C. Kauffman and Joseph W. Talnagi; U.S. Air Force researcher
Daniel Javorsek; Mayo Clinic researcher Daniel W. Mundy; and Stanford
University researcher Peter A. Sturrock.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Data were recorded during routine weekly calibration of an
instrument used for radiological safety at Ohio State's research reactor. Findings
showed a clear annual variation in the decay rate of a radioactive isotope
called chlorine 36, with the highest rate in January and February and the
lowest rate in July and August, over a period from July 2005 to June 2011. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The new observations support previous work by Jenkins and
Fischbach to develop a method for predicting solar flares. Advance warning
could allow satellite and power grid operators to take steps to minimize impact
and astronauts to shield themselves from potentially lethal radiation emitted
during solar storms.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The findings agree with data previously collected at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory regarding the decay rate of chlorine 36; changes
in the decay rate were found to match changes in the Earth-sun distance and
Earth's exposure to different parts of the sun itself, Fischbach said. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Large solar flares may produce a "coronal mass
ejection" of highly energetic particles, which can interact with the
Earth's magnetosphere, triggering geomagnetic storms that sometimes knock out
power. The sun's activity is expected to peak over the next year or so as part
of an 11-year cycle that could bring strong solar storms.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Solar storms can be especially devastating if the flare
happens to be aimed at the Earth, hitting the planet directly with powerful
charged particles. A huge solar storm, called the Carrington event, hit the
Earth in 1859, a time when the only electrical infrastructure consisted of
telegraph lines. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"There was so much energy from this solar storm that
the telegraph wires were seen glowing and the aurora borealis appeared as far
south as Cuba," Fischbach said. "Because we now have a sophisticated
infrastructure of satellites, power grids and all sort of electronic systems, a
storm of this magnitude today would be catastrophic. Having a day and a half
warning could be really helpful in averting the worst damage."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Satellites, for example, might be designed so that they
could be temporarily shut down and power grids might similarly be safeguarded
before the storm arrived.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Researchers have recorded data during 10 solar flares
since 2006, seeing the same pattern.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"We have repeatedly seen a precursor signal preceding
a solar flare," Fischbach said. "We think this has predictive
value."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">The Purdue experimental setup consists of a radioactive source
- manganese 54 - and a gamma-radiation detector. As the manganese 54 decays, it
turns into chromium 54, emitting a gamma ray, which is recorded by the detector
to measure the decay rate.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Purdue has filed a U.S. patent application for the
concept.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Research findings show evidence that the phenomenon is
influenced by the Earth's distance from the sun; for example, decay rates are
different in January and July, when the Earth is closest and farthest from the
sun, respectively.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"When the Earth is farther away, we have fewer solar
neutrinos and the decay rate is a little slower," Jenkins said. "When
we are closer, there are more neutrinos, and the decay a little faster."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Researchers also have recorded both increases and
decreases in decay rates during solar storms.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"What this is telling us is that the sun does
influence radioactive decay," Fischbach said. </p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Neutrinos have the least mass of any known subatomic
particle, yet it is plausible that they are somehow affecting the decay rate,
he said.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Physicist Ernest Rutherford, known as the father
of nuclear physics, in the 1930s conducted experiments indicating the
radioactive decay rate is constant, meaning it cannot be altered by external
influences.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">"Since neutrinos have essentially no mass or charge,
the idea that they could be interacting with anything is foreign to
physics," Jenkins said. "So, we are saying something that doesn't
interact with anything is changing something that can't be changed. Either
neutrinos are affecting decay rate or perhaps an unknown particle is."</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Jenkins discovered the effect by chance in 2006, when he
was watching television coverage of astronauts spacewalking at the
International Space Station. A solar flare had erupted and was thought to
possibly pose a threat to the astronauts. He decided to check his equipment and
discovered that a change in decay-rate had preceded the solar flare.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Further research is needed to confirm the findings and to
expand the work using more sensitive equipment, he said.</p>
<p class="FORMAT-BODY">Jenkins and Fischbach have previously collaborated with
Peter Sturrock, a professor emeritus of applied physics at Stanford University
and an expert on the inner workings of the sun, to<b> </b>examine data collected at Brookhaven on the decay rate of
radioactive isotopes silicon-32 and chlorine-36. The team reported in 2010 in <i>Astroparticle Physics</i> that the decay
rate for both isotopes varies in a 33-day recurring pattern, which they
attribute to the rotation rate of the sun's core.</p>
<p>The group found evidence of the same annual and 33-day
effect in radium-226 data taken at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
(PTB) in Braunschweig, Germany, and those findings were published in 2011. They
also found an additional 154-day recurring pattern in both the Brookhaven and
PTB data, published in 2011, which they believe to be solar related and similar
to a known solar effect called a Rieger periodicity.<b> <br/></b></p>

<p class="Abstract-TEXT">Additional experimental
evidence is presented in support of the recent hypothesis that a possible solar
influence could explain fluctuations observed in the measured decay rates of
some isotopes. These data were obtained during routine weekly calibrations of
an instrument used for radiological safety at the Ohio State University
Research Reactor using <sup>36</sup>Cl. The detector system used was based on a
Geiger-M&#252;ller gas detector, which is a robust detector system with very low
susceptibility to environmental changes. A clear annual variation is evident in
the data, with a maximum relative count rate observed in January/February, and
a minimum relative count rate observed in July/August, for seven successive
years from July 2005 to June 2011. This annual variation is not likely to have
arisen from changes in the detector surroundings, as we show here.&#160; </p>
