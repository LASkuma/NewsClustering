<p>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. &#8211; Researchers have demonstrated tiny machines 
that could make possible super-accurate sensors and motors, with 
far-reaching applications from computer storage to altimeters, detecting
 petroleum deposits to measuring DNA-binding forces.</p>
<p>The machines are called self-calibratable micro-electromechanical 
systems, or MEMS. Although MEMS are in commercial use, the new device is
 the first of its kind capable of self-calibration, a step critical for 
applications requiring high performance and accuracy, said <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/profile?resource_id=21964" target="_self">Jason Vaughn Clark</a>, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and mechanical engineering at Purdue University. </p>
<p>"Self-calibration is needed because each MEMS device is slightly 
different due to variations that occur in manufacturing," he said. 
"Small variations in microstructure geometry, stiffness, and mass can 
significantly affect performance. Because of this variability, no two 
MEMS behave identically. Since conventional methods to measure MEMS 
properties are usually impractical, expensive, have unknown accuracy and
 large uncertainty, enabling MEMS to calibrate themselves is a 
game-changing innovation."</p>
<p>Clark previously developed the self-calibration theory. He and 
doctoral student Fengyuan Li have now created the device and conducted 
experiments to validate the theory. Findings are detailed in a paper to 
appear later this year in the IEEE Journal of Microelectromechanical 
Systems, or JMEMS. </p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work received a grade of A for "innovation" and an A
 for "importance to the field," which testifies to the significance of 
the research, Clark said.</p>
<p>"I think it's important to note that in 1990 MEMS pioneer Richard 
Muller said research on the mechanical properties of the materials in 
these devices is needed to provide the engineering base that will make 
it possible to exploit fully this technology," he said. "And during a 
2007 visit to Purdue, physics Nobel laureate John Hall said that without
 accurate and precise measurements, no reliable form of science or 
engineering is possible."&#160; </p>
<p>The self-calibrating technology makes it possible to accurately 
measure displacement, or how far a measuring device moves, on a scale of
 micrometers to less than a nanometer - a range that spans a fraction of
 the diameter of a human hair to a fraction of the width of an atom.</p>
<p>"The difficulty in accurately measuring small displacements 
represents a bottleneck in MEMS and nanotech advancements," Clark said. 
"Accurate metrology is a problem that has eluded researchers since the 
beginning of MEMS and nanotech in the late 1980s. Displacement is 
fundamental to science and engineering. We know that quantities like 
velocity, acceleration, force, stiffness, frequency, and mass can be 
related to displacement. Now, using a $15 chip that can fit on your 
fingertip, we showed that our technology is able to measure MEMS 
displacements better than a $500,000 electron microscope."</p>
<p>Introducing accurate measurement methods made the difference between 
alchemy and chemistry about 230 years ago, and self-calibrating MEMS 
might bring a similar transformation in the world if nanotechnology, he 
said.</p>
<p>"The ability to perform accurate measurements is of paramount 
importance to technological advancement," he said. "In the late 1700s, 
Antoine Lavoisier transformed alchemy to chemistry by introducing 
quantitative measurements. Today, some compare the state of micro and 
nanotechnology to alchemy, where nanotechnologists can precisely sense 
small signals, but they have not had a practical way to accurately 
measure most mechanical quantities. That is, no two nanotechnology labs 
have been able to show that they can measure the same phenomenon and 
obtain the same numerical result."</p>
<p>The heart of the self-calibrating MEMS are two gaps of differing 
size, electrostatic sensors and tiny actuators called comb drives, so 
named because they contain meshing comb-like fingers. These meshing 
fingers are drawn toward each other when a voltage is applied and return
 to their original position when the voltage is turned off. The comb 
drives measure the change in an electrical property called capacitance 
while gauging the distances of the two gaps built into the device. The 
fine measurements reveal the difference between the device's designed 
layout and the actual dimensions.</p>
<p>"Once you learn the difference between layout and fabrication, you 
have calibrated the device," Clark said. "Many MEMS designs with comb 
drives can be easily modified to implement our technology. Our research 
results suggest the days of inaccurate micro and nano-mechanical 
measurements are numbered."</p>
<p>MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes currently are being used 
commercially in products such as the Nintendo Wii video game, iPhone, 
automobiles, the Segway human transporter and walking robots. However, 
those MEMS don't require ultrahigh accuracy like those used in tactical-
 and navigation-grade inertial sensors, which must undergo a complex 
calibration procedure in the factory. The chips are tested using 
machines that translate, rotate, shock, and heat the devices.</p>
<p>"The new self-calibratable MEMS could eliminate or reduce the need 
for rigorous factory calibration, cutting manufacturing costs," Clark 
said. "Something like 30 percent of manufacturing costs are related to 
calibration."</p>
<p>The self-calibratable MEMS could lead to high-performance data 
storage technologies and advanced lithography to create next generation 
computer circuits and nanodevices.</p>
<p>Researchers will use the new self-calibration approach to improve the
 accuracy of atomic force microscopes, or AFMs, which are tools 
essential for nanotechnologists. Purdue operates about 30 AFMs, and 
Clark's research group will use the calibrated MEMS to calibrate AFM 
displacement, stiffness, and force.</p>
<p>The group also will use a calibrated MEMS to measure the difference 
in gravity between different heights above the ground. The ability to 
measure gravity with such sensitivity could be used as a new tool for 
detecting underground petroleum deposits.</p>
<p>"Conventional gravity meters can cost over $200,000," Clark said. 
"They consist of a large vacuum tube and a mirrored mass. Gravitational 
acceleration is determined by measuring the drop time of the mass in 
free fall. Since oil or mineral deposits have a different density than 
surrounding material, the local gravity is slightly different."</p>
<p>The bulky and expensive gravity meters could be replaced with a small
 and inexpensive MEMS chip. Another potential application is as an 
altimeter for aircraft. Conventional altimeters measure height by using 
air pressure, which fluctuates.</p>
<p>"These altimeters aren't really accurate," Clark said. "Having a 
sensor that could accurately determine height would be an asset while 
flying at night, through fog, or bad weather. </p>
<p>The self-calibratable technology also could allow MEMS to recalibrate
 themselves after being exposed to harsh temperature changes or 
remaining dormant for long periods. </p>
<p>Yet another potential application is the study of exotic phenomena 
such as forces between molecules and within tiny structures on the scale
 of nanometers.&#160; </p>
<p>"A more accurate MEMS device could make it possible to measure 
physical phenomena that have been beyond the resolution of conventional 
technology," Clark said. "To fully understand and exploit the attributes
 of the nanoscale, you really have to be able to accurately measure 
subtle phenomena. Without accurate measurement tools, it becomes 
difficult to discover or resolve these phenomena, to develop accurate 
physical models, and to subsequently use the models to explore 
possibilities leading to useful innovations."</p>
<p>The work is based at the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue's 
Discovery Park. The research is funded by the National Science 
Foundation.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><strong>Writer:</strong> Emil Venere, (765) 494-4709, <a href="mailto:venere@purdue.edu">venere@purdue.edu</a></p>

<p class="Abstract-AUTHORS"><em>Fengyuan Li and Jason Vaughn Clark </em></p>

<p class="Abstract-TEXT">We
 present a practical method for measuring planar gaps of MEMS with comb 
drives by on-chip or off-chip electrical probing. We show that our 
method is practical, accurate, precise, and repeatable. The option of 
on-chip, postpackaged electrical measurement enables MEMS to be 
autonomously self-calibratable. We use the measurement of gap to 
determine the geometrical difference between layout and fabrication, 
which can lead to measurements of other properties such as displacement,
 force, stiffness, mass, etc. Our method consists of applying enough 
voltage to close two unequal gaps and measuring the resulting changes in
 capacitances. Many MEMS designs with comb drives can be easily modified
 to implement our technology. Our results are an order better than 
convention, and suggest means for further improvement.</p>
