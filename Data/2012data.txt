 Purdue professors discuss Greek crisis, world economy
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Three Purdue University experts discuss the Greek fiscal crisis and other world economy issues in a series of short videos available online.
 Krannert School of Management economics professors Gerald Lynch and David Hummels trace the Greek crisis to the country's decision to adopt the euro, the common European currency.
 Both say Greece probably has no choice but to abandon the euro and return to the drachma, its previous currency. Associate management professor Charlene Sullivan says the Greek crisis has put difficult burdens on its citizens, many of whom work for a government that can no longer support their jobs.
 Topics are Debt & Politics: A Look at Greece; The Euro and Greece; Greece: Economic Crisis Is Personal; The Election in France; U.S.
 and World Economic Factors; Soft Labor Markets Globally; and Market Volatility. A 20-minute podcast from Hummels, called Greece, the Euro and EU 101, is available at

 2012 drought surprises and reminds people of past, says ag historian
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The 2012 drought and its timing during the Great Recession surprised people, while reminding others of the "Dirty Thirties" and other significant U.S.
 droughts, says a Purdue University agricultural historian. "The seriousness of this drought caught people off guard, and people have forgotten how bad it can be," says 
R. Douglas Hurt, a professor and head of the Department of History who specializes in American agricultural history, especially in the West and Midwest.
 "This is a reminder that droughts are cyclical - just think about the 1930s, '50s, '80s and now today. It is going to happen again, and with climate change playing a role, it is important for farmers, policymakers, and social and physical scientists to take a page from history and have contingency plans to meet national needs.
" For example, the 1950s drought, which covered a larger area, was not as severe as the 1930s because after that decade's Dust Bowl, American farmers implemented soil conservation practices.
 The devastation in the 1930s also inspired government programs that served as a safety net in the 1950s, says Hurt, author of "The Dust Bowl: An Agricultural and Social History.
" Improved farming practices continue today with drought-resistant crops and better soil conservation techniques, but the current drought is a reminder of the damage that can be done, Hurt says.
 "People frequently ask if the Dust Bowl can happen again, and while the answer is yes, it should not happen again given the advances in agricultural science and technology," he says.
 "But we must not forget what we've learned from the past." Hurt also is the author of "The Big Empty: The Great Plains in the Twentieth Century," "Problems of Plenty: The American Farmer in the Twentieth Century," "American Agriculture: A Brief History," "American Farms: Exploring Their History," "American Farm Tools from Hand-Power to Steam-Power," "Agriculture Technology in the Twentieth Century" and "The Great Plains during World War II.".

 Students prepare to divide into teams during the 2011 Purdue Research Park Entrepreneurship Academy. Fifty Indiana high school students from 22 counties will participate in this year's academy, which culminates with a business plan competition on June 29.
 (Purdue Research Foundation photo/Cara Boyer)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Fifty Indiana high school students from 22 counties will attend the sixth annual Purdue Research Park Entrepreneurship Academy June 24-29 at Purdue University's West Lafayette campus.
 The Purdue Research Park Entrepreneurship Academy introduces high school students to the world of entrepreneurship during the weeklong program.
 Students are guided by local business leaders and Purdue Research Park experts, and they also experience campus life at a leading research university.
 During the academy, students test the viability of a business idea, identify capital needs and devise a management plan. It is based on a methodology called "So what?
 who cares? why you?®" developed by Wendy Kennedy, a technology industry executive, professor and author. For the sixth consecutive year, Kennedy will teach the methodology to the students.
 The event culminates with a business plan competition during which teams will present their capital needs and management plans to a panel of judges.
 Members of the winning team will receive tuition vouchers that are accepted at all Purdue University campuses. Officials at Purdue University's Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation program will waive one course requirement for all attendees who complete the academy.
 "A goal of the Purdue Research Park Entrepreneurship Academy is to foster entrepreneurship in young people, and our research shows that students who have graduated from the academy have a greater interest and desire to start their own company," said Joseph B.
 Hornett, senior vice president, treasurer and COO of the Purdue Research Foundation, which manages the academy. "The interest in the program has grown so much that we will be offering the program to other sites around the state including South Bend and Indianapolis.

 500 local campers find friends, life lessons through PALS program 
 Campers interact with a college student leader during the 2011 PALS (Purdue Athletes Life Success) program. This year more than 500 local youth will participate in the four-week summer camp that emphasizes friendship, positive attitude and healthy living.
 (Purdue University file photo/Mark Simons) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — More than 500 local youth will participate the next four weeks in a Purdue University summer camp that emphasizes friendship, positive attitude and healthy living.
 The 11th PALS program, Purdue Athletes Life Success program, is for children ages 8-14 who are referred by their local schools. Monday through Friday, the campers spend time at various stations to learn about sports, art, music, money management and eating healthy.
 The camp began June 13, and continues through July 13. More than 2,000 children from Tippecanoe County have participated in PALS since the first camp in 2002.
 "We don't advertise this program, and yet we have a waiting list every year," says Kim Lehnen, program co-director and operations assistant for the Department of Health and Kinesiology.
 "We often hear from parents how their children's camp experience motivates them to be active rather than just watch TV during the summer or how it evens sparks an interest to go to college some day.
 We also hear from local school administrators about how they see positive changes in some of the individual children's behavior from their camp experience.
" This year the program will place a greater emphasis on positive self-esteem and good citizenship by promoting themes related to service, fairness, kindness and courage.
 "Eleven years ago, this camp started as a sports program, but we've evolved to focus on learning life values through physical activity and other activities," says Bill Harper, camp co-director and professor of health and kinesiology.
 "Everything the campers learn is something they can practice or apply throughout their life. "We also provide a critical and positive skill set for some these children who are often at-risk for gang recruitment and other behavior problems.
 Our research from year to year shows that the positive friendships gained from camp lead to improved self-esteem, motivation to be physically active and that the children have positive attitudes toward their future.
" This year's camp activities include soccer, judo, softball, basketball, swimming, volleyball, flag football, team building games, computer skills, painting and drawing.
 The camp's stations are also spaced strategically on campus so the campers walk more than an hour each day. There also will be sessions on eating right, alcohol and drug abuse prevention, and talks by motivational speakers.
 Purdue Federal Credit Union also offers a financial literacy component for campers. The program is supported by many community and campus contributions, including the Division of Recreational Sports, which provides the fields, pool and other areas for activity stations, and Housing and Food Services, where the campers eat breakfast and lunch every day.
 Purdue University Student Health Center and many community doctors also provide free medical exams to all campers each spring. Funding for the program is partially supported by Purdue Federal Credit Union and the Brees Dream Foundation.
 Drew Brees is the former All-America quarterback for Purdue, and 2010 Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints. A portion of the proceeds from this year's inaugural 
Purdue Boilermaker Half-Marathon and 5K also will support the program. This event is Oct. 20, and more information is available at 
http://purduehalf.com/ PALS has 60 people on staff, including 24 team leaders who are current or recent college students. About a third of these team leaders are Purdue NCAA athletes or are involved in club sports.
 Six of this year's team leaders are former campers themselves, and six recent campers were selected to serve as junior team leaders.

 Abnormally hot spring weather changes crop pest dynamics
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Insects are developing early in farm fields this spring because of unseasonably warm weather, making it even more important for farmers to inspect their crops, a Purdue Extension entomologist says.
 One such insect is the Western bean cutworm, which typically feeds on Midwestern corn but also occasionally can be found in soybean fields.
 Western bean cutworm moths normally are not seen until late June and early July, but they have been showing up in pheromone traps throughout Indiana since the beginning of the month.
 There is a correlation between the record-breaking temperatures and the early insect maturation, Christian Krupke said. "Plant development was early, and insect development was also early.
 These things are both primarily temperature driven," he said. Farmers around the region need to set and keep an eye on pheromone traps to determine when they should start scouting their fields.
 When the number of trapped moths peaks (often double- and triple-digit numbers of moths per week), fields should be inspected for eggs, Krupke said.
 He advised checking pre-tassel corn and inspecting the upper side of the newest upright leaf, where eggs typically are laid. At least 100 plants should be inspected, and if 5 percent or more of the inspected plants have eggs on them, farmers should treat their fields.
 Western bean cutworm eggs are creamy-white in color at first and darken to a purplish color before hatch. They are usually laid in groups of 20-50 eggs per cluster.
 "If you don't treat early, you won't get them. Once they enter the whorl and later the developing ear, they cannot be contacted with insecticides," Krupke said.
 Growers may be seeing eggs in spotty locations already, and they will peak at the end of June. Researchers estimate that if there is one cutworm per ear of corn in a field, the farmer will lose four to six bushels per acre.
 But the insect is what Krupke referred to as a "minor pest" because, in Indiana, growers have never seen populations that high over an entire field.
 There are many insecticides labeled for this pest, and they provide excellent control if applied on time, Krupke said. But if fields remain untreated, Western bean cutworms could begin feeding on the ear.
 Ear feeding creates an "entry point" for the fungus Gibberella zeae, which causes Gibberella ear rot, explained Kiersten Wise, Purdue Extension plant pathologist.
 This particular fungus can produce a byproduct that results in increased levels of mycotoxins in the grain, leading to livestock feed refusal and reproductive problems.
 She explained that the weather conditions when plants tassel will determine whether infection will occur by this fungus. "It really depends on the environment," Wise said, adding that cool, wet weather offers prime conditions for this disease to prosper.
 More information about Western bean cutworm is available in the June 8 edition of Purdue Extension's "Pest and Crop Newsletter" at

 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University opened its ADMAgricultural Innovation Center on Wednesday (Jan.18), heralding it as offeringgreater laboratory and classroom opportunities for students in the university'stop-rated 
Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. The $4.2 million, 27,000-square-foot center was built witha $1.5 million contribution from Archer Daniels Midland Co.
, a longstandingpartner with Purdue in the education of agricultural and biological engineeringand agricultural systems management students.
 Construction of the steel-framebuilding on the south side of campus began last spring. "This building reflects the commitment and dedicationof Purdue and ADM to further enhance the experience of students in ournationally recognized undergraduate and graduate programs in agricultural andbiological engineering," said university President France A.
 Córdova. "Thisfacility will help ensure that these programs will continue to produce theinnovators that the industry needs." U.S.
 News & World Report in September rated Purdue'sDepartment of Agricultural and Biological Engineering as the best such undergraduatespecialty program in the country.
 Earlier in the year, it also ranked the graduate program as the top ABE specialty. The center, which replaces a small, outdated building,provides opportunities for students to use the largest tractors, combines andother agricultural machinery to better understand the operation of theequipment and its components, document performance and improve designs.Equipment considered small by today's standards did not fit in the previousshop.
 The space includes classrooms for students to interact insmall groups, using computers, LCD panels and writable walls so they cancomplete assignments, develop designs and build equipment in the shop area.
 There also is a conference room where students can meetwith industrial project sponsors and potential employers. "The facility provides a broad range of experiencesand opportunities for students all in one place," said department headBernard Engel.
 ADM's contribution, to be given over three years, isfunded through ADM Cares, which directs up to 1 percent of the company's pretaxprofits to initiatives and organizations that drive social, economic andenvironmental progress worldwide.

 Administrators discuss policies in place to report suspected child and sexual abuse
 Purdue administrators reiterated the importance of reporting sexual abuse and outlined protocol in place for university employees.
 Acting President Timothy Sands, Athletics Director Morgan Burke, and Vice President for Ethics and Compliance Alysa Rollock spoke Monday (July 23), the same day the NCAA released penalties imposed on Penn State due to its sexual abuse scandal and subsequent handling of the matter as detailed in the Freeh Report.
 "I think everybody has a very similar reaction," Sands said. "Your thoughts immediately go to the children, the young individuals who were the real victims.
 I think everybody is still focused on the victims. We haven’t heard the end of that, and they are not out of our minds." Sands said the university is reviewing the Freeh Report and its recommendations to learn from the Penn State incident.
 Purdue administrators outlined protocol in place to handle the reporting of suspected child and sexual abuse. "When the arrest and indictment of (former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky) first occurred (former) President France Córdova called together the leadership of the university and we discussed what we're currently doing, in particular to protect children," Rollock said.
 "We also looked at areas where we felt there are gaps and where we could improve our process." Purdue has developed and implemented an online training program that teaches how to identify, prevent and respond to sexual misconduct in various educational settings.
 The training is available online to all employees at http://www.purdue.edu/ethics/education_training.html Special measures have been taken to ensure every employee will have access to the program – whether or not they have access to a computer as part of their job responsibilities.
 To date, more than 280 service staff in physical facilities without access to computers have completed the training, Rollock said.
 Purdue already requires a background check on all new employees. A similar, interim process has been implemented for volunteers.
 "The policy requires that all volunteers be checked against both the national and state violent and sex offender registries," Rollock said, noting the policy was implemented in July.
 "We looked at all aspects of our volunteers." Burke said all outside coaches and student-athletes involved in summer camps go through two background checks before participating.
 "We have a responsibility to safeguard everyone, whether it's our student-athletes or the tens of thousands of people that come to our events annually," Burke said.
 Sands sent all staff and faculty a letter on July 20 to outline policies and reinforce processes already in place. "As a reminder, under Indiana Law, all adults are obligated to report suspected child abuse or neglect," Sands wrote in the email.
 "If you are a witness to questionable activity, you must act immediately." If any Purdue employee is witness to suspected child abuse, they should call 911 if it's an emergency.
 If it is not an emergency, the employee should alert a senior staff member and call local police, campus police or Child Protective Services at 1-800-800-5556.
 Purdue also offers a Whistleblower hotline (or 1-866-818-2620) where any potential criminal activity can be reported anonymously.
 "We want to have multiple avenues for people to report whatever wrongdoing they may suspect is occurring," Rollock said. While the protocol in place can't fully prevent a negative situation, the hope is to make sure proper steps would be taken if such an incident occurred.
 "We're hoping that those who have been educated on our policies and procedures can implement these steps and take a positive action," Rollock said.
 Burke was asked how he thought Penn State's football team would be treated by fans when visiting Purdue for a Nov. 3 game. "I think the Purdue culture is one that is a respective culture," Burke said.
 "I think our students and fans will be wise enough to realize that the young men playing in that game had nothing to do with that situation.
 Ours is a culture that does respect people."

 Adoption of advanced techniques could propel crop improvement
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Scientists could take greater strides toward crop improvement if there were wider adoption of advanced techniques used to understand the mechanisms that allow plants to adapt to their environments, current and former Purdue University researchers say.
 In a perspective for the journal Science, Brian Dilkes, a Purdue assistant professor of genetics, and Ivan Baxter, a research computational biologist for the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, argue that today's technology could allow scientists to match physiological and genetic characteristics of plants with the soil characteristics that promote or inhibit their growth.
 Making those connections could reduce the time necessary to improve plants that are coping with changing environmental and climatic conditions.
 "Evolution has solved the problems that we face in terms of adapting plants to grow in a multitude of environments," Dilkes said.
 "If we understand these processes, we'll be able to apply that knowledge to maintaining diversity in natural systems and improving and maintaining crop yield.
" The majority of a plant's makeup, besides carbon dioxide, comes from elements and minerals absorbed from the soil as the plant grows.
 The physiological and genetic mechanisms that allow plants to obtain iron from the soil, for instance, can also cause the plant to accumulate other elements.
 Understanding how those changes interact is an important piece of improving plants, Baxter said. "This is just a hint of the complexity that's out there," said Baxter, a former post-doctoral researcher at Purdue who works for the USDA at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St.
 Louis. "If we're going to make the necessary improvements in agricultural productivity, we will have to move forward with these techniques.
" Much of the work done to understand how plants have adapted to their environments focuses on one gene and one element it controls at a time.
 Pinpointing one or more genes responsible for a particular trait can take years, even decades. Dilkes and Baxter believe a wider adoption of molecular phenotyping techniques, such as ionomics and genome-wide association mapping, could allow scientists to work with multiple elements and genes at once.
 "By focusing on one gene or one element at a time, you miss out on the other physiological mechanisms occurring in the plant," Dilkes said.
 "The potential to broaden our understanding of these complex interactions and have a dramatic effect on agriculture is there." Genome-wide association mapping allows scientists to find genetic associations among multiple phenotypes, or physical traits.
 The process quickly shows which genes may be responsible for the physical characteristics. Ionomics studies the elemental composition of plants and how those compositions change in response to environmental or genetic changes.
 "Experiments with thousands of samples are now possible," Baxter said. "We've just started to put these things together." Research in Baxter's lab is supported by the National Science Foundation, the U.S.
 Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service. Most mineral elements found in plant tissues come exclusively from the soil, necessitating that plants adapt to highly variable soil compositions to survive and thrive.
 Profiling element concentrations in genetically diverse plant populations is providing insights into the plant-environment interactions that control elemental accumulation as well as identifying the underlying genes.
 The resulting molecular understanding of plant adaptation to the environment both demonstrates how soils can shape genetic diversity and provides solutions to important agricultural challenges.

 Agronomy firm integrates National Weather Service rainfall data with yield forecasting app
 LAFAYETTE, Ind. and WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Rainfall data collected by a network of radars operated by the National Weather Service will be integrated into an application that helps farmers forecast corn yields throughout the growing process.
 The Optimizer 2.0 application, developed by Advanced Ag Solutions LLC, now includes a feature that accumulates Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) rainfall data for unique fields.
 NEXRAD is a system of high-resolution Doppler weather radar stations operated by the National Weather Service. Daryl Starr, president of Advanced Ag Solutions, said integrating rainfall data into Optimizer 2.0 has been a company priority.
 "Feedback indicated that users wanted rainfall data for every field, which we now can deliver," he said. "We expected to launch the app with this feature, but we had to be certain how receptive growers would be to a site-specific yield model.
 The addition of more than 450 users since the spring 2012 launch indicated it was time to move forward with adding rainfall data.
" Optimizer 2.0 features a free daily text alert of changing yield forecasts by county. Farmers sign up for the app by going to http://www.optmzr.co
 or texting their ZIP code to 765-560-4130. Subscribers enroll their own fields to view projections by each soil type of the field.
 "Originally the weather data was derived from the ZIP code of the field," Starr said. "Although this provided unique and powerful information related to crop development across wide regions, users asked for more detailed data.
" Rainfall data collected by NEXRAD is published hourly and daily. Starr said for Optimizer 2.0 to work with the spatial rainfall data, subscribers must enroll a particular field into the system.
 The latitude and longitude information is used to pull information each day. "Optimizer helps identify locations that may have too much or too little rainfall, which can make crops suffer," he said.
 "The app suggests what is most limiting the crop yield, such as the impact from the weather, so a farmer can remedy the situation by adjusting other areas of operation.
" Although other technologies provide rainfall data for famers, Starr said he and his colleagues at Advanced Ag Solutions are looking at a bigger picture.
 "We want to help farmers make spatial decisions within the field," he said. "Rainfall data from the NEXRAD network of Doppler radars is part of the information needed.
" Advanced Ag Solutions specializes in helping high-tech, progressive farmers grow their business through precision agronomic and economic data collection, analysis and consulting.

 Algorithm, technology being developed to improve speech recognition products
 INDIANAPOLIS - An Indiana startup is developing an algorithm that may improve voice searches on computers and smartphones, help people who wear hearing aids make a better distinction between similar sounding words, and has other applications.
 Waveform Communication LLC, based in the Purdue Research Park, is developing digital code based on a model of vowel perception and production derived from cues in visual displays.
 The research was published in "The Waveform Model of Vowel Perception and Production," by Michael A. Stokes, the company's CEO. 
 "Some technology has only a 90 percent accuracy rate, which is unacceptable for the general public and professionals such as medical or court record transcriptionists," he said.
 "Some technology requires users to train on their voice or cannot recognize multiple speakers." The Waveform Model achieves 99.2 percent voice recognition accuracy and can be used by multiple speakers without special training.
 Stokes' code can be incorporated into electronic devices, and the company looks to develop a phone application within a year. "Improved voice recognition systems in electronics may open up the world for people who cannot use or do not have access to a physical keyboard," Stokes said.
 "Reducing errors in reports with highly technical language may lead to better end results for researchers and the general public.
" Waveform Communication secured $100,000 in funding from an Indiana-based venture capitalist in 2012. The company also was named one of the top 50 startups in the world by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in 2011.
 "The location by the Indianapolis International Airport is perfect for when my colleagues and partners need to travel to me," he said.
 "The technology infrastructure at the park will accommodate the company's growth, and the possibility of connecting with engineering resources from Purdue - including interns and Ph.D.
 consultations - will be invaluable." The Waveform Model is the first model that has demonstrated vowel perception at human performance levels.
 Beyond this, the Waveform Model also explains vowel production and perceptual errors. This is a complex cognitive process explained on the most fundamental level for the first time.
 Methods to improve speech in noise, speech recognition algorithm development, talker identification from waveforms, and improving hearing aids all are patent-pending.
 The successful innovation of the Waveform Model is leading to a number of application developments and is generating additional academic attention after the presentation of improved performance in 2011.
 The work will impact a number of technologies used every day and will continue to explain processes that have been studied for decades.
 The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The parks are home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.

 All 92 Indiana counties now in drought; state expecting rain
 These three Tippecanoe River fishermen thought the water level would be high enough to allow them to try out their boat while fishing July 11.
 But river levels in Carroll County were still too low to float their boat. Kaleb Shumard tows Tyler Marquie and Tucker Veldhuizen toward a favorite fishing hole through shallow waters.
 All three are from Battle Ground. (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Some level of drought now encompasses all 92 Indiana counties for the first time this year, according to the U.S.
 Drought Monitor update on Thursday (July 12). Counties in the northeast, southwest and south-central portions of the state are in extreme drought - the second-highest level.
 Parts of Vanderburgh and Posey in the Evansville area now are experiencing exceptional drought - the most intense level (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu
). The worst affected areas in the southwest are an average of 13 inches below normal in precipitation, while the areas in the northeast are 11-12 inches below normal, according to the 
Indiana State Climate office, based at Purdue University (http://iclimate.org). The position of the jet stream just north of Indiana has helped to create a dome of high heat over the state and a high-pressure system that has kept away moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, said Austin Pearson, student research assistant in the climate office.
 "We will see rain this weekend," Pearson said. "We're just waiting on the Gulf moisture to eject into the Indiana area. We could see some decent rainfall, but as of right now, this does not look like a drought-buster.
" "My concern is that some areas could get too much rain at once and we would see a lot of it run off," Pearson said. He said it would take much more than just a few storms to bring the state out of the drought, which has hindered development of crops and lowered waterways.
 "In order to bring us out of this drought, we're really going to need several sufficient rainfalls over a long period of time," Pearson said.
 "We don't want everything to come at once because that will wash everything away, and it's mainly going to be runoff - not a lot will be stored in the ground.
 "We could probably use a tropical depression or a tropical storm that will go through the Texas area and then come back up to the Midwest.
 We're just going to need to see a big pattern break if we're going to see any major rainfall." Purdue Extension has compiled farmer, homeowner and consumer drought resources at

 Alum gives named professorship gift to Engineering Education
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Geoffrey T. Crowley, a Purdue engineering alumnus, has given a $750,000 gift to the School of Engineering Education to be used for a named professorship.
 Through Purdue's Faculty Fund for Excellence, the gift from the Geoffrey T. Crowley Family Foundation will be matched dollar for dollar, bringing the total for the professorship to $1.5 million.
 "Geoff Crowley is a real champion of our school," said David F. Radcliffe, the Kamyar Haghighi Head of Engineering Education and Epistemology Professor of Engineering Education.
 "Purdue is already known as a hub of research and leadership in the growing discipline of engineering education. The new professorship that Mr.
 Crowley has funded will enable us to accomplish even more by attracting an eminent scholar who can help us continue to expand our efforts to transform how we educate engineers.
" Crowley, who lives in Appleton, Wis., is president of Northshore Leasing. He earned a bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary engineering from Purdue in 1974.
 "The need for high-quality educators grows every year," Crowley said. "The School of Engineering Education is an exceptional opportunity to make a significant contribution to incoming engineering students and have a significant impact on how we educate our future engineers nationwide.
 It is an incredible program, and we are happy to create an opportunity for an individual to make a difference." Crowley has made significant contributions to the aviation industry through consulting, marketing, customer service and quality assurance.
 In 1993 he and his partners acquired Air Wisconsin, then close to bankruptcy. They grew the airline from 12 planes and 600 employees to 86 planes, more than 3,500 employees and a route system spread throughout the United States and Canada.
 Crowley is a longtime donor to Purdue engineering. One earlier gift funds the Teaching Undergraduates for Learning Investment Program, an Engineering Education initiative to train doctoral students and postdoctoral staff in teaching engineering to undergraduates.
 The Faculty Fund for Excellence was established earlier this year to raise private gifts that will be matched by up to $7.25 million in university funds designated for faculty investment.
 The program is designed to endow new professorships. Named and distinguished professorships offer a way for the university to recognize contributions by faculty to their areas of expertise.

 Armstrong memorialized at Purdue service
 Purdue alumnus and NASA astronaut Gregory Harbaugh speaks Monday (Aug. 27) at a student-organized memorial service for Neil Armstrong.
 (Purdue University photo/Andrew Hancock) Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Neil A. Armstrong, the first human to set foot on the moon, was lauded as "an exemplary Boilermaker and an extraordinary American" during a memorial service Monday (Aug.
 27) at Purdue University. Joe Rust, president of Purdue Student Government, which organized the service, told a crowd of more than 1,000 people near Armstrong's statue at the Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering that the astronaut "inspired us to go beyond the classroom, beyond our boundaries and even challenged us to go beyond Earth.
" Armstrong, who died Saturday (Aug. 25) at age 82, earned a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Purdue in 1955. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in engineering from Purdue in 1970.
 On July 20, 1969, he became the first person to walk on the moon as commander of Apollo 11. Gregory Harbaugh, an astronaut who graduated from Purdue in 1978, said Armstrong provided valuable lessons for all the astronauts who followed him.
 "What I learned from Neil is to learn from what you encounter and prepare, prepare, prepare for anything because you never know what might happen," said the veteran of four NASA space flights, including the second Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission in 1997.
 "That's what we did on the Hubble mission. It's not that you have to be perfect every moment. We learn all along the way. Neil and all those guys set the tone, set the expectation.
" Stuart Shippee, a Purdue student in the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics who also is in the Air Force ROTC, said Armstrong is the reason he came to Purdue.
 A statue of Neil Armstrong as a Purdue student stands near the entrance of the Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering on the university's campus.

 He has inspired many people to come here. "I had the opportunity to have dinner with him on one of his visits here. He constantly encouraged me to study hard, do my best and told me that limits are made to be pushed.
 His legacy to us is that any of us, with hard work and Purdue's help, can do amazing things one day." "He was a reluctant hero, and whenever he visited Purdue, he was more interested in talking to the students about their exciting future and not his legendary past," he said.
 Other speakers at the service included Leah Jamieson, Purdue's John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering; Tom Shih, head of the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics; and John Norberg, author of "Wings of their Dreams," a book about Purdue's role in aviation history.
 The Purdue "All-American" Marching Band opened the ceremony by playing the "Purdue Hymn." As a student, Armstrong played the baritone horn in the band.
 Phi Delta Theta, the fraternity of which Armstrong was a member at Purdue, conducted a memorial ceremony, and the Purdue Glee Club closed the service by singing the national anthem as the Purdue Air Force ROTC honor guard presented the colors.
 Tributes to Armstrong also can be made at a special Purdue website, "Neil Armstrong and Purdue," by going to http://www.purdue.edu/armstrong, clicking on the "In Tribute" link and scrolling to the bottom of the page.

 August rains give relief to Indiana; drought still far from over
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Drought continued to ease in southwest Indiana in the past week as that area of the state hit hardest by the summer's drought benefited from August rains, an update of the U.S.
 Drought Monitor on Thursday (Aug. 23) showed. Some areas of southwest Indiana that had been in exceptional drought - the highest level of dryness - for several weeks improved to extreme drought, still far from full recovery but improving.
 There was some slight improvement in central Indiana, which was in less critical levels of dryness, from significant rainfall Indiana has been getting this month.
 "Most of the improvement in the drought status this past week was in the southwest," said Ken Scheeringa, associate state climatologist based at Purdue University.
 "Elsewhere, there's not a lot of change from a week ago.” Scheeringa noted that August rainfall to date in Indiana has averaged near 3.1 inches, 20 percent above normal.
 Since the start of this year, state average rainfall is about 20.1 inches. Rainfall deficits so far range from 5.8 inches across northern Indiana to 11.5 inches in the far southwest.
 The forecast for the remainder of August was for less-than-normal rainfall but above-normal precipitation in the first week of September, Scheeringa said.
 Temperatures were expected to be above normal through the period. The uncertainty of the rainfall pattern in the coming months will be compounded by land-falling tropical cyclones and their tracks, said Dev Niyogi, state climatologist.
 "Another challenge we have is to try to balance the drought designation based on the rains that will occur versus the longer-term impacts that are already under way," he said.
 The Drought Monitor map of Indiana is available at http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?IN,MW Weekly GIS maps of Indiana rainfall can be found at http://iclimate.org/precip/images/precip.asp A compilation of Purdue Extension drought resources is available at http://www.purdue.edu/drought

 August rains rejuvenate drought-stressed soybean crop
 Soybean plants typically are waist high by the end of August, but drought limited the height of plants, according to Shaun Casteel, an assistant professor of agronomy at Purdue.
 Although these plants just west of the Purdue campus in Tippecanoe County are only knee-high to Casteel, their height doesn’t necessarily translate into reduced yields.
 Casteel, an Extension soybean specialist, is optimistic that late-season rains could increase yield levels. (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell)
Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - July and August rains have come just in time to preserve some of the yield potential of much of Indiana's drought-stressed soybean crop, and more was on the way as the remnants of Hurricane Isaac moved north from the Gulf Coast.
 While the season-long drought has not yet ended, rains and a letup in record-setting heat have combined to rejuvenate the crop so much that soybean farmers in some areas of the state could still see trend, or more normal, yields, Purdue Extension agronomist Shaun Casteel said.
 But rain from Isaac over the long Labor Day holiday weekend might not be such a good thing for the crop, which could be damaged by flooded fields and wind.
 Rainfall amounts were forecast from 2 inches in the far north of the state to 7.5 inches in the south, according to the Indiana State Climate Office based at Purdue University.
 "We could see some standing water in areas of the state that have been getting rain, where soil moisture has been replenished," Casteel said.
 "Soybeans in areas of the state that haven’t had much rain can still benefit from this weekend’s rain provided it is not excessive.
" Most soybean plants are shorter than normal this year, so wind would not be as much of a factor as it would have been in other years.
 But as soybeans have recovered from drought stress, some have elongated internodes, or the distance between trifoliate leaves, and heavy pod production on the upper two-thirds of the plants.
 Those top-heavy plants would be most at risk for lodging, or stalk damage, from strong winds, Casteel said. In its August crop production report, the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture projected that Indiana soybean yields would average 37 bushels per acre, down 24 percent from the trend prediction of 48.7.
 But those estimates were based on crop conditions as of Aug. 1, and if steady rainfall continues, Casteel said there's a chance growers could make up some of the difference.
 "Late-July and early-August rains have helped soybeans retain pods, and more recent rains have helped the plants fill pods," Casteel said.
 "At this point in the growing season, we're keeping an eye on seed size." The average size of Indiana soybean seeds is 3,000 seeds per pound.
 But as it rains, Casteel said that number from this year's drought-damaged crop could notch closer to 2,500 per pound. Short plant sizes have alarmed many growers this season, but smaller plants don't necessarily equate to smaller yields.
 "Plant stature isn't a driving factor in soybean yields," Casteel said. "What's more important is having plenty of leaf area. In a more normal crop, soybean plants would have 5-6 times as much leaf area as ground area, but good yields can be obtained with leaf area that is only four times the ground area.
" Casteel was quick to point out that conditions vary by region. The U.S. Drought Monitor update of Thursday (Aug. 30), for example, showed that most of the improvement in conditions was in northeast Indiana, where the drought was downgraded from severe to moderate, the second level of dryness.
 But some counties in southeast Indiana near Cincinnati deteriorated to extreme drought, the second-highest level. "There really have been three drought scenarios in Indiana this year," he said.
 "Some areas have been dry all season long, some were dry early but then had timely rains, and other areas started out with rain but dried off late.
" In the southwestern portion of the state, farmers have experienced exceptional drought throughout much of the season and still might not see much potential to preserve yield at this point.
 In parts of the state that started out dry but then got timely rains, soybeans are progressing well. This is especially true in the north-central and the northeast.
 The southeast had rain early but then dried off. Pod retention has been a problem in those areas. Growers who do have soybeans to harvest will be able to take advantage of extremely high prices.
 Soybean futures for November 2012 and January 2013 are hovering around $17 per bushel. That's up nearly $6 per bushel from the November 2011 futures.
 With prices that high, Casteel said growers need to be doing yield estimates for grain marketing. He also said it's important for farmers to inspect plants for bean leaf beetles.
 The insect emerged earlier and at higher populations after a mild winter, which gave it time to produce a second generation that could now damage soybean yields.
 "We need to be out in the fields looking for bean leaf beetles feeding on pods, not leaves," he said. "Treatment thresholds are going to be lower this year because soybean prices are so high.
" More information about estimating soybean yields and bean leaf beetle is available in the Aug. 24 issue of Purdue Extension's Pest and Crop Newsletter at http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/pestcrop/2012/issue22/index.html

 Author, expert on global food needs to speak at Purdue
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Sir Gordon Conway, former president of the Rockefeller Foundation and an author, scholar and adviser to several governments and development agencies, will speak at Purdue on Oct.
 12 as part of the Global Food Security Distinguished Lecture. Conway, currently head of the Agriculture for Impact program at Imperial College
 in London whose new book "One Billion Hungry: Can We Feed the World?" will be published in early October, will speak at 7 p.m. in Stewart Center's Fowler Hall.
 The Purdue event, titled "An Evening with Sir Gordon Conway: Can We Feed the World?" is free and open to the public. The Distinguished Lecture is jointly sponsored by the 
Purdue Center for Global Food Security and the Purdue Climate Change Research Center in Discovery Park. "A dynamic speaker and leader, Sir Gordon Conway will share his enthusiasm for the role of science and technology in addressing the challenges of global food security with sustainable practices and strategic planning," said Gebisa Ejeta, Distinguished Professor of Agronomy at Purdue and director of the Purdue Center for Global Food Security.
 Conway poses several urgent questions for our times - how will we feed a growing global population in the face of a wide range of adverse factors, including climate change, diminishing land, water and energy resources?
 And what can the social and natural sciences, joining with governments and industry, do to find lasting solutions? He has served as adviser to several agencies, including the Chicago Council for Global Affairs, the World Food Prize Foundation, the Royal Geographical Society and the United Kingdom's Department of International Development.
 In the early 1960s, while working in Sabah, North Borneo, Conway became a pioneer of integrated pest management. He joined Imperial College in 1970, forming the Centre for Environmental Technology in 1976.
 During the 1970s and 1980s, he lived and worked extensively in Asia and the Middle East, as well as for the Ford Foundation, World Bank and USAID.
 Educated at the Universities of Wales (Bangor), Cambridge, Trinidad and California (Davis), Conway's discipline is agricultural ecology.
 He was named a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George in 2005 and is a deputy lieutenant of the County of East Sussex.
 Led by Ejeta, the Purdue Center for Global Food Security was launched in Discovery Park in 2010 to take up one of the world's most pressing challenges: getting enough food to people who need it the most today and producing enough to meet even greater future demands.
&#8232;&#8232; Ejeta, a native of Ethiopia, received the 2009 World Food Prize for his work in developing sorghum varieties resistant to drought and the parasitic weed Striga.
 His research dramatically increased the production and availability of sorghum for hundreds of millions of people in Africa, where it is a major crop.

 Body heat, fermentation drive new drug-delivery 'micropump'
 This diagram shows a new type of miniature pump activated by body heat that could be used in drug-delivery patches powered by fermentation.
 The micropump works by harnessing the pressure generated by fermenting yeast. Such drug-delivery patches might use arrays of "microneedles" to deliver a wider range of medications than now possible with conventional patches.
 (Purdue University image/Manuel Ochoa)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Researchers have created a new type of miniature pump activated by body heat that could be used in drug-delivery patches powered by fermentation.
 The micropump contains Baker's yeast and sugar in a small chamber. When water is added and the patch is placed on the skin, the body heat and the added water causes the yeast and sugar to ferment, generating a small amount of carbon dioxide gas.
 The gas pushes against a membrane and has been shown to continually pump for several hours, said Babak Ziaie, a Purdue University professor of electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering.
 Such miniature pumps could make possible drug-delivery patches that use arrays of "microneedles" to deliver a wider range of medications than now possible with conventional patches.
 Unlike many other micropumps under development or in commercial use, the new technology requires no batteries, said Ziaie, who is working with doctoral student Manuel Ochoa.
 The robustness of yeast allows for long shelf life, and the design is ideal for mass production, Ochoa said. "It would be easy to fabricate because it's just a few layers of polymers sandwiched together and bonded," he said.
 Findings were detailed in a research paper published online in August in the journal Lab on a Chip. The paper was written by Ochoa and Ziaie, and the research is based at Purdue's 
Birck Nanotechnology Center in the university's Discovery Park. The "the microorganism-powered thermopneumatic pump" is made out of layers of a rubberlike polymer, called polydimethylsiloxane, which is used commercially for diaphragms in pumps.
 The prototype is 1.5 centimeters long. Current "transdermal" patches are limited to delivering drugs that, like nicotine, are made of small hydrophobic molecules that can be absorbed through the skin, Ziaie said.
 "Many drugs, including those for treating cancer and autoimmune disorders cannot be delivered with patches because they are large molecules that won't go through the skin," he said.
 "Although transdermal drug delivery via microneedle arrays has long been identified as a viable and promising method for delivering large hydrophilic molecules across the skin, a suitable pump has been hard to develop.
" Patches that used arrays of tiny microneedles could deliver a multitude of drugs, and the needles do not cause pain because they barely penetrate the skin, Ziaie said.
 The patches require a pump to push the drugs through the narrow needles, which have a diameter of about 20 microns, or roughly one-fourth as wide as a human hair.
 Most pumps proposed for drug-delivery applications rely on an on-board power source, which is bulky, costly and requires complex power-management circuits to conserve battery life.
 "Our approach is much more simple," Ziaie said. "It could be a disposable transdermal pump. You just inject water into the patch and place it on your skin.
 After it's used up, you would throw it away." An online Purdue Difference Makers feature about Ziaie is available at http://www.purdue.edu/differencemakers/ziaie.html
 Note to Journalists: A copy of the research paper is available by contacting Emil Venere, 765-494-4709, venere@purdue.edu We present a microorganism-powered thermopneumatic pump that utilizes temperature-dependent slow-kinetics gas (carbon dioxide) generating fermentation of yeast as a pressure source.
 The pump consists of stacked layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and a silicon substrate that form a drug reservoir, and a yeast-solution-filled working chamber.
 The pump operates by the displacement of a drug due to the generation of gas produced via yeast fermentation carried out at skin temperatures.
 The robustness of yeast allows for long shelf life under extreme environmental conditions (50 °C, >250 MPa, 5-8% humidity). The generation of carbon dioxide is a linear function of time for a given temperature, thus allowing for a controlled volume displacement.
 A polymeric prototype (dimensions 15 mm x 15 mm x 10 mm) with a slow flow rate of <0.23 mL min-1 and maximum backpressure of 5.86 kPa capable of continuously pumping for over two hours is presented and characterized.

<Content>
 Brantley Gilbert will perform at Purdue with Uncle Kracker, Greg Bates and Brian Davis
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The Brantley Gilbert "Hell on Wheels Tour," with special guests Uncle Kracker, Greg Bates and Brian Davis
, will perform at Purdue University's Elliott Hall of Music at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 27. This performance is presented by the Purdue Convocations
 and the Purdue Student Concert Committee. Brantley Gilbert was born and raised in the small town of Jefferson, Georgia, near Athens.
 It is that upbringing and small-town influence that Gilbert credits toward allowing him to cultivate his unique sound. Gilbert's taste in music always swayed toward a southern country rock feel, but his true-to-life testimony of heartache, trials, triumph and success found a home in country music.
 He began his career playing acoustic sets in hometown venues, but he soon noticed that his audience had more interest in his rock-infused country music.
 In the past five years on the road, Gilbert has built his brand through his compelling lyrics and a dynamic live show. His fans now call themselves the BG Nation.
 Their enthusiasm led him to Nashville, where he soon signed with Warner/Chappell Publishing and released his debut album on an independent label, "A Modern Prodigal Son.
" On March 16, 2010, his sophomore album, "Halfway to Heaven," peaked at No. 2 on the iTunes Country Album Charts, and at No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers Album Chart for all genres.
 It has remained on the charts for 112 weeks. "The Best of Me," a song from Gilbert's first album, was recorded by country superstar Jason Aldean and earned a spot on his iTunes release "Wide Open.
" Then, in August 2010, Brantley's "My Kinda Party," became a No. 1 smash for Aldean, as well as the title tract to Aldean's platinum-selling album.
 The superstar's latest single, "Dirt Road Anthem," was also written by Gilbert. In February 2011, Gilbert signed with Big Machine Label Group's The Valory Music Co.
, and scored a Top 40 country radio hit. His current hit "You Don't Know Her Like I Do" sits at No. 3 after 30 weeks on the charts.
 Uncle Kracker Uncle Kracker had a busy 2011 as part of Kenny Chesney's road tour and also headlining his own shows. The Detroit-based singer-songwriter's 2010 release "Happy Hour - The South River Road Sessions," featured his singles "Smile" and "Good To Be Me" which featured guest vocals by Kid Rock.
 Initially known for his role as DJ in Kid Rock's legendary Twisted Brown Trucker band, Uncle Kracker made a stunning solo debut with 2001's "Double Wide" album, which went 2 times platinum in sales.
 Greg Bates Born and raised in Nashville, Bates is a true product of Music City, motivated not by the trappings of country-music stardom, but by the reward of a well-written lyric.
 The 24-year-old singer, guitarist and songwriter, is poised to release his self-titled major-label debut on Republic Nashville. Inspired by traditional 90's artists like Randy Travis, Dwight Yoakam and Alan Jackson, he soon found that some of the songs he heard on the radio were composed by his classmates' moms and dads.
 He attended Belmont University to study music, but it was always the story of the song that fascinated him. His intense work resulted in his first 10-song album which includes "Go Time," his first single "Did It for the Girl," and the explosive "I'm on It.
" Brian Davis was raised in the Carolinas between the Saturday night honkytonks and the Sunday morning steeples, surrounded by fields, farms and everything in between that makes country, country.
 You can hear it in his voice and the way he bends the strings on his telecaster. But there is also a side to him that, along with his country roots, has brought the mass appeal and extensive fan base that he now enjoys - his diverse love of music.
 From Matchbox-Twenty to Waylon to Counting Crows to Hank to Dwight Yoakam to Bob Marley to Garth to AC/DC to Tom Petty, it's all packed into his music.
 Davis' five studio albums are the fuel for his live shows, encompassing everything from heartbreaks to good times, tailgating to fishing, first times to last times.

 Calling on students: Make the Call
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University students and staff are rolling out a new online video, "Make the Call," to explain alcohol poisoning and urge everyone to call for help when someone is in a life-threatening situation after drinking.
 The video also explains the Indiana Lifeline law and Purdue medical amnesty policy, both designed to protect individuals from legal or disciplinary action when they call for help.
 "The Indiana Lifeline law and Purdue's medical amnesty policy were set in place by students for students," said Joseph Rust, president of Purdue Student Government.
 "Students' well-being comes first, and that's what this video is conveying. It's telling students 'Make the call. Get help. Save a life.
'" The video, available at http://www.purdue.edu/makethecall, depicts a student who has alcohol poisoning and how his friends make the decision to call for help.
 It includes commentary from Dana Wislocki, a Purdue paramedic, and Jeffery Stefancic, the associate dean of students in the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities.
 "Previous data showed the primary way that students responded to alcohol poisoning was to monitor a person who had passed out," said Tammy Loew, health advocacy coordinator for the Student Wellness Office.
 "This was disconcerting because a person's blood alcohol concentration can continue to rise even while he or she is passed out. Even after a person stops drinking, alcohol in the stomach and intestine continues to enter the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body.
 It is dangerous to assume the person will be fine by sleeping it off. "The most important response is to make the call and get the victim medical attention.
 Students also needed to know that the university and legal system will support their decision to get medical attention." Purdue Fire Chief Kevin Ply, whose paramedics respond to calls for help, says critical signs of alcohol poisoning include any of the following:
 If alcohol poisoning goes untreated, Ply says, it can result in several life-threatening situations, such as: Untreated severe dehydration from vomiting can cause seizures, permanent brain damage or death.
 Even if the victim lives, an alcohol overdose can lead to irreversible brain damage. Rapid binge drinking is especially dangerous because the victim can ingest a fatal dose before becoming unconscious.
 "This video is a collaborative effort involving several campus partners, including students," Loew said. "We're pleased that the information is now readily available in one location, and we hope that student groups of all sorts watch it and spread the word.
 "While we hope they never need it, students will find the information they need to save a life."

Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Campus Technology magazine is recognizing Purdue as an international campus technology innovator for Hotseat, Mixable and DoubleTake, three mobile applications that bolster engagement inside and outside the classroom using technology already integral to students.
 The annual awards recognize higher education institutions for initiatives in educational technology that are models for other schools.
 Purdue has won six of the awards since 2006, all for technologies developed by Purdue's IT staff. Purdue is among 10 award winners for 2012 selected out of 354 nominations from higher education institutions worldwide.
 The winners are highlighted on CampusTechnology.com and will be featured at the magazine's Campus Technology 2012 conference July 16-19 in Boston and in its July print edition.
 Gerry McCartney, Purdue's vice president for information technology, chief information officer and Olga Oesterle England Professor of Information Technology, says IT organizations have reached a point where they must become innovators instead of builders, and Purdue's mobile applications result from that mindset.
 "We have been able to make the transition from builders to innovators at Purdue not just because we have many smart and creative people - that's true of nearly every university campus - but because we've been able to create an environment focused on innovation," McCartney says.
 "For example, when we released Hotseat, our classroom discussion tool, we had our own ideas about how a faculty member might use it.
 But we've found that faculty are using it to engage students in ways that never occurred to us. When people invest their own creativity into a technology to make it better, that's a great sign that the technology truly is innovative.
" Hotseat uses student comments and a Twitter-like forum to enhance classroom discussion. Suddenly, every student can comment in class and may do so without interrupting the lecture's flow.
 Mixable connects students to their classmates by allowing them to create online study groups and share class materials automatically and securely on Facebook.
 DoubleTake is a mobile video system that allows students to capture, share and watch videos from virtually anywhere using their smartphones.
 The DoubleTake system also includes a Web interface where videos can be uploaded in various formats and shared with others, including instructors, or the world.
 Kyle Bowen, director of Informatics, the IT team that created the applications, says modern technology, including mobile technology and social media, is changing how business is done in almost every area.
 "But before now, classrooms have not benefited from these changes," Bowen says. "Through partnering with creative faculty members, Purdue is developing a portfolio of technologies for classrooms that engage students and contribute to their success.
 We see this award as validation for the concept of technology's role in the classroom as well as recognition of the innovative work of the team.
" Bowen says Purdue is negotiating with McGraw-Hill on a licensing agreement to deliver Hotseat to the global education market. Licensing of some of the other applications is anticipated.
 "Purdue's suite of mobile applications has harnessed the power of social media and mobile technologies to boost engagement, collaboration and student success, all within an educational context," says Andrew Barbour, executive editor of Campus Technology.
 "We are also impressed by the university's efforts to share its innovations with the higher education community." This is the fourth year in a row Purdue has won at least one of the awards.
 The 2011 awards were for Signals, an early warning system that helps students succeed in their coursework, and HUBzero, a web-based platform allowing researchers to collaborate using computational models to study complex problems.
 The 2010 award was for the Community Cluster Program, a cooperative effort with faculty members to build supercomputers that now rank Purdue's research computing resources in the top five nationally among academic institutions.
 The 2009 award was for DiaGrid, a distributed computing system in which Purdue and partners on other campuses link idle computers in offices, student computing labs and elsewhere together for major research jobs.
 Purdue also won in 2006 for its visualization and virtual reality facility, the Envision Center for Data Perceptualization. Writer:

 Caterpillar gets more from its food when predator is on the prowl
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Animals that choose to eat in the presence of a predator run the risk of being eaten themselves, so they often go into a defensive mode and pay a physical penalty for the lack of nutrients.
 While other animals increase metabolism and stop growing or developing during a defensive period, hornworm caterpillars slow or stop eating but actually keep up their weight and develop a little faster in the short term.
 Ian Kaplan, a Purdue University assistant professor of entomology; Jennifer S. Thaler, an associate professor of entomology at Cornell University; and Scott H.
 McArt, a graduate student at Cornell, noticed that hornworm caterpillars ate 30 percent to 40 percent less when threatened by stink bugs but weighed the same as their non-threatened counterparts.
 "It was a little puzzling. If you're going to shut down, there should be a cost associated with that," said Kaplan, who studied the caterpillars as a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell.
 "We usually think that you can either grow really fast and not defend yourself, or defend yourself but pay a physical penalty. That wasn't happening here.
" Threatened hornworm caterpillars adapt to increase the efficiency by which they convert food into energy. They also increase the amount of nitrogen they extract from their food and their bodies' lipid content.
 In the first three days of the study, the caterpillars weighed the same and reached the next developmental stage faster than caterpillars eating in safety.
 Over the long term, however, their body compositions change and their ability to turn food into energy is reduced in later developmental stages.
 The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, reveal that hornworm caterpillars are the first insect species shown to delay the physical penalties associated with protecting themselves from predators.
 Hornworm caterpillars eat tomato, tobacco, pepper and other crops. Kaplan said understanding their physiology may lead to better ways to control the pests.
 Kaplan said the scientists found an interesting way to work around a major roadblock in studying the physiological changes in the caterpillars exposed to predators.
 They "disarmed" the predators. Stink bugs normally would use their mouthparts to stab the caterpillar and suck out its internal parts.
 But the scientists removed part of the stink bugs' mouthparts, allowing them to hunt but not eat. "We created a predator that couldn't kill its prey," Kaplan said.
 "It was a way to be able to expose the prey to a risk and still be able to study the physiological responses of the prey." The scientists also wondered whether the physiological responses were due to the presence of the predator or simply from a lack of food.
 To test, they removed food from some caterpillars that had eaten as much as a caterpillar facing a predator. Other caterpillars were given food off and on until they had eaten the same amount as one facing a predator to better mimic those same feeding patterns.
 In both cases, the caterpillars weighed less and did not exhibit the same physiological changes as their hunted counterparts. "This is a predator response rather than a physiological response due to a lack of food," Kaplan said.
 Compensatory Mechanisms for Ameliorating the Fundamental Trade-off Between Predator Avoidance and Foraging Most organisms face the problem of foraging and maintaining growth while avoiding predators.
 Typical animal responses to predator exposure include reduced feeding, elevated metabolism and altered development rate, all of which can be beneficial in the presence of predators but detrimental in their absence.
 How then do animals balance growth and predator avoidance? In a series of field and greenhouse experiments, we document that the tobacco hornworm caterpillar, Manduca sexta, reduced feeding by 30–40% owing to the risk of predation by stinkbugs, but developed more rapidly and gained the same mass as unthreatened caterpillars.
 Assimilation efficiency, extraction of nitrogen from food, and percent body lipid content all increased during the initial phase (1-3 d) of predation risk, indicating that enhanced nutritional physiology allows caterpillars to compensate when threatened.
 However, we report physiological costs of predation risk, including altered body composition (decreased glycogen) and reductions in assimilation efficiency later in development.
 Our findings indicate that hornworm caterpillars use temporally dynamic compensatory mechanisms that ameliorate the trade-off between predator avoidance and growth in the short term, deferring costs to a period when they are less vulnerable to predation.

 Charcoal rot invades soybean fields, resembles drought stress
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Charcoal rot of soybeans is one of the few Indiana field crop diseases thriving in the extreme heat and exceptional drought, and it could reduce the yields that have otherwise survived the unusual weather.
 Charcoal rot is caused by a fungus and infects seedlings early in the growing season. Symptoms, which mimic drought stress, aren't likely to appear until mid-season or later.
 "Charcoal rot will be hard to diagnose in years like 2012, since it is difficult to distinguish it from symptoms of general drought stress," said Kiersten Wise, Purdue Extension plant pathologist.
 "Plants on hillsides or sandy areas will typically exhibit symptoms first." While there are no in-season treatments to control charcoal rot, Wise said it's important that soybean growers scout for the disease and know which fields are susceptible.
 "The fungus can infect a number of crops, including corn, which limits the effectiveness of tillage and rotations for managing disease," she said.
 Growers should look for plants exhibiting symptoms similar to drought stress, such as wilting, yellowing and stunting of the plant.
 Because a large portion of soybeans are drought-stressed, Wise said, growers need to pull some of those plants and split the lower stems to look for a gray discoloration, and dark, round fungal structures called microsclerotia.
 "We need to know which fields have charcoal rot this year so we can manage it in future crops," she said. "Genetic resistance in soybean varieties is limited but may be available, so producers with confirmed fields of charcoal rot should work with seed dealers to select less-susceptible varieties.
 They also should avoid planting at high populations to reduce competition for water among plants." Wise also said it's important to note that foliar fungicides are ineffective at preventing or reducing charcoal rot development.
 More information about charcoal rot is available in Purdue Extension's Pest and Crop Newsletter at http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/pestcrop/2012/issue16/index.html#scout
 Growers also can find a compilation of drought resources at Purdue Extension's "IN Drought" website at http://www.purdue.edu/drought

 China's 'Billy Graham' to speak at Purdue
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Noted Asian philosopher and evangelist Stephen Tong will speak at Purdue University several times from Sept.
 14 -16. Tong is often referred to as the "Billy Graham of the East" because of the impact of his ministries throughout Asia. His visit to Purdue is sponsored by the Purdue Chinese Biblical Forum and Fellowship, Bridges International, Faculty Commons, 
Christian Faculty Staff Network, and Purdue Chinese Christian Fellowship. Each event is free, open to the public and will be presented in Mandarin to specifically serve Purdue's Chinese students and faculty members.
 The events at Loeb Playhouse are open to the entire community and English translation will be offered. Tong will teach in English a seminar for faculty and graduate students called "The Error of Contemporary Culture" at 10 a.m.
 Saturday (Sept. 15) at Upper Room Christian Fellowship, 2234 Indiana Trail Drive in West Lafayette. Tong will hold a question-and-answer session that night at 6 p.m.
 and an evangelistic rally at 7:30 p.m., both at Stewart Center's Loeb Playhouse. He will speak at rallies at Loeb Playhouse at 7 p.m.
 Friday (Sept. 14) and 6:30 p.m. Sunday (Sept. 16) Tong's father died when he was 3, leaving his mother to raise several children during the World War II Japanese occupation.
 The family fled to her native Indonesia in 1949 during the Chinese Revolution when he was 9. In 1957 his mother sent him against his will to a Bible seminary youth conference.
 At age 17 he rejected Marxism, embraced Christianity and has been preaching ever since. Four of his brothers are also ministers.
 Tong's oratory has been compared to Charles Spurgeon and George Whitfield. He composes hymns in three languages, conducts orchestras and designs churches.

 Chinese delegation to visit Purdue, Indianapolis
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation will sponsor a visit to the state by a high-level delegation from China's Ministry of Commerce.
 The 20 officials provide guidance to large Chinese companies looking to invest and expand outside China. "This is a high-powered group sponsored by the central government that can have a big influence on where new investment goes," said Mark Van Fleet, Purdue's executive director of global business engagement who is coordinating the visit.
 "Indiana is fortunate to be hosting the delegation." Besides Indiana, the delegation's only other U.S. visits will be to New York City and California's Silicon Valley.
 The delegates will arrive in Indianapolis Wednesday (July 25). On July 26, they will spend the day in Indianapolis hearing from IECD and representatives of the auto, energy, bioscience, agriculture and logistics industries.
 On July 27, they will be in Columbus, where they will visit Cummins. In French Lick on July 28, they'll hear about that region and spend time at the resort.
 They will spend July 29 and 30 in Greater Lafayette where they will meet Purdue officials and tour Purdue Research Park, Purdue Discovery Park and the Nanshan aluminum plant which is under construction on the south side of Lafayette.
 "Nanshan is the perfect example of how Purdue and Indiana links to China can bring investment into our communities," Van Fleet said.
 Lijun Du, president of Nanshan America Co., earned a master's degree in industrial administration from Purdue.

 City works with Purdue to create high-tech traffic-control system
 Darcy Bullock, from left, a Purdue professor of civil engineering, and former postdoctoral research associate Edward J. Smaglik, discuss information provided by detection equipment at an "instrumented intersection.
" The research aims to improve the safety and efficiency of traffic flow. (Purdue News Service file photo) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University engineers have worked with the city of Lafayette, Ind.
, to create a new "Advanced Transportation Management System," a network of sensors, computers and software to efficiently control traffic signals and reduce congestion.
 The system is one of the first deployments in the country of new traffic signal management techniques developed at Purdue, said 
Darcy Bullock, a professor of civil engineering and director of the Joint Transportation Research Program at Purdue. It allows engineers to attack traffic jams on two fronts: Determine more precisely how to adjust the length of green signals to better match traffic volumes, and synchronize signals in series on busy roads so that motorists catch green lights in sequence.
 "We have all been at intersections where the green light did not last long enough for all the traffic to pass through and then seen drivers on the opposing side of the intersection get too much green time," Bullock said.
 "What we are doing enables electronic signal controllers to collect data that can be used to effectively alter this timing to better manage traffic flow.
" "The ultimate goal is to allow the majority of the traveling public to spend less time stopped at a signal when it is red," she said.
 "Other potential benefits are improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions because less time idling reduces fuel usage and the associated emissions.
 Having fewer starts and stops also reduces fuel consumption and emissions." The system is integrated into signal controllers that are widely used at intersections across the country and uses specialized software algorithms.
 Data are displayed on a main computer in the city's traffic center, allowing personnel to monitor information and make a change to individual intersection timing.
 "It is like a dashboard for signal systems," said Neal Carboneau, implementation manager for the Joint Transportation Research Program.
 "You could equate it to the leap from horse-drawn carriages to commercial aircraft. In the past, you had to manually count vehicles and time their progression through the corridors.
 You'd have to come back to the office and do calculations, then return to the signal to make adjustments to improve the flows. Then, in order to verify that the changes were effective you would need to go through the same procedure again.
 As you can imagine, it was a very inefficient and time consuming process." Recent advances in technology, including improvements to the reliability and speed of Internet access, as well as greater computer storage and processing ability, have made it practical to use computerized systems that operate signals.
 "Induction loops" in the pavement near signals indicate that a vehicle is in the turn lane and other locations. These loops, which are ubiquitous in U.S.
 cities, are connected to a computer in a cabinet at each intersection. Algorithms in the system use mathematical equations and data from the loops and other sensors to determine whether an intersection's traffic volume is exceeding its capacity, tracking traffic during each cycle of green-amber-red.
 The resulting information is plotted on graphs that show how many vehicles are unable to get through an intersection before the signal turns red.
 Such data enable the system to identify needed changes to signal timing to facilitate the flow of traffic and also to synchronize signals.
 "How often have you driven down a corridor and had it go green, green, green, green?" Bullock asked. "The answer is, not very often.
 The problem is that until now we have not had good measurement tools needed to create patterns of sequential green signals." The system incorporates new "traffic signal performance measures," criteria based on research on traffic flow that enable computers to identify the need for signal timing optimization.
 The performance measures were developed at Purdue in collaboration with the National Cooperative Highway Research Program and the Indiana Department of Transportation
 "We've married some theory with new data collection practices, performance measures and modern IT technology to come up with a better tool for making decisions about signal management," Bullock said.
 Loop detectors are used in combination with the new algorithms to upgrade standard electronic controllers, the brains of traffic-signal systems at intersections.
 "The system has been installed and is operational, but since it is the first of its kind, getting it to be fully functional will take some time," said Fred Koning, foreman in the Lafayette Traffic Department.
 Having a centralized system is helpful in troubleshooting the network, which is made up of numerous signals and computers and a web of electrical cables and sensors, Koning said.
 "Several other states and local agencies across the country are considering modeling their system specifications based upon the system in Lafayette," Carboneau said.
 The project has involved about a dozen Purdue faculty, staff and students from the School of Civil Engineering "The Indiana Local Technical Assistance Program
 supports research and helps transfer technology from research to implementation in line with Purdue's strategic plan for discovery with delivery," Carboneau said.
 "They were integral in their support of the research and facilitation of the dialogue between the city, industry and Purdue, assisting in the system's development and operation.
" Jay Grossman, a project engineer, and others from Elkhart County, Ind., assisted the research, and provided guidance in the development of specifications used in the procurement of the system.
 Elhart County is in the process of bringing a similar system online. Recently receiving a Merit Award for the new system from the American Council of Engineering Companies were Miller, Koning and Thomas Vandenberg from the engineering firm Butler, Fairman and Seufert Inc.
 Previous research has been funded by the Indiana Department of Transportation. A portion of that earlier work, on State Road 37 in Noblesville, Ind.
, yielded data indicating a potential 20 percent decrease in travel time for drivers. Findings from a recent report about the Noblesville research show that optimizing signal timing resulted in an estimated annual cost savings of $472,817, with a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 197 tons per year showing the financial and environmental benefits of using systems and processes such as these.
 "Not only are there benefits in improving he efficiency of the local agency's personnel, but there are also benefits that decrease the travel time, vehicle cost and emissions of the traveling public," Carboneau said.

 Civil Engineering building to be named for alumnus
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The Purdue University civil engineering building will be named for alumnus and donor Delon Hampton and his mother, Elizabeth Hampton.
 The naming of the Delon and Elizabeth Hampton Hall of Civil Engineering is subject to approval by the Board of Trustees, which meets Friday (July 20).
 Delon Hampton, who has made a $7.5 million gift to the School of Civil Engineering, earned a master's degree in civil engineering from Purdue in 1958 and a doctorate, also in civil engineering, in 1961.
 He received an honorary degree from Purdue in 1994. "Dr. Hampton has a deep and longstanding commitment to Purdue," said Timothy Sands, the university's acting president and Basil S.
 Turner Professor of Engineering. "Naming the building in the Hamptons' honor is an appropriate recognition and will serve as an ongoing tribute to his generosity and leadership.
" Hampton of Potomac, Md., is the founder of Delon Hampton & Associates (DHA), a top design firm specializing in civil, structural and environmental engineering, and construction and program management and planning services.
 He was a civil engineering assistant professor at Kansas State University and a professor at Howard University. While on leave from Kansas State University, he served for a year as head of soil dynamics research at the University of New Mexico's Eric H.
 Wang Research Facility in Albuquerque. He has received the Edmund Friedman Professional Recognition Award and James Laurie Prize from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the Distinguished Engineer Award from the National Society of Black Engineers.
 He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He is a past president of ASCE.
 During his tenure, he proposed the creation of ASCE's Outstanding Projects and Leaders (OPAL) Award, which was approved by the board and has been given each year since 2000.
 Hampton has served as a director of the Greater Washington (D.C.) Board of Trade, as a Malcolm Baldrige Award overseer for the U.S.
 Department of Commerce, and as a treasurer and director with the Center for National Policy. The civil engineering building was constructed in three phases.
 The original building was constructed in 1950, with the second phase added in 1961 and a final phase in 1986. "Dr. Hampton's gift will allow the School of Civil Engineering to build on its long history of success," said Leah Jamieson, the John A.
 Edwardson Dean of Engineering. "He is among the school's extraordinarily successful graduates, and it's fitting that the Hampton name will be an integral part of Purdue civil engineering.
 "It also shines a light on Purdue's longstanding commitment to diversity," she said, noting that the School of Civil Engineering had the first Purdue engineering African-American graduate in 1894.

 College students balance academic success with grief, ill parents
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Even though losing a loved one or being away from a seriously ill parent is common for college students, many can feel isolated when balancing school and family issues, says a Purdue University professor who specializes in grief and loss issues.
 "Many students are not comfortable talking with their peers about grief or family illness because they don't want it to define them, and, as a result, these students are often balancing stress and sadness on their own," says Heather Servaty-Seib, counseling psychologist and an associate professor of educational studies.
 Statistics show that 40 percent of college students are grieving a death within the last two years, and the number of students with chronically or terminally ill parents is not tracked.
 Servaty-Seib's research with grieving college students has indicated that students dealing with grief often struggle academically, particularly during the semester of their death loss.
 Whether it's a family death or serious illness, students may have to cope with stresses such as feeling guilty for being away from home or related financial issues connected to a family illness.
 "Balancing the role as academic-focused student and the child of someone who is very ill is not easy," Servaty-Seib says. "Often, well-meaning parents don't communicate about the illness or daily problems to their children because they are protecting them.
 Sick family members often request that the student stay at school and focus on being a student. But then the student is at school worrying.
 And when the student is home, then they are worried about academic challenges." Colleges and universities are recognizing the importance of supporting students in these situations through official grief absence policies and student groups.
 Servaty-Seib says more can be done. "Purdue is just one of a few schools with a policy that supports students who have a death in the family," she says.
 "At a large institution, like Purdue, a policy or student group makes a tangible difference for students who are struggling with grief or family illness.
" Purdue's policy served 480 students last year by helping them take an official leave of absence for funeral services and making arrangements for missed classes or coursework.
 The formal absence policy also was an opportunity for the Office of the Dean of Students to offer individual counseling resources to the grieving students, says Lou Ann Hamilton, assistant dean of students.
 The office also hears from students who need assistance or counseling when they have a parent who is chronically or terminally ill.
 "We see many students struggle when a parent is ill," Hamilton says. "They are forced to grow up faster when they need to be home on weekends to help care for a sick parent or younger siblings.
 It is very hard on them and can affect their success as a student." Starting this fall, Purdue also is home to one of the few dozen college chapters of Students of Ailing Mothers & Fathers Support Network.
 "Every student chapter is unique to its college campus, but in their own way they provide support and help normalize the experience these students are going through," says Servaty-Seib, the group's adviser at Purdue and member of the mental health board of the 
National Ailing Mothers & Fathers Support Network. "A positive of this group is channeling grief through actions. Taking action, such as organizing a fundraiser, can be powerful for people who don't want or need to talk about their grief.
 It will be interesting to see how this student-driven group takes shape on campus."

 Company to develop commercial replacement for leaded general aviation gasoline
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. and SIOUX FALLS, S.D. - Professionals in the aviation and energy sectors have formed a company to scale up production of a high-octane, unleaded, sustainable general aviation gasoline and bring it to market.
 Swift Fuels LLC was created in partnership between Swift Development Renewable Fuels LLC and South Dakota-based RMB Energy LLC. Rob Broin, head of RMB Energy, is the interim CEO and Jon Ziulkowski from SDRF is COO.
 Swift Fuels LLC is based in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette. Broin said Swift Fuels will be responsible for developing a market for 100SF, the company's unleaded general aviation gasoline.
 "This includes completing the approval of 100SF by ASTM International and the Federal Aviation Administration for use in all airplanes currently fueled by 100LL, and beginning immediate production of 100SF for testing and commercial use," he said.
 Ziulkowski said Broin has a proven track record in the alternative energy arena through his nearly two decades as a principal of Broin and Associates Inc.
, which is now part of POET LLC, one of the nation's largest ethanol manufacturers. Broin held the positions of president and CTO at Broin and Associates.
 "With the added strength of Rob's vision and expertise, we can finally realize the vision for lead-free general aviation fuel that sustained Swift through many past challenges," Ziulkowski said.
 "We can all see a very tangible path to success for 100SF." "I was blessed to have played a role in establishing an industry that is responsible for reducing America's demand for foreign-sourced liquid motor fuel with a renewable product," he said.
 "In Swift Fuels we have a similar opportunity to replace an environmentally hazardous leaded product with a synthetic, high-performance, renewable fuel.
" "With the publication of ASTM D7719 in May 2011, the industry is taking a proactive, forward-thinking approach to resolving the issues present with leaded general aviation fuels before the government is forced to impose a regulatory solution," he said.
 "Additionally, we are receiving tremendous cooperation from the FAA on our Cessna 172 Supplemental Type Certificate program." Established in 2012, 
Swift Fuels was created in partnership between Swift Development Renewable Fuels LLC and South Dakota-based RMB Energy to scale up production of a high-octane, unleaded, sustainable general aviation gasoline and bring this fuel to market.
 Swift Fuels builds on the aviation fuels technology created by Swift Enterprises Ltd. The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The parks are home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.

 Conference examines woody biomass production, challenges
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A conference sponsored in part by Purdue University will address issues related to growing and harvesting hardwood trees for cellulosic biofuels.
 Woody Biomass in Indiana takes place Sept. 26-27 at Clifty Falls State Park in Madison. The registration deadline is Sept. 21 and includes one- and two-day attendance options.
 A field tour of biomass harvesting at Southeast-Purdue Agricultural Center in Butlerville on Sept. 28 comes with both registration options.
 "This conference will address the potential of both native- and plantation-grown woody biomass in the central Midwest as a source of renewable energy," said Dan Cassens, a professor of wood products in Purdue's Department of Forestry and Natural Resources and a conference organizer.
 "Management techniques to maintain site quality and minimize impact on wildlife also will be discussed. The intended audience is professional and industry foresters and wildlife managers, as well as all commercial companies and policymakers who are interested in renewable energy sources.
" Those attending on Sept. 26 can choose from two half-day concurrent conference tracks. A "Managing Central Hardwoods for Biomass Harvesting" track includes sessions on best management practices, forest management, harvesting impacts and Southeast-Purdue biomass research projects.

 Continued dry weather takes its toll on Indiana forage crops
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana's forage crop yields aredown and won't likely improve without decent rainfall in the near future,prompting a need for growers to take precautions to avoid further crop loss,says a Purdue Extension forage specialist.
 Forages initially were damaged during hard freezes inApril and have struggled to yield amid the unrelenting hot, dry weather of Mayand June.
 "Many producers have reported to me that their firstcutting was reduced fairly substantially as compared with other years - down by25 percent or more," Keith Johnson said.
 "So we're starting out in adeficit in terms of total-season hay production possibilities. Then we couplethat with the dry weather and the next harvest doesn't look to be superhigh-yielding either.
" The April freezes damaged alfalfa tillers and, as aresult, not only was the first cutting reduced, but if harvested prematurelythe crop could have been lacking in carbohydrate reserves needed for the nextcrop to regrow.
 Harvesting second and subsequent cuttings before the plantshave time to rebuild vigor could cause stands to suffer into the future.
 Johnson recommended waiting until just after late bud oron into some flowering before harvesting alfalfa. "If we've harvested relatively early a couple oftimes, we really have put some stress on that plant," he said.
 "Weprobably should give it an opportunity to get beyond late bud and maybe intosome flowering to give us more days to put carbohydrates into the reserves inthe crown and taproot.
 Then there should be enough vigor for regrowth." In addition to delaying harvest a bit, Johnson also saidnow is a good time to look at soil fertility.
 Soil tests can reveal anynutrient deficiencies and help producers know which fertilizers need to beapplied. But Johnson cautioned producers against applying nitrogenin hay and grass-dominant pastures until there is enough moisture.
 "I think we have to recognize at this point moistureis the yield-limiting need," he said. "I would hold off on nitrogenfertilizer application until we return to the more timely and sufficient rainswe need for grass production to occur.
" The lack of rain also has created conditions thatexaggerate potato leafhopper damage. The insect feeds on alfalfa and many otherplants.
 During feeding, it injects the crops with toxins that stunt growth andlimit yield. Johnson encouraged growers to scout for the potatoleafhopper with a sweep net intended for this pest.
 Insecticide treatmentscould be warranted when the average number of potato leafhopper in a singlesweep of the net is 0.1 leafhoppers per inch of alfalfa height.
 For example, an alfalfa crop 10 inches tall would needmore than one leafhopper per sweep to warrant control. Those insecticides,however, also kill beneficial insects.
 A better option, Johnson said, is for growers to plant aleafhopper-resistant variety the next time they seed the field. Finally, growers need to pay attention to harvest dates toavoid harvesting forage crops too late in the season.
 "If enough stresses occur, growers really need to beaware of when they harvest the last crop," Johnson said."Traditionally, for those in the northern part of the state, somewherearound Sept.
 5 should be the last growing-season harvest. For those in southernIndiana, we probably can stretch that to around Sept. 15. "This allows enough time to build those carbohydratereserves before a killing freeze comes along, so we have a plant with a full tankof energy through the course of winter.
 And then, as we break dormancy thefollowing year, enough reserves are there for a vigorous break winter dormancycrop."

 Corn silage could salvage some value for drought-damaged crop
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Farmers with drought-damaged cornfields could consider harvesting the crop for livestock feed to salvage some of its value and to help livestock producers supplement short forage supplies, says a Purdue Extension forage specialist.
 Damaged corn can be harvested as either whole-plant silage or green chop, but, either way, growers and livestock producers need to be aware of how it can affect feed quality and animal health.
 "Feeding value of drought-stressed corn is influenced by several factors but in general is higher than expected," Keith Johnson said.
 "Most studies indicate feed value of drought-stressed corn to be 80-100 percent that of normal silage." Purdue University studies showed little or no difference in feedlot gain or milk production when beef and dairy cattle were fed normal or stressed corn silage.
 But, as a rule, Johnson said drought-stressed corn will have slightly more fiber and less energy, but 1-2 percent more protein than normal silage.
 "Ideally, the crop should contain 60-70 percent moisture at harvest," Johnson said. "For upright silos, to avoid seepage, growers should harvest at 60-65 percent, whereas for bunker silos, harvesting at 65-70 percent moisture will result in better packing and storage qualities.
" He said producers often tend to harvest the damaged crop too soon, meaning silage has too much moisture, which can result in poor fermentation and ultimately lower feed value.
 Stalks of plants with brown leaves and stalks with small ears or little grain content will be higher in moisture. "A quick way to determine if the plant contains too much moisture is to hand-squeeze a representative sample collected from the forage chopper," Johnson said.
 "If water drips from the squeezed sample, the corn is too wet for ideal fermentation." Livestock producers using drought-damaged corn for silage need to make sure they have the feed tested for nitrate.
 Nitrate levels can be higher in drought-damaged corn. While the potential for nitrate toxicity after fermentation is recuded, Johnson said it’s still a good idea to have the feed analyzed.
 Producers with short pasture and stored feed supplies might also consider harvesting drought-damaged corn as green chop. "There are two major concerns with this practice," Johnson said.
 "One is the potential for nitrate toxicity and the second is the potential to founder animals." Animals with founder, or laminitis, have an inflammation of the soft tissue around the hoof bone that can cause permanent damage to the foot.
 * Feed green chop in small quantities throughout the day, rather than large quantities once per day. * Take extra precautions during the first 2-3 days following rain because nitrate levels tend to increase during this period.
 "As plants mature, nitrate levels decline, so animals become acclimated and the chances for toxicity decrease over time," Johnson said.
 Corn growers looking to sell drought-damaged corn for silage, and livestock producers looking to purchase it, need to understand how to properly price the crop.
 Because yield varies widely based on moisture content, Johnson said moisture content will greatly affect pricing. Before growers make any decisions about what to do with drought-damaged corn, Johnson said it is imperative that they check with crop insurance agents so the crop can be appraised for damage prior to harvest.
 He also noted that herbicides and insecticides applied to the corn crop throughout the season have feeding restrictions. Growers need to pay close attention to herbicide and insecticide labels and be in touch with chemical suppliers to make sure the crop is harvested and fed safely.

 Cover crops help retain nitrate, prepare for future crops
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Drought-decimated corn crops are likely to leave residual nitrate in soils after harvest, making this year ideal for farmers to plant cover crops, says a Purdue Extension agronomist.
 Cover crops can "scavenge" residual nitrate and recycle it through biomass. The process helps reduce nutrient loss through leaching and runoff, and makes some of those nutrients available for the next cash crop.
 "This year is a great example of when a cover crop is needed to trap the much larger amount of residual nitrate that will be present after the poor corn crop," said Eileen Kladivko, Purdue University professor of agronomy.
 "Farmers who lose residual nitrogen also are losing the opportunity to trap that nitrogen and keep it in their fields for subsequent crop use.
" According to Kladivko, cover crops will benefit individual farms by building soil organic matter and potentially reducing next year's nitrogen application.
 The practice also benefits regional water quality. Although much of the Midwest is still in drought, rain has returned to many areas.
 With rainfall, residual nitrate will leach out the bottom of the root zone along with other essential nutrients. Those nutrients end up in local waters and eventually in the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.
 Kladivko expects the amounts of nitrate lost to be much larger than usual this year. She said numerous studies have shown the highest nitrate losses in drainage waters following dry years.
 Cover crops also can help farmers recoup part of the nitrogen fertilizer they applied to fields this season and provide benefits for future growing seasons.
 Poor cash crop yields equal less crop residue being returned to the soil. Cover crops can offset some of that loss by protecting against soil erosion and providing food for soil organisms.
 As the cover crops decompose during the next year, some of the nitrate taken up will be released back into the soil for use by the next cash crop, and some nitrate will help build soil organic matter.
 The amount of nitrate uptake this fall and the amount of release next season depends on several factors, such as the amount of residual nitrate in the soil currently, the type of cover crop, the amount of growth this fall or spring if it's a winter-hardy cover crop, the stage of cover crop at termination time and the decomposition rate of the cover crop in the spring.
 While most farmers think of using cover crops after corn, they also can be useful after soybeans. As with cornfields, cover crops can add organic material and trap nitrate released by decomposing soybean residues.
 Although the amount of nitrate taken up by cover crops is difficult to predict, Kladivko said it could be 50-100 pounds of nitrate per acre in a drought year.
 The amount released to next year's crop also is hard to predict, but it could potentially be up to half of the nitrate in the aboveground biomass if the cover crops are terminated while in the vegetative state and they have a low carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.
 Kladivko recommended planting cover crops such as oats, cereal rye, annual ryegrass or oilseed radish if the primary objective is to scavenge nitrate and build organic soil matter.
 If producers want to do fall grazing, she recommended planting turnips or crimson clover mixed with oats and cereal rye. Whichever cover crop is planted, farmers need to plan for their future cash crop in the spring.
 Planning for cover crop termination is essential if the additional crop is to be beneficial and not hinder the planting of the next crop.
 The Midwest Cover Crops Council has additional resources and tools to help farmers select and plant cover crops at their website,

 Crisis Center earns first Purdue Community Partner Award
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue has named the Lafayette Crisis Center as the inaugural winner of the university's Exemplary Community Partner Award.
 The award was established to recognize local organizations that provide opportunities for Purdue students to enhance their educational experience through volunteer and service-learning activities.
 It carries a $1,000 cash prize. This selection was determined by a panel representing leadership of the Boiler Volunteer Network, Engineering Projects in Community Service, College of Liberal Arts Engagement and Community Relations.
 Ten not-for-profit organizations were nominated by Purdue faculty and staff. According to the nomination "the Crisis Center provides students practical job skills including communication and problem-solving.
 The communication skills learned by the students through their training gives them an opportunity to listen and hear not only what is said, but what isn't, and then they must strategize on how to help those in need.
" The nominators also point out that the Crisis Center serves not only as a place for voluntary activity, but also is a place students can call on when they are in need of support and information.
 Jane McCann, Crisis Center executive director, said the organization has a long history with Purdue. "Since our founding by graduate students in clinical psychology in the early 1970s, our telephone hotlines have been answered by caring and trained Purdue students.
 Without the commitment and skills of over 85 Purdue student volunteers each year, we wouldn't be able to maintain our 41-year history of responding to every call for help.
" "The Crisis Center gives us an opportunity to make a difference in the world," said Rachel Feltman, a Purdue student and center volunteer.
 "I have been told that my experience at the Crisis Center will be extremely helpful when I enter the workforce. It shows responsibility, compassion, loyalty, ability to handle high-stress situations, respect for people and a willingness to work for something greater than ourselves.
" Other organizations nominated for the award include the Columbian Park Zoo, Almost Home Humane Society, Hanna Community Center, West Lafayette Public Library, Humane Society of Indianapolis, Food Finders Food Bank, Lafayette Adult Resource Academy, Wabash River Enhancement Corporation and Tumaini Street Drop-in Center in Eldoret, Kenya.

 Crop production report, MyPlate exhibit featured Aug. 10
 Purdue Extension will offer the news media both a hard-news story connected to the drought and a feature story about how to maintain a healthy diet Friday, Aug.
 10, at the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis: Agricultural experts will analyze the U.S. Department of Agriculture's crop production report, 
the first yield and production forecasts for the 2012 U.S. and Indiana corn and soybean crops, for what it means to farmers, consumers and the economy.
 While the first projections of the season are always highly anticipated, that will be the case even more so this year because of the effects of widespread drought on crops.
 Panelists are Shaun Casteel, Purdue Extension soybean specialist; Chris Hurt, Purdue Extension agricultural economist; Joe Kelsay, director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture; Greg Matli, Indiana deputy director of the National Agricultural Statistics Service; and Bob Nielson, Purdue Extension corn specialist.
 Jay Akridge, Glenn W. Sample Dean of Purdue Agriculture, will moderate discussion. Connie Weaver, distinguished professor and head of the Department of Nutrition Science in Purdue's College of Health and Human Sciences, will be available for interviews in which she will explain the significance of Purdue Extension's exhibit "To MyPlate and Beyond.
" Weaver's calcium and nutrition research is used to set recommendations for calcium for populations worldwide. Her research was used to help set the USDA dietary guidelines that are the science behind MyPlate.
 The MyPlate interactive exhibit illustrates the five food groups that are part of a healthy diet: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins and dairy.
 The exhibit features tips and ideas on how to build a healthy plate of food.

 'Curiosity' brings Purdue professor, alumni into Mars mission
 Artist's concept of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Curiousity rover (NASA/JPL-Caltech)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Three Purdue University alumni and a professor are part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission, which early this morning landed the Curiosity rover on the planet's surface.
 Purdue alumnus Douglas Adams, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory parachute cognizant engineer, helped design, build, test and deliver the parachute decelerator system on the Mars Science Laboratory, or MSL, spacecraft.
 Testing of the parachute, which at 130 pounds is the largest ever used outside Earth's atmosphere, took place in the world's largest wind tunnel.
 The tunnel could hold a 737 jet, but couldn't quite contain the parachute, which peeked out one end of the tunnel, Adams said. "Being next to something so massive that is moving so quickly gave me an understanding of how an ant must feel when a foot comes to step on it," he said.
 "The parachute had to be robust because it faced grueling conditions. Here on Earth, a parachute begins to slow an object as it is being deployed, but on Mars the entry vehicle hardly slowed at all until the parachute fully opened.
 It had to hold up to a very sudden onset of tremendous force." Artist's concept of Mars Science Laboratory entry, descent and landing.
 (NASA/JPL-Caltech)Download Photo The parachute was designed to generate up to 65,000 pounds of drag force, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
 Adams also helped develop the mortar deployment system, which he describes as basically an enormous cannon that shot out the parachute.
 "The mortar had to fire very precisely as the spacecraft traveled at 900 mph, and any delay of even a half a second would have had a significant effect on targeting," he said.
 "As with many of the various teams' hardware and systems for MSL, if it had failed, it could have ended the mission. We only had one chance.
" Adams said he nervously watched the data with other scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory during the landing event. "The tension in the room was palpable as every person there had invested a significant portion of their life in getting Curiosity to Mars," he said.
 "When the sky crane maneuver was completed and we got the 'Tango Delta Nominal' call, for touchdown nominal, the atmosphere changed to a chaos of jubilation.
 It was incredible. A once-in-a -lifetime experience." Adams is a low-density supersonic decelerator parachute systems engineer and soil moisture active passive dynamics and systems engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
 He earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Purdue in 1994, 1996 and 2001, respectively. Purdue alumnus Eugene Bonfiglio, a NASA mission design engineer in the entry, descent and landing guidance and control system group, helped test and prepare the on-orbit contingency plan for the MSL that would have been enacted if a launch failure left the spacecraft orbiting Earth.
 Bonfiglio helped determine ways to control the spacecraft's fall back to Earth so that it would have landed safely in the Pacific Ocean.
 He also was involved in performing system tests that helped fine tune the software used to control the spacecraft during its entry, descent and landing.
 Prior to this mission, most of Bonfiglio's work was related to trajectory and navigation and involved computer simulations. He said he is most looking forward to the measurements from MSL's actual entry, descent and landing.
 "As hard as we try, any testing that we do here on Earth to understand aerodynamic interactions that occur during entry and landing will never perfectly simulate the conditions that are actually experienced when flying through the Martian atmosphere," Bonfiglio said.
 "Not only is this data priceless, but we will get more of it than ever before and it will go a long way in helping us better understand what is actually happening to the vehicle.
" Bonfiglio earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Purdue in 1997 and 1999, respectively. Another Purdue alumnus, JPL senior technologist Behcet Acikmese, was responsible for developing and delivering algorithms vital for the flight guidance, navigation and control system's "fly-away phase" of the landing, where the sky crane was diverted from the rover after it touched down.
 "My controller flew the sky crane about 650 meters away from the rover to a safe distance," said Acikmese, who will become an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin this fall.
 He earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering in 1996 and a doctoral degree in 2002 in aeronautics and astronautics, both from Purdue.
 Steve Schneider, a Purdue professor of aeronautics and astronautics, evaluated the heat shield that protected the MSL spacecraft when it entered the Martian atmosphere.
 The heat shield is the largest ever built for a Mars mission. Schneider was on a review board for the thermal protection system.
 Input from the review led to a change in the heat shield material, he said. "The heat generated on entry depends on the weight of an object relative to its size and this was the largest, heaviest probe ever landed on Mars," Schneider said.
 "This heat shield faced a very different scenario from past missions, and its engineering was quite complicated. This was the first Mars mission to use a heat shield made from PICA, which can handle a much higher temperature than previously used materials.
" As the MSL plowed through the atmosphere of Mars, which is 100 times thinner than that of Earth, the heat shield was estimated to reach 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
 The Curiosity Mars rover will function as a mobile laboratory to investigate the current and past environment of Mars' Gale Crater to determine if it is or ever was capable of supporting life.
 It is equipped with 10 science instruments and a robotic arm that can drill into rocks, scoop up soil and deliver samples to internal analytical instruments.

 Curiosity's first Martian 'steps' enabled by student's iPhone app
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - NASA engineers training this summer to drive the Mars rover Curiosity were continuously stymied by having to spend several minutes entering arcane code before every maneuver.
 Intern Riley Avron, 19, a Purdue University sophomore from Los Angeles, solved the problem by custom designing an iPhone app that makes driving a one-ton robot as easy as a toy remote control car.
 "They were spending so much time with their face buried in a computer that they couldn't pay attention to the rover's progress through the simulated Mars landscape - the real reason they were out there," Avron said.
 "With the iPhone it was quick and easy, and they could really learn what the rover was capable of doing." Avron recently returned to Purdue to pursue his studies, but the engineers at the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena still use his app regularly to drive Curiousity's earthbound twin Scarecrow through tough maneuvers on JPL's simulated Mars landscape.
 "If the scientists want Curiosity to go through a crater, over a rock or along a ridge, then engineers absolutely have to know if it can do it without rolling over or getting stuck," Avron said.
 "After all, there's no AAA tow truck to call for help up on Mars." Avron has completed three internships at JPL, beginning when he was still a student at North Hollywood High School.
 He is not sure if he will return though – the electrical engineering student has other frontiers to conquer. He has several high-tech business startup plans in the works.
 "Where else other than college can I start a business, take the risk of possibly seeing it fail, and then be concerned only with what's next?
" Avron said. Note to Journalists: Photos of Riley Avron are available upon request as is video of him driving a Mars rover. For more information, contact Jim Schenke, Purdue News Service, at 765-237-7296,

 Cutting livestock greenhouse gases requires effort from rich and poor countries
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Regulating livestock greenhouse gas emissions could shift livestock production to unregulated, less developed countries unless those poorer nations can be enticed to preserve their forested lands, according to a Purdue University economic study.
 Agriculture and deforestation account for about one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, with methane from livestock production being the most important type of farm-related emission.
 Alla Golub, a Purdue research economist at the Center for Global Trade Analysis in Purdue's Department of Agricultural Economics, Thomas Hertel, a Purdue distinguished professor of Agricultural Economics and executive director of the Global Trade Analysis Project, and Benjamin Henderson, livestock policy officer at Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations modeled policies aimed at reducing emissions from livestock.
 "Emissions from agriculture have not gotten as much attention as those from fossil fuels combustion. But when the world gets serious about tackling climate policy, livestock will be an important part of that discussion," Hertel said.
 "Livestock sectors are the most important contributors to non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions and would be seriously affected if a tax or regulations were implemented.
" Their findings, with co-authors from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Electric Power Research Institute and Ohio State University were published in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They showed that wealthy countries alone would have limited success in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production because it would give poorer countries, with greater greenhouse gas emissions intensities, an incentive to expand production.
 "In this case, we would likely see continued expansion of pasture and cropping area in regions like South America as agriculture encroaches on forested lands," Golub said.
 "This negates greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the wealthy countries." This led Golub, Hertel and their co-authors to examine what might happen if emission regulations in wealthy countries were paired with incentives to retain forested land in poorer nations.
 Without new grazing areas, those poorer countries would not expand their livestock production as much. "Indeed, this combination of policies is quite effective at preventing 'emissions leakage' to developing countries while enhancing forest carbon stocks in the lower-income regions," Hertel said.
 The effect, however, would be less meat available for consumption in the poorer countries and a price increase globally. "Just like a fossil fuel emissions tax would raise prices for energy, this would have an impact on agricultural prices," Hertel said.
 This unwanted impact on livestock consumption and production in poorer countries could be reduced by designing an appropriate policy, the authors found.
 Their study shows that wealthier countries could provide a subsidy that requires poorer countries to protect forested lands and shift to cleaner technologies, which would support those countries' output and consumption while reducing emissions.
 Purdue's Global Trade Analysis Project model was used for the study. The Food and Agriculture Organization provided funding for the research.
 Alla A. Golub, Benjamin B. Henderson, Thomas W. Hertel, Pierre J. Gerber, Steven K. Rose, and Brent Sohngen Recent research has shed light on the cost-effective contribution that agriculture can make to global greenhouse gas abatement; however, the resulting impacts on agricultural production, producer livelihoods, and food security remain largely unexplored.
 This paper provides an integrated assessment of the linkages between land-based climate policies, development, and food security, with a particular emphasis on abatement opportunities and impacts in the livestock sector.
 Targeting Annex I countries and exempting non-Annex I countries from land-based carbon policies on equity or food security grounds may result in significant leakage rates for livestock production and agriculture as a whole.
 We find that such leakage can be eliminated by supplying forest carbon sequestration incentives to non-Annex I countries. Furthermore, substantial additional global agricultural abatement can be attained by extending a greenhouse gas emissions tax to non-Annex I agricultural producers, while compensating them for their additional tax expenses.
 Because of their relatively large emissions intensities and limited abatement possibilities, ruminant meat producers face the greatest market adjustments to land- based climate policies.
 We also evaluate the impacts of climate policies on livelihoods and food consumption in developing countries. In the absence of non-Annex I abatement policies, these impacts are modest.
 However, strong income and food consumption impacts surface because of higher food costs after forest carbon sequestration is promoted at a global scale.
 Food consumption among unskilled labor households falls but rises for the representative farm households, because global agricultural supplies are restricted and farm prices rise sharply in the face of inelastic food demands.

 Dairy Digest turns 100 with rhyming podcast
 Tamilee Nennich and her colleagues publish a weekly "Dairy Digest" podcast as a resource for both dairy producers and consumers.
 The podcast's 100th episode aired this week. (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – A popular Purdue Extension dairy podcast has turned 100 with a fun, rhyming episode to commemorate the milestone.
 "Purdue Dairy Digest" is a free, weekly podcast series created by three Purdue University animal scientists that covers a range of topics directed at dairy farmers, as well as information for a more general audience.
 Since its inception on June 16, 2010, the podcast has covered hot topics, such as breeding, animal health, grazing, milk quality, milk prices and farm management.
 The 100th episode features Purdue Extension dairy specialists Tamilee Nennich and Mike Schutz giving a rhyming, two-minute summary of the past two years.
 It, along with the entire series, is available at http://www.ansc.purdue.edu/dd/ and also is a featured podcast on iTunes. "One thing that's nice is that we're able to cover a lot of topics, from transition cow issues and milk quality to harvesting forages and feed prices," Nennich said.
 "We range from very broad topics to very specific topics." While the 100th episode is a celebration, Nennich said there are plenty of more serious topics slated for the coming weeks.
 "Milk prices declined over the past few months, but we still have high feed prices, so we will be highlighting ways to manage that situation," she said.
 With Indiana in the midst of the most serious drought since 1988, Nennich also said coming episodes will focus on strategies to help producers manage their farms as efficiently as possible.
 Phil Reid, Purdue animal sciences distance education coordinator, also is a Dairy Digest contributor.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Dairy farm succession planning will be a key focus as Indiana and Kentucky dairy producers, nutritionists and support industry professionals come together for the fifth annual Kentuckiana Dairy Exchange near Shelbyville, Ky.
 The conference and farm tours will run from 1 p.m. July 31 to noon Aug. 1. Program attendees will visit five dairy operations in Kentucky and hear presentations from Purdue University faculty.
 On the evening of July 31, Angela Gloy, Purdue farm business planning specialist, and Kelly Heckaman, a Purdue Extension educator, will give a presentation on planning for the next generation of dairy farmers.
 "We have a lot of dairy producers nearing retirement," said Tamilee Nennich, Purdue Extension dairy specialist. "That's sparking questions from farmers wondering how to split their assets and adequately plan for the next generation.
" Nennich said the exchange also will offer farmers an opportunity to learn about new techniques in the industry and meet and share ideas with other farmers in the area.
 This year, farmers will see and learn about compost bedded pack barns, a type of housing facility not common in Indiana. The dairy tours also will feature a farm that extensively uses alternative feeds and operations that use sand-bedded freestall barns in their production.
 The Kentuckiana Dairy Exchange is an annual event organized in a collaboration among Purdue, the University of Kentucky and Indiana Dairy Producers.

 DeBoer: Farmland property taxes to continue rising into 2015
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Farmland owners are in for more property tax increases at least into 2015, Purdue Extension agricultural economist Larry DeBoer says.
 In the Jan. 27 issue of his column "Capital Comments," DeBoer said the base rate for the assessment of an acre of farmland will jump from $1,290 in 2011 to $1,500 in 2012.
 He estimates the base rate will be about $2,030 per acre by 2015. The 2007 base rate was $880. Indiana farmland is assessed based on its use value rather than its market value - a practice not uncommon among other states.
 For example, farmland that borders commercial or residential development is not assessed based on selling price but rather only on the income it can earn from farming, DeBoer said.
 When determining property taxes, the government uses a formula that takes into account the base rate, productivity factor and influence factor.
 The productivity factor is based on soil productivity for growing corn. Subtracted from that for some acreage is an influence factor, which is a percentage reduction in the dollar amount based on conditions such as frequent flooding, grade or forest cover.
 Changes in the assessed value come into play because of the way the base rate is calculated each year. Indiana's assessed values change each year based on several factors, including land rents, commodity prices, costs and interest rates.
 Increasing land rents, high commodity prices and low interest rates have combined to create a trend of increase. That means the base rate for 2011 was based on figures from the years 2002-07.
 The base rate for 2012 was calculated from the years 2003-08. Because corn and soybean prices in 2002 were relatively low and interest rates were high, those numbers combined to help keep the average lower in 2011's assessments.
 Now the numbers from 2002 have been replaced with the high commodity prices and lower interest rates of 2008, resulting in an increase in assessed value.
 "Here's where a new quirk in the formula comes in. The Department of Local Government Finance drops the highest value of the six from the average," DeBoer said.
 "The General Assembly changed the formula for 2011 taxes to make the increases in the base rate a little smaller." For 2011 taxes, lawmakers dropped the highest value derived from the 2007 data.
 But because the 2008 data is higher, it will be dropped, leaving the still-high values of 2007 to factor into the 2012 tax assessments.
 "Without dropping the highest value, the base rate for 2012 taxes would have been $1,670," DeBoer said. "The calculation change reduced the base rate by about 10 percent.
" Because there is a four-year lag in the formula and all of the data from 2009 and 2010 and most from 2011 are available, DeBoer said it is possible to project what will happen to the base rate for the next few years.
 The Department of Local Government Finance used data from 2004-2009 for the 2013 calculation of $1,630, DeBoer said. Because commodity prices have remained high and interest rates low, the base rate for taxes in 2014 will be about $1,760.
 For taxes in 2015, it will be about $2,030. The six-year average and four-year lag also mean the high commodity prices and low interest rates in 2012 will first enter the tax formula in 2016 and will not drop out until 2022.
 "The base rate is likely to increase and remain high for a long, long time," DeBoer said. DeBoer's full column, along with the podcast version, are available on the Web at http://www.ag.purdue.edu/agcomm/pages/Newscolumns.aspx Source: Larry DeBoer, 765-494-4314, ldeboer@purdue.edu

 Delaware County program wins Purdue award
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — TEAMwork for Quality Living, a life skills program that serves Delaware County, has received the 11th annual Purdue University Inspiring Families and Building Communities Award.
 The award, given by the College of Health and Human Sciences, honors organizations that have directly impacted a community and have improved the well-being of Indiana families.
 TEAMwork will receive $1,500 cash and a certificate. Two other programs, Blackford County's Silver Lining Opportunity Store and Johnson County's Club Exito (Esperanza En Jesucristo Ministries), also were recognized and will receive $400 each.
 TEAMwork for Quality Living is a grass-roots nonprofit organization that matches trained allies from the middle class who serve as intentional friends and accountability partners to families living in poverty in Delaware County.
 Each small group, led by the person leaving poverty, focuses on developing plans for education and employment and moving toward life goals.
 In the Blackford County program, families earn Silver Lining coupons when they participate in family-oriented programs, such as Born to Learn, Healthy Families, WIC, Extension and Early Head Start.
 The coupons are then redeemed at the Silver Lining Opportunity Store for children's items. The store is funded through grants and donations and is run by volunteers.
 Club Exito is an ESL Family Literacy Program for Spanish-speaking families in Johnson County. Once a week, a bus picks up families from their homes and takes them to school so they can read or do homework with their children while volunteers assist.
 Additional volunteers organize activities for toddlers during this time. After the homework session, children participate in volunteer-led games, songs and reading while parents have an English lesson taught by an ESL teacher and a health lesson taught by a registered nurse.
 Families end the session by sharing with each other what they have learned. Sources: Denise M. Buhrmester, director of communications for the College of Health and Human Sciences, 765-496-3663,

 Designer fertilizer producer joins Purdue Research Park
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Farmers who cultivate corn, peanuts, potatoes, rice and soybeans could increase harvest yields using nutrients designed by an agricultural technology research company and licensed to fertilizer manufacturers.
 Agtec Innovations Inc., which has offices in Los Altos, Calif., and Kolkata, India, designs specialty fertilizers based on its Smart Micronutrient technology.
 The company has become a tenant in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette. Smart Micronutrients are patented, environmentally friendly, slow-release fertilizers based on designer molecules.
 Company CEO Murli Varadachari said these molecules mimic the natural form of micronutrients in the soil. "These molecules also mirror the plant root-activated release of nutrients that allows for sustained nutrient availability," he said.
 "This has resulted in sharp increases in crop yields during extensive field trials." During field trials, Agtec Innovations' fertilizers increased yield over the control group in cabbage, corn, peanut, potato, rice and soybean crops at one-fifth to one-tenth of the recommended dosage.
 They also increased the yield over the control group in black gram, green gram, red cabbage and red lentil crops. Varadachari said the fertilizers are environmentally friendly and leave no pollutants or residues.
 "These fertilizers consist entirely of plant nutrients. There are no pollutants or residues left behind when they are used, and they do not leach or drain away from soil," he said.
 "We have found that they also slow the rate of soil degradation over time." Agtec Innovations commercializes the technology by licensing the intellectual property to fertilizer manufacturers.
 "Because Smart Micronutrients are insoluble, they have numerous potential applications including combining them with nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizers and coating them on NPK fertilizers and seeds," Varadachari said.
 "Manufacturing them is a relatively simple process that requires easily available, low-cost starting materials." Varadachari said Agtec Innovations' affiliation with Purdue Research Park will strengthen the company.
 "It is great to be associated with Purdue University, which is at the forefront of agricultural research. The affiliation also helps us to reach out to Purdue faculty who may be interested in testing and research," he said.
 "The facilities and support offered by the Purdue Research Park will be particularly useful for us to make Smart Micronutrients a commercial success.
" Agtec Innovations is an agricultural technology research company designing and producing a range of specialty micronutrient fertilizers based on Smart Micronutrient technology.
 The company licenses the technology for Smart Micronutrients to fertilizer manufacturers around the world. Smart Micronutrients can be produced in a range of standard or customized formulations to suit different crop, soil and agro-climatic conditions.
 The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The park network is home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.

 Despite drought, pumpkin crop looks strong and healthy
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana's pumpkin crop for the most part has fared well despite the drought that has gripped the Midwest, and consumers should have an abundance of healthy pumpkins to choose from this autumn.
 Initially, there were fears that the crop would not germinate properly because of the drought and heat, said Dan Egel, a Purdue Extension plant pathologist.
 But the pumpkins did germinate, and the dryness actually protected them from many of the diseases that afflict them in wetter years.
 The most important diseases this year have been viruses, which have been more prevalent than normal, though not prevalent enough to be severe.
 Virus diseases cause a mosaic or dimpled pattern on the leaves and uneven ripening in the fruit, Egel said. "Usually, the fruit will go ahead and ripen and turn orange, but there might be green patterns mixed in with the orange, or maybe some dimples that you can run your hand over and feel.
" Egel added that this variegation normally does not affect a pumpkin's carving quality. "Personally, I think the patterns caused by virus give the pumpkin individuality.
 Mild virus symptoms shouldn't affect the marketability of pumpkins." Most American consumers buy pumpkins either to carve for decoration or to eat.
 Edible pumpkins, known as pie or sugar pumpkins, are typically smaller than a volleyball, but Egel advises consumers to ask their sellers if they are not sure which kind of pumpkin they are buying.
 "For either type of pumpkin, I would run my hands over it to make sure there aren't any soft spots on it," Egel said. "Knock the dirt off and check carefully because a pumpkin with soft spots would definitely be one to pass on.
 You don't want that sitting on your porch." A healthy pumpkin's stem should be as full and green as possible, rather than thin and brown.
 A green stem indicates a fresher pumpkin that was likely grown in the area. The color of the pumpkin itself, however, is up to the consumer.
 "The neat thing about pumpkins is that they're all different, and you can pick one that suits your taste," Egel said. "You can pick white ones, yellow ones.
 I knew a little boy who came in and chose a nice green pumpkin. It's just what looks good to the consumer."

 Digital badges show students' skills along with degree
 Passport, a new classroom app created by Purdue University, allows instructors and advisers to give students digital badges to indicate mastery of skills.
 The application uses Mozilla's Open Badge infrastructure and is available for use by instructors at any institution. (Purdue University image)
Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Digital badges, icons that represent academic achievements or skills smaller than a college degree, are an increasingly popular way for universities to acknowledge the breadth of student learning.
 Now Purdue University has developed a pair of mobile apps that make creating, awarding and displaying badges much easier. The apps, available online, are called 
Passport and Passport Profile . A video explaining how Passport works is available on YouTube. Kyle Bowen, director of informatics in Information Technology at Purdue, says badges are an exciting new concept that is being adopted across higher education.
 "Badges become a way to recognize learning in all of its forms," Bowen says. "Passport provides a platform for anyone who wants to deliver learning credentials.
 From creation of the challenge to creating the actual badge image itself, and then a way to display earned badges, it's all built into the platform.
 "Many instructors are moving to new models of instruction, and Passport is a technology that supports many of those new models."
 Gerry McCartney, Purdue's vice president for information technology, CIO and Oesterle Professor of Information Technology, says digital badges can sometimes provide a better view of a student's academic experience.
 "Students learn in many ways and in a variety of settings while attending a university such as Purdue," McCartney says. "In addition to formal lectures and homework, there is also time spent in labs and doing field work; time spent in service projects or internships; and experiences they glean from student organizations.
 The Passport app will give interested faculty and advisers another way to recognize and validate those skills for students." Through their college careers, students gain knowledge and skills that may not be well-represented in their college degrees.
 A student may have learned practical skills such as knowing how to write HTML code, have earned a prestigious scholarship or served as an officer in a student organization.
 Digital badges are becoming a popular way to acknowledge professional skills, and Purdue University has released the Passport application to allow instructors to create badges for their students.
 The creator tool in Passport offers a variety of templates on which instructors or advisers can base their own badges. (Purdue University image)
Download Photo Badges are currently in use or in development at institutions such as MIT, Carnegie Mellon, the University of California-Davis and Seton Hall.
 Organizations outside of higher education are issuing badges, too, including NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, The U.S.
 departments of Veterans Affairs and Education, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the movie studio Disney-Pixar. Purdue's Passport platform integrates with the popular 
Mozilla Open Badge Infrastructure, including Mozilla Backpack. This system, developed by the same organization that develops the Firefox Web browser, allows the digital badge to include metadata such as who issued the badge, how it was earned and when it was earned; users display their badges through the Backpack site.
 Mark Surman, executive director of Mozilla, says badges empower learners to take charge of their online identities and reputations.
 "We believe digital badges are the next step in unlocking the full educational potential of the Web," Surman says. "As a nonprofit organization committed to the power of open collaboration and learning, we're extremely excited to see Purdue take this step.
 It's a milestone for the entire OpenBadges project." Bill Watson, an assistant professor in Purdue's Department of Curriculum and Instruction, was 
instrumental in creating the Passport platform and will be using Passport in a graduate-level course this semester. He says the advantage of badges is that they allow faculty to focus on competencies, skills and learner performance.
 "Typically in courses, we have a number of very broad learning goals, and grades are given out on student assignments tied to these broad goals," Watson says.
 "But really, it is more a comparison of students rather than a focus on student learning and attainment of desired learning outcomes.
 "Badges help instructors encourage students to demonstrate how they have met very specific learning objectives through actual performance.
" Purdue's Passport platform consists of two apps: The Passport app allows instructors to set the steps, or challenges, a student must achieve to earn the badge.
 The app also allows an instructor or adviser to create a badge by choosing from several templates. The second part of the platform is Passport Profile.
 This is an app designed for tablets that allows users to display their badges, both Passport badges as well as badges from their
 Mozilla Backpack. "We've created it so that you can easily show the badges and the information behind them while holding the tablet and showing it to someone," Bowen says.
 "That way you don't have to keep taking the tablet away to navigate through the app. You can show the work behind the badge as you speak.
" Bowen says the Passport Profile app is operated a bit like a guitar. A user holds his or her tablet with the screen facing the interviewer and operates tabs along the bottom of the screen as if they were frets on a guitar neck.
 Then the user "strums," or flicks, through screens and images to display his or her portfolio. "It's designed to work with large gestures so that you don't have to have a good view of it yourself to show off your portfolio," Bowen says.
 "You don't have to click on small buttons with your fingertip. You just make these large gestures that let you move through your presentation.
" A new iPad app created by Purdue University allows users to display professional digital badges. The app is part of Purdue's Passport platform, and can display badges from the Passport app or from the popular Mozilla Backpack.
 (Purdue University image)Download Photo In addition to displaying Passport badges, the latest version of Passport Profile, which has been submitted to the Apple iTunes App Store, can also display any Mozilla Open Badge.
 Each badge also has a URL that users can share on social media sites. "As we get more users we'll build in a share function," Bowen says.
 A sample badge is available at http://www.openpassport.org. At the site users can create a Passport account or login using their Facebook or Google+ credentials.
 Among the first uses of badges at Purdue will be for students who have successfully completed courses through nanoHUB-U, a collection of short courses in nanotechnology offered online to an international audience.
 The courses focus on technical subjects in science and engineering; upcoming courses for this fall include "Fundamentals of Atomic Force Microscopy" and "Nanoscale Transistors.
" Students who successfully complete the courses based on scores from five weekly exams and the scientific simulation and virtual experimentation homework assignments will receive a badge.
 Students who successfully completed previous Purdue nanoHUB-U courses in "Fundamentals of Nanoelectronics" have already been given the opportunity to receive Passport badges.
 In the Spring of 2013 nanoHUB-U will offer badges for the classes "From Atoms to Materials: Predictive Theory and Simulations" and "Thermal Energy at the Nanoscale.
" Purdue is looking for instructors or institutions that would like to try the beta version of Passport as part of its test pilot program.
 "We're looking for up to 200 instructors and up to 10,000 students outside of Purdue to test the app," Bowen says. "There's no charge for instructors to use the app, but we would like feedback on how it was used in the classroom and suggestions on how to improve the application.
" Passport and Passport Profile are two of six classroom apps created by the Purdue Studio project. The apps can be used by instructors or students to enhance the traditional classroom experience.

 Disaster recovery expert: Neighbors are key to beating the heat
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - While many people struggling with the national heat wave and mass power outages may be forced offline from their social media friends, coping is possible with help from the faces next door, says a Purdue University disaster recovery expert.
 "A virtual network isn't of any use, but a neighborhood net is powerful during a crisis like this," says Daniel Aldrich, associate professor of political science.
 "Someone may have a thousand friends on Facebook but if those friends don't live close by then they can't help. Research shows that people who fare better during heat waves or ice storms do so because they have face-to-face relationships with neighbors.
 It also can be life-saving for elderly and other compromised individuals." About two million households are without power in various parts of the United States, and many may be without power through the week.
 "It is difficult to go to someone's house to cool off or borrow space in their fridge if you haven't met that neighbor before," says Aldrich, who has been personally affected by the power outage in Maryland.
 "This kind of disaster drives us outside and gives us something to talk about and as a result, our face-to-face social connections deepen.
 People trust their neighbors during these situations and that trust will last for a few weeks or months after the event." Aldrich says relying on neighbors during crisis isn't just about access to material resources, but also information.
 For example, when most people don't have access to television, the Internet or other forms of mass communication, word of mouth is the best way for people to learn about cooling-off centers, businesses distributing free ice or children's activities.

 Disaster recovery expert on rebuilding 7 years after Katrina 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Friendships and knowing one's neighbors are key to the Hurricane Katrina communities successfully rebuilding since the 2005 disaster, says a Purdue University disaster recovery expert.
 "Buildings may fall and streets may flood, but these social connections survive during these disasters," says Daniel P. Aldrich, an associate professor of political science and author of the new book "Building Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery.
" "The lesson learned from Hurricane Katrina is to stockpile friends, because people who survive and then return to rebuild their community after a disaster are more likely to do so because of their individual friendships, community connections and civic involvement.
" Aldrich's book, which will be released later this month by the University of Chicago Press, looks at the role that friendships, community relationships and civic participation play when recovering from a disaster.
 His study of Hurricane Katrina specifically focuses on the areas of the Lower Ninth Ward and the Village de L'Est. Both areas have similar poverty levels, but the population of the Village de L'Est rebounded and the community rebuilt quickly because of the residents' social networks, Aldrich says.
 "The Village de L'Est is a Vietnamese community strongly connected by its faith and strong relationships, and after people were evacuated to other states, church leaders drove to evacuation sites to meet with community members and share messages and photos between friends that had been dispersed," Aldrich says.
 "When they returned to their neighborhood it was easy for them to work as a group to petition for the electricity to be restored and begin rebuilding.
 "Without these relationships, people are not as successful at coordinating efforts and activities to rebuild. The community loses its foundation.
" These social networks are so powerful that they also can have negative effects by influencing the recovery of other areas. For example, some areas in New Orleans with higher civic participation and individual connections were able to mobilize to block temporary housing from being placed in their community.
 "In this case, one group's social capital pushed unwanted facilities into the backyards of weaker communities," Aldrich says. Aldrich also has studied disaster recovery and community rebuilding following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in Tamil Nadu, the 1923 earthquake in Tokyo and the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan.
 Aldrich, who was a professor at Tulane University when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, credits a neighbor with encouraging his family to evacuate as the storm approached.
 He continues to work with colleagues at Louisiana State University to study disaster recovery after the hurricane, as well as after the April 2010 oil spill.
 Aldrich and his colleagues are observing high rates of depression, domestic violence and divorce as they interview area residents since the Gulf spill.

Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering, providing $10 million in additional research funding for the Discovery Park center through 2018, officials announced Tuesday (Sept.
 11). "This funding of $2 million a year for the next five years will allow the Regenstrief Center to focus on front-line impact with its research," said Purdue acting President Timothy Sands.
 "Researchers will now have additional support to pursue projects with the greatest opportunities to enhance efficiencies in our nation's $2 trillion health-care system.
" Jack Shaw, president of the Indianapolis-based Regenstrief Foundation, said the partnership, initiated in 2005, has been an investment not just in Purdue, but also in addressing the critical health-care issues facing every American.
 "We're excited about what this additional funding will mean to the Purdue center's research efforts for addressing a U.S. health-care industry that remains in serious need of reform," Shaw said.
 The Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering (RCHE) was borne out of the 2004 report, "Building a Better Delivery System: A New Engineering/Health Care Partnership," by the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.
 Co-written by Purdue industrial engineering professor and RCHE Advisory Committee member W. Dale Compton, the report outlined ways that systems engineering could help deliver safe, effective, timely, equitable, efficient and patient-centered health care.
 Regenstrief Center director Steve Witz, Purdue's St. Vincent Health Chair of Healthcare Engineering, said RCHE has leveraged nearly $16 million worth of funding from the Regenstrief Foundation into more than $53 million in health-care related research funding from federal and state agencies, industry players, and organizations.
 To date, Regenstrief's research has launched the Infusion Pump Informatics Network to assist several Midwest hospitals in sharing best practices on the use of what are known as "smart pumps.
" Witz said the new funding will help the center expand its focus on the center's two research focus areas: care coordination and population health.
 RCHE's research and dissemination partners include 13 provider and professional organizations. Mayo Clinic became a partner in 2010, joining others such as the American College of Physicians, Ascension Health and Community Health Network.
 Regenstrief also was a founding member of the Healthcare Systems Engineering Association, a national professional organization promoting excellence in research and education in health-care systems engineering.
 "We envision a health-care system that guides patients and families through their health-care experience, while respecting patient choice, offering physical and psychological supports, and encouraging strong relationships between patients and the health-care professionals accountable for their care," Witz said.
 "We envision communities that foster health and wellness as well as national, state and local systems of care fully invested in the prevention of disease, injury and disability - reliable, effective and proactive in helping all people reduce the risk and burden of disease.
" RCHE also is impacting the next generation of health-care engineers and researchers by offering internships, fellowships and exposing undergraduate and graduate students to research opportunities in a variety of disciplines.
 In addition, the center is collaborating with the Regenstrief Institute Inc., which is located at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis.
 An international leader in health-care informatics, the institute was launched in 1969 and today has one of the world's first and largest electronic medical record systems with more than 300 million online clinical results.
 The Regenstrief Foundation helped create Purdue's Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering with a $3 million gift in 2005 and invested another $11 million in 2008 to support additional research efforts through 2013.
 The center's formal charge is to use systems engineering, management, science and information technology to improve patient care and safety.
 The Regenstrief Foundation is named for benefactor Sam Regenstrief, who emigrated from Vienna to Indianapolis as a child. Regenstrief founded a company that manufactured and popularized the low-cost home dishwasher, at one time producing 37 percent of the world's dishwashers in Connersville, Ind.
 Regenstrief died in 1988. The foundation's work supports the legacy of Sam Regenstrief's vision: The continued improvement of the health-care delivery system.
 The Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering makes its home in the $12.4 million Gerald D. and Edna E. Mann Hall, which opened in 
Discovery Park in May 2007..

 Double-crop soybeans struggle to mature; could be valuable forage
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Many of Indiana's double-crop soybeans will struggle to reach maturity before the first killing freeze, meaning the plants could provide another forage option for livestock producers struggling to feed their herds.
 An early wheat harvest and dry spring weather allowed growers to plant double-crop soybeans farther north in the state than what is typical, but record-setting heat and drought kept the crop from germinating in a timely manner, or at all.
 Fields that germinated late aren't likely to reach maturity and could potentially supplement the state's decimated livestock feed resources.
 "Soybeans that won't reach physiological maturity before a killing freeze do have value as forage at the proper stage of maturity," said Keith Johnson, Purdue Extension forage specialist.
 "The crop should be harvested as a forage before green leaves begin to yellow." Johnson recommended harvesting the crop and ensiling it, rather than harvesting it as hay.
 Doing so reduces the loss of leaves, which are the highest feed-quality part of the plant. It also lessens the likelihood of rain damage because the crop can be harvested as silage more quickly after cutting it as compared to making the soybean plant as hay.
 "If chopped and ensiled, livestock will be less likely to sort out the lower quality stem, as compared to when soybeans are made and fed as long-stemmed hay," Johnson said.
 Grazing soybean fields also can be an option, but it is more management-intensive and comes with risks. "In my opinion, grazing soybean forage is risky because it is difficult to control selective grazing of immature grain," Johnson said.
 "Founder and off-feed problems could result if over-consumption of the seed occurs." Growers and livestock producers also need to be aware of any pesticides that were applied to their crops, including miticides used more heavily this year to combat spider mite infestation.
 Pesticides have different harvest restrictions and some are not registered for use when soybeans are harvested as a forage crop.
 Double-crop soybean growers who don't produce livestock still might have opportunities to sell the ailing crop to local livestock producers.
 Pricing is driven by current alfalfa prices and the soybean crop's forage quality, and will depend on who provides the labor and equipment to harvest the crop.
 "If the livestock producer is harvesting the crop, the soybean grower would need to subtract out the harvest custom rates from the value of the forage," Johnson said.
 Growers in much of the southern part of Indiana are eligible to carry crop insurance on their double-crop soybeans. Those who do will need to check with their insurance agents to get clearance before cutting the crop for forage.
 "We don't know when that killing freeze will occur until maybe three days beforehand, so it's important for growers to alert their crop insurance agents early if they are considering this option," he said.

 Downtown location to house Purdue art gallery
 Irwin Weiser, dean of Purdue's College of Liberal Arts, and President France A. Córdova discuss the benefits of a Purdue art gallery in downtown Lafayette.
 Córdova announced the Perrin Building will be home to the new community-based Purdue Galleries space. The painting in the background is a Diego Rivera from the Purdue fine art collection.
 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University will locate a new gallery in the heart of downtown Lafayette that will make a variety of art more accessible to the community.
 The Perrin Building, 330 Main St., will serve as home to the new community-based Purdue Galleries space. The space is being leased by Purdue from building owner Mike Raisor.
 "This new location offers so many opportunities for Purdue to give back to the community and partner even more actively with the local arts community," said university President France A.
 Córdova. "We want to be part of our vibrant local art community and support the community's efforts to invigorate the downtown.
" Craig Martin is director of Purdue Galleries, which will oversee the new space, scheduled to open in the spring semester. He said that while visitors will see similarities to the Purdue galleries on campus, there would be a notable difference.
 "Visitors will see the same kind of work from regional, national and international artists, along with touring exhibits and items from our permanent collection," Martin said.
 "However, we are looking for ways to be more interactive. We want people who visit to do more than look and leave; we want them to have an engaging experience that makes them want to return.
" Irwin Weiser, the Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, said the Main Street location would bring additional art opportunities to the downtown and enhance the university's presence in community life.
 "We would like to do more with this gallery, given its location right on the square in the heart of the community," Weiser said.
 "To make that happen, we want to engage with Greater Lafayette residents so they can help us create something special." Weiser said the Perrin Building offers a new venue for Purdue Galleries.
 On-campus galleries include the Robert L. Ringel Gallery, which will move from its current space in Purdue Memorial Union to Stewart Center, and the Patti and Rusty Rueff Galleries, located in Pao Hall.
 Purdue Galleries is housed in the Patti and Rusty Rueff School of Visual and Performing Arts. Purdue Galleries' exhibits are made possible by the College of Liberal Arts and with assistance from Friends of the Galleries.

 Drought challenges communities to plan for weather extremes

Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Communities should be mindful of the need to protect citizens from the consequences of extreme weather that include not only too little water but also too much of it, a Purdue Extension water resources specialist says.
 "The drought is a wake-up call to remember to not take our water resources for granted but to think about conservation, to think about how our community is planning for using them wisely in the future," Jane Frankenberger said.
 * Planning industrial developments and public water systems in areas where there are adequate water sources to see the communities through times of drought.
 * Investing in storm-water infrastructure that manages rainfall onsite, such as with permeable pavement; captures and stores rain from roofs and paved surfaces; and creates storm-water wetlands.
 "This drought gives us a glimpse of the future," Frankenberger said. "Scientists expect that the changing climate will cause more extreme conditions on both ends - both more floods and more droughts.
" Drought affects communities in different ways, depending on whether they rely on water from rivers and streams or groundwater, Frankenberger said.
 Indianapolis and other communities that draw water from surface-fed rivers and reservoirs are feeling the drought especially hard because their public water systems are lower than normal.
 Indianapolis in mid-July took an extraordinary step toward water conservation by imposing a ban on watering lawns, among other restrictions.
 Communities such as those in the Greater Lafayette area that draw water from rain-fed aquifers deep underground are more "buffered" from a single drought because they have a more constant supply of water, benefiting from rainfall of many years, Frankenberger said.
 "It takes years for rain to get into groundwater; therefore, it takes years before the shortage of rain would actually affect the groundwater," she said.
 "So those communities probably don't feel the effects quite as dramatically." It will take more than just a couple of heavy rainfalls to replenish rivers and streams that are losing water, Frankenberger said.
 Even with some rain, their levels are likely to continue to fall because plants and trees will take up much of the rainwater before the rest of it can soak into the ground deep enough to flow into waterways.
 Wells of some property owners are going dry, especially those that are shallow and in formations most in contact with precipitation.
 They are likely to feel the effects of drought first, Frankenberger said. Others are losing water as larger, neighboring wells, such as a public water system or irrigation well, draw large amounts of water from the area.
 Indiana has a law ensuring the rights of property owners to the water under their land. Property owners whose wells go dry because of water drawn from a neighboring large-capacity well can file a complaint with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, which will investigate.
 The state could work with the owner of the larger well to financially compensate the owner of the smaller well who might need to drill deeper for water.
 Despite the drought, Frankenberger said Indiana remains largely a water-rich state, primarily because of its supply of groundwater.
 But she said consumers should be aware of the importance of water and shortages by taking conservation steps, including: * Invest in low-flow plumbing - faucets, toilets and showerheads that use less water than regular fixtures.
 * Capture and store rainfall in rain barrels and cisterns to provide water that can be used during dry spells. Information on water levels throughout the state is available at 
http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/?m=real&r=in&w=map In addition, the state has a water shortage plan that is the basis for current water shortage warnings.
 The plan is available at http://www.in.gov/dnr/water/files/watshplan.pdf Video of Jane Frankenberger explaining how the drought has affected water tables in Indiana is available at

 Drought could cost farmers with future delivery contracts
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Drought conditions could hit Indiana farmers in the pocketbook in more ways than one, Purdue Extension agricultural economist Chris Hurt says.
 Not only could water-starved corn and soybean crops produce smaller yields and cut into farmers' revenues, but they also could force some growers who signed future delivery contracts with grain buyers to buy back some bushels they are unable to supply, Hurt said.
 "We've been hearing of producers calling their grain managers and talking with them about the possibilities of dealing with these yield reductions," Hurt said.
 "Right now it's hard to say what will happen because nobody knows where grain prices are going to go." With some parts of Indiana now nearing a month without significant rainfall and the critical pollination phase of corn either already started or about to begin, large crop losses appear likely for some farmers.
 Those losses would be especially painful for farmers who sold a large percentage of their anticipated corn crop this spring in forward cash contracts.
 In forward contracts, producers promise to deliver a specified amount of grain to buyers well before their crops are harvested. In turn, farmers are guaranteed a set price for their grain, even if grain prices fall below that set price before their deliveries are made.
 Farmers face a double whammy if the drought persists, Hurt said. On one hand, they could fail to produce enough crop to meet their contractual obligations.
 On the other, they could lose additional revenue if prices rise above their locked-in rate. Hurt gave the example of a farmer who agreed to sell corn at $5 a bushel based on an anticipated production of 150 bushels per acre, for $750 in revenue per acre.
 If drought reduced the farmer's production to 120 bushels per acre and pushed cash prices to $6 a bushel, the farmer would deliver that smaller crop at the price agreed upon but then have to pay the buyer for the 30 bushels per acre the farmer was unable to supply.
 That undeliverable charge would be $30 per acre, based on the $1 per bushel more than the contract price the grain is now worth.
 "That 120 bushels delivered would only generate $600 for the farmer," Hurt said. "Then, after the farmer paid the $30 on the non-delivered grain, they would have only $570 of revenue per acre, or $180 per acre less revenue than they had originally planned.
" "First, if they have a local buyer - a grain elevator, processor or local livestock operation - they can buy back some of those bushels that have been forward-sold," he said.
 "Probably for most producers at this point they're going to have to pay some difference for those bushels lost, but they would avoid further potential losses if prices move even higher.
 "A second common strategy would be to buy futures to offset some of the price impacts. Buying futures still means they would be committed to deliver the cash position, so that doesn't get them out of the need to physically deliver.
 But it does get them some recovery against even higher prices. If prices go higher they could gain on their futures position and those gains could help offset losses on their cash-forward contract.
" Hurt said a third strategy is to buy call options - contracts that give farmers the right, but not the obligation, to buy a fixed number of bushels for a specific price by a specific date.
 "The farmer would have to pay a premium for those rights but would have price protection against rising prices," Hurt said. "Options strategies do not deal with the need to deliver physical bushels; they simply are used as a way to potentially generate positive returns if prices rise.
 These positive returns can then be used to offset some of the negative consequences of the bushels that cannot be delivered at higher prices.
" Hurt urged farmers who are concerned that they have sold more bushels than they might produce to contact their grain buyers and discuss delivery alternatives.
 Not all the news is bad. In drought years, farmers can still see their revenues increase through what economists call the "natural hedge.
" "It's this concept that when a major production state has reduced yields due to something like drought conditions, prices generally go higher than yields go down," Hurt said.
 "So if yield losses for an entire region or a state were 10 percent but prices go up by, say, 15 or 20 percent, actual revenues in a drought year can be higher than in a year when you have normal yields.
" For example, Indiana's average corn yield in 2011 was down 7 percent from the previous year, but prices were 16 percent higher, meaning farmer revenues per acre were higher than in 2010.
 Hurt said if yield losses are widespread enough this year, higher prices would help compensate farmers for some of their lost crop.
 There is another glimmer of hope for farmers with grain left over from the 2011 crop season. The longer the drought continues the better the odds that their stored grain will increase in value, Hurt said.
 With July corn futures moving prices to about $6.60 to $6.70 a bushel, old-crop cash corn should push past $7 per bushel, Hurt said.
 "If we go above $6.75 or $6.80 on July futures, then I think we've got a real shot at retesting the all-time highs at around $8.
" Hurt said he talked to one farmer who has 88,000 bushels of old-crop corn in storage. "That's over half a million dollars worth of corn," he said.
 Old-crop soybeans could hit $15 a bushel and jump to about $16.50 per bushel should weather patterns remain unchanged, Hurt said.
 "We have a very bullish situation ahead if the drought continues," Hurt said. "We could have quite an explosive market. But that could all change if we get rain.

 Drought could have lasting effect on trees, specialist says

 Although turning of leaf color is inevitable in autumn, yellowing of leaves at this time of year is a symptom of drought stress.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Keith Robinson)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Although trees have deeper moisture-reaching roots than agricultural crops, they are not immune to this summer's persistent drought, a Purdue Extension urban forestry specialist says.
 Trees across Indiana and the Midwest are struggling in the arid conditions. Some could succumb or suffer for years to come, Lindsey Purcell said.
 "Drought can have a major impact on tree health and survival by effectively slowing and reducing growth," he said. "If drought is severe enough or lasts for a prolonged period of time - such as what we're experiencing now - it also can cause death to all or portions of a tree.
" More common, however, is the effect drought has on a tree's ability to withstand insects and diseases. A water-deprived tree is unable to produce its usual levels of carbohydrates, significantly lowering its energy reserves.
 Those reserves are needed for a tree to produce chemicals that ward off pathogens. The drought also is providing an ideal environment for emerald ash borers, Purcell said.
 EAB is an invasive insect that kills ash trees. All 92 Indiana counties are experiencing some level of drought, with many counties in the northeast, south-central and southwest parts of the state in extreme drought, according to the U.S.
 Drought Monitor. Purcell said the drought already has left trees in urban areas with permanent damage, although it might not be evident this year.
 Warm weather earlier this year interrupted normal bud formation, which controls shoot length and expansion. The dry conditions that followed led to decreased numbers of new leaves within buds and new stem segments.
 "Drought not only influences the number of leaves but also the size, as well as twig extension the following year when those buds expand," Purcell said.
 "The result of prolonged dry conditions may not inhibit the first growth but may decrease the number of stem units formed in the new bud that will expand during the second or third, or more, flushes of growth.
 If drought continues, all growth flushes will be affected. Thus, tree growth next year will be atypical and, again, create predisposed conditions to diseases and insects if not monitored and managed properly.
" While not something most homeowners think about doing, watering trees of any size and age can go a long way toward minimizing drought damage, especially for newly planted trees or those less established, Purcell said.
 When watering younger and newly established trees, homeowners should follow the "5 plus 5" rule each week: give the tree 5 gallons of water plus 5 gallons for every diameter inch of tree trunk.
 For example, if a tree has a trunk diameter of 4 inches, provide 20 gallons of water slowly over the root zone. For older, well-established trees Purcell recommends providing an additional inch of water every week or so to keep leaves turgid.
 To measure an inch of water, place an empty tuna or cat food can under a tree's canopy and turn on a sprinkler system. Turn off the sprinkler when the water is 1 inch deep in the can.
 "For those trees with mulch beds, you should consider adding a half gallon of water per square foot of mulch area," Purcell said.
 In addition to watering, Purcell urged homeowners to protect tree trunks from mechanical damage such as lawn mowers and string trimmers, reduce competition for available moisture with other plants, turf and shrubs, and add mulch to the root zone of trees at a depth of at least 2 inches to preserve soil moisture.

 Drought could limit garden plants' development next year
 Even in a well-maintained garden, plants can show signs of heat stress. Purdue Extension consumer horticulturist Rosie Lerner displays an Armenian basket flower that is struggling in the Purdue Horticulture Garden.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - As if home gardeners don't have their hands full just trying to keep their plants healthy in this drought and scorching heat, they also need to know this: environmental stress this year could influence how the plants develop next year, Purdue Extension consumer horticulturist Rosie Lerner says.
 The columnist who writes the monthly "Purdue Yard & Garden News" also says some gardeners ultimately might have to decide which plants to try to save and which to let go.
 "Gardeners have a battle on their hands to keep plants healthy when extremely high temperatures are accompanied by lack of rain," Lerner writes in her June column titled "In Times of Drought.
" "Keep in mind that next year's growth will be determined by buds that form this summer and early fall. Flower buds for spring flowering and fruiting plants will also be developing during this time.
 So the damaged inflicted by drought now may affect next season." Compounding the problem are any watering restrictions or a gardener's limited ability to water larger numbers of plants.
 "You may have to limit watering and prioritize which plants will be rescued - a bit of garden triage, so to speak," Lerner says.
 She offers advice in her column to home gardeners trying to keep their flowers, shrubs, trees and vegetables as healthy as possible this summer.
 Among her tips: * New plants need 1 to 1 1/2 inches of water per week to maintain optimum flowers foliage, roots and fruits. "In times of drought, established plants may tolerate 10-14 days between watering," she writes, "but be aware that problems such as fruit cracking and blossom end-rot will increase.
" * The best way to water a garden is by soaking the soil thoroughly - but slowly - in one application. "This slow, deep watering will encourage deeper root growth, which in turn will be better able to withstand drought," she says.
 "Frequent shallow water encourages shallow roots, which are more likely to succumb to heat and drying of the topsoil." * Household "gray water" - such as that leftover from a bath or washing dishes - can be used but with caution.
 "Gray water could have a high level of detergent salts, which can eventually build up to harmful levels in the soil," Lerner writes.
 Water from a water softener has a high level of sodium that can tighten soil, preventing water from passing through it. "Use gray water only as a last resort, and use it as sparingly as possible to avoid salt buildup," she says.
 Lerner says gray water should never be used to irrigate edible crops or on plants in containers because of health risks associated with it.
 Lerner also writes the monthly column "In the Grow," offering gardening tips in a question-and-answer format. That and other Purdue Extension news columns are available at

 Drought has potential three-year 'tail' on beef production

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Livestock producers who fail to properly manage the drought could find themselves dealing with the consequences long after the rains return, says a Purdue Extension beef specialist.
 Exceptionally high temperatures and extremely low rainfall have combined to stress livestock and reduce their feed supplies. Producers can take steps to manage a situation that might cost some money now but could pay off in big ways in the long run.
 "The tail on this can be pretty long if we don't manage things right in a drought year," Ron Lemenager said. "One thing that I think is really important for producers to consider this year is body condition.
 If you use condition scores of these cows as a barometer of where you're at nutritionally, we can't do much about the heat or drought, but we can make sure we don't have any nutritional deficiencies.
" In a drought year, forages are low in both quality and quantity, which can leave cows thin and undernourished. Less-than-optimal body conditions can have reproductive consequences not only this year, but next year as well.
 Heat stress coupled with poor nutrition can create a double whammy by lowering oocyte and sperm quality, as well as embryo survival if fertilization does occur, Lemenager said.
 "The environmental conditions we are experiencing have ratcheted stress forward into the heart of the breeding season for those that calve in the spring, meaning it's very probable we'll see more open cows than normal this fall," he said.
 Lemenager said the likely increase in open cows this year means producers need to pregnancy-check cows to minimize the use of expensive feeds.
 When forages are in short supply, there is little reason for producers to feed non-productive animals. Instead, they can consider marketing culled cows earlier than normal to take advantage of higher market prices.
 "If we're short on forage we have the option of sliding by, but if cows are thin going into the fall, fewer will be bred, calves will be lighter at weaning time this year and fewer calves will be born next year," Lemenager said.
 "Then, if cows are thin heading into next breeding season, fewer cows will be bred and colostrum quality will be lower, meaning a lower calf survival rate which affects productivity in years two and three.
" To avoid the three-year "tail," he said producers might need to pay the price now to supplement feed and make sure cows are healthy and in moderate body condition.
 Healthy cows will breed better and can shorten the time producers face fallout from the drought. In addition to monitoring body condition, Lemenager and Purdue Extension forage specialist Keith Johnson offered producers a list of steps they can take to manage drought and heat stress:
 More detailed information about each of these steps, including sample diet formulations, can be found in Lemenager and Johnson's publication, "Beef Management Practices for Coping With a Short Forage Supply" on the Purdue Animal Sciences Beef Center website at

 Drought has repercussions for Indiana fish and wildlife

Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The drought likely will temporarily alter movement patterns and habitat selection of some Indiana wildlife unable to find food, water and shelter as the resources of their natural environments dwindle, Purdue University wildlife experts say.
 Although the impact of the drought on wildlife is unknown at this time, Purdue Extension wildlife specialist Brian MacGowan does not expect lasting effects.
 "Most of the things that we will see this year are going to have short-term implications," MacGowan said. "Typically, nature rebounds as long as bad years of weather are followed by good years.
 However, if the drought resulted in reduced food availability, that will likely result in lower survival of young and weak animals and lower reproduction next year.
 "Good weather next year, however, can lead to a good reproductive year that can offset losses from this year." Two results of the drought - reduced availability of water and poor plant growth - might force wildlife to seek food and shelter in places where they do not usually live, MacGowan said.
 Animals that require open water for drinking and reproduction likely will suffer the most, he said. Even animals such as groundhogs, which get most of their water from the vegetation they eat, may be forced to look for open water and may be seen in areas where they are not typically observed.
 Conversely, some wildlife could be seen less, MacGowan said. Snakes may change their movements to exclusively nighttime, or salamanders and toads may go underground in response to hot and dry weather.
 Although frogs and salamanders need wetlands for reproduction, the early spring "jump-started" reproduction in many amphibians. 
The drought's most obvious repercussion - reduction or slowing of plant growth - will reduce shelter and food for wildlife. MacGowan said many songbirds nest or forage on the ground or in the shrub layer.
 Reduced plant growth may result in less protected or concealed nests and reduced fruit production by plants. Homeowners who have watered fruit-producing shrubs may see more birds this summer and fall as they change movements and habitat to take advantage of available food.
 Because the drought is spotty in some areas, it is difficult to determine how it will affect deer, MacGowan said. In areas hit hard by the drought, survival rates among fawns could fall because of reduced summer forage.
 That, coupled with less fall mast - fruit or seed of woody trees and shrubs - could reduce the survival rate or reproduction among adult deer, especially if there is a harsh winter.
 Aquatic ecosystems will feel the impact of the drought as rivers and streams dry up, said Reuben Goforth, assistant professor of aquatic ecosystems.
 Fresh-water mussels, for example, could become stranded and die. This is a concern because some mussels, including species in the Tippecanoe River, are endangered species.
 Even if there is enough water, the ability of a river or stream to hold oxygen decreases as the water temperature increases, Goforth said.
 Consequently, fish may move to rivers with deeper water. Although there have not been fish deaths on a large scale, Goforth said there remains a chance that this could happen.

 Drought in Indiana worsens; no letup in sight
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Drought and high heat continue their stranglehold on Indiana, stressing crops and farmers - and there is little hope for relief on the horizon.
 Most of the state is now in either moderate, severe or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/
) released Thursday (June 28). Extreme drought - the second-highest level of drought - spread across southwest Indiana and developed in many counties in the northeast.
 Areas faring relatively better are Indiana's extreme northwest and southeast counties, which are rated abnormally dry - a category designated to monitor possible future drought.
 "It's quite disheartening to note that things are going downhill every passing day," said Dev Niyogi, Indiana state climatologist.
 "There is just not any rain coming at this point." Because crops were planted early this spring, plants are at growth stages when they are transpiring moisture from the soil at a rapid rate, meaning soil moisture is being consumed faster than it can be replaced - even with a return to normal rainfall.
 Much of Indiana's corn crop has entered pollination, a critical period in plant development. With extreme temperatures and no rain, pollination success is likely to vary widely from field to field and even within fields.
 Some fields could suffer complete pollination failure, said Bob Nielsen, Purdue Extension corn specialist. "I don't know how much worse it could be in terms of a corn crop coming into pollination around the state," he said.
 Pollination failure could spell disaster for the crop's yields. Nielsen encouraged growers to get out in their fields to assess damage and estimate yields as soon as pollen shed is complete.
 Even if pollination is successful in some fields, he said growers aren't out of the woods. Triple-digit temperatures could combine with drought stress to cause plants to abort kernels in the next few weeks.
 Nielsen said growers need to monitor fields throughout the remainder of the season and plan ahead for marketing and other financial decisions for harvest.
 Farmers, agronomists and economists remember conditions in 1988, when a seasonlong drought devastated crops. There hasn't been a worse drought year since then.
 "I'm not sure if we can yet say this is on par with '88, but I think we're a close second," Nielsen said. "There's no question this drought is getting worse, not better.
 I'm a heck of a lot more pessimistic than I was a couple of weeks ago." Purdue Extension agricultural economist Chris Hurt estimated that corn yields could already be down by as much as 14 percent from what was projected at the beginning of the season.
 Early-season projections estimated Indiana's corn crop would yield about 166 bushels per acre. That number is now down to 142 bushels per acre.
 Hurt said projected soybean yields are down 12 percent - from 49 bushels projected per acre at the start of the season to 42.5 bushels per acre now.
 The potentially good news for growers is that the commodities markets have taken notice of the reduced yields, with corn futures now trading 15 percent higher than they were early in the season.
 Soybean futures have made a smaller jump, up 7 percent. But while higher prices could be a revenue balance for growers who have a crop, they do little to help those who lose an entire crop.
 They also have the potential to strain the budgets of livestock producers who rely on grain to feed their herds. Purdue Extension has compiled resources for both grain and livestock producers weathering the drought.
 Those can be found on the Corny News Network: Crops and Drought page at http://www.kingcorn.org/cafe/drought. Local weather and drought updates also are available through the Indiana State Climate Office at Purdue via 
http://iclimate.org/. Both pages will be updated frequently as new information and resources become available.

Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana's hay crop is struggling toweather the drought, leaving livestock producers to search for alternativefeedstuffs for their herds and flocks.
 The state's alfalfa crop, while high in quality, is low inquantity after a spring freeze reduced the first cutting and drought reducedsubsequent cuttings.
 Drought also has wreaked havoc on other grass hay sourcesand pastures. "This definitely is a problematic year andscenario," said Keith Johnson, Purdue University Extension foragespecialist.
 "The hay yield certainly is depressed. I wouldn't be surprisedif the yields were off by 50 percent for some producers." In a more normal year, and with proper management, Indianaalfalfa producers could have as many as five cuttings.
 This year's crop likely willonly be harvested three times in many regions of the state. "The quality of the crop is probably the silverlining," Johnson said.
 "Alfalfa is a drought-tolerant plant, so whathappens in a dry weather scenario is that you have more leaf as compared tostem than you would in a more normal year.
 Leaves are what have thequality." In recent weeks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture hasreleased Conservation Reserve Program land for haying and grazing in manyIndiana counties, but drought has ransacked vegetation on those acres, as well.
 "The quality of CRP hay is certainly not forlactating dairy cows but, rather, for dry beef cows or dry ewes that haveweaned offspring and have lesser quality needs," Johnson said.
 "Thequality of that hay is not going to be exceptional." The short hay crop and high demand mean livestockproducers already are paying almost twice what they might in a normal year.Johnson said he has seen high-quality hay sell for as much as $300 per ton atnorthern Indiana hay auctions.
 In years with normal hay yields, the crop sellsfor around $150-$175 per ton. Those prices are a strain on the already-tight budgets oflivestock producers - some of whom already are reducing their herds.
 Johnson emphasized those producers who want to maintainherds need to plan ahead for winter feed supplies. Hay isn't likely to beavailable by the time winter rolls around.
 "I think most producers have an idea of the number ofbales they will need to feed the number of livestock they have," he said."What's happened is that hay that was made early in the season, which wassupposed to be stored for feeding in late fall into the winter, is now beingfed in the middle of summer.
 "Producers really need to keep track of where theyare with that and not be caught in a short supply when they have no time toreact to it.
" One management practice Johnson suggested is to limitanimals' hay access time to 8-12 hours a day instead of 24. Doing so is morelabor-intensive, but reduces hay waste.
 "Yes, it's an extra hassle to do that, but in diretimes producers have to be willing to take some extra steps if they want tokeep as much of the livestock operation intact as possible," he said.
 Other options include looking to other feed resources,such as crop residues left over from corn harvest, or even the drought-stressedcorn crop that might not have grain potential.
 "Once cleared by crop insurance adjusters, cornfarmers and livestock producers could potentially make transactions to turnthat corn into a silage crop," Johnson said.
 "An option certainly isto cull the herd, but if we are wise about this, we can look to otherresources." A series of publications have been compiled on the Droughtand Forage Management website at

 Drought monitor, rain outlook a mixed bag for Indiana
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Drought conditions continued to worsen in parts of Indiana during the last week, but improved slightly in others - a pattern likely to continue into the next week, says a Purdue University climatologist.
 A return to more normal rainfall with better area coverage in the region of the state generally northeast of a line from Gary to Richmond contributed to slight improvements.
 Yet the same storm systems consistently missed west-central Indiana, which is the area now showing the greatest declines. "The big story here is that significant precipitation has missed west-central Indiana over and over again," said Ken Scheeringa, associate state climatologist for the 
Indiana State Climate Office, based at Purdue. "This is the area of the state worsening the fastest." In the Thursday (Aug. 2) Drought Monitor update, the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture again extended a swath of exceptional drought - the most intense drought rating available - further into west-central Indiana.
 The drought monitor can be found at http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu. The Indiana State Climate office provides weekly advice to Drought Monitor authors about local changes to the map.
 A long-term ridge of high pressure has caused storm systems to travel in a circular pattern that enters the northwest corner of the state, then extends southeast to the eastern border with Ohio before exiting to the southeast.
 "This northeastern portion of Indiana is very slowly improving because of a return to more frequent rainfall," Scheeringa said. 
 Scheeringa said normal rainfall amounts likely would continue for parts of the state in the coming week, but storm systems might still miss the driest areas.
 All of Indiana is expected to remain hot. "For the next week to 10 days we should see normal rainfall - just enough to keep our drought conditions steady - except in west-central Indiana," Scheeringa said.
 "But, after that, our chances of rain do not look as good. A compilation of free Purdue Extension drought resources is available at

 Drought season highlights damage caused by nematodes
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The drought throughout Indiana is intensifying nematode damage in farm fields, says a Purdue Extension nematologist.
 The needle nematode, soybean cyst nematode and lance nematode all are causing more problems for grain farmers in a year when crops already are stressed by extreme heat and lack of rain.
 Jamal Faghihi explained that nematodes, microscopic roundworms, can be found in fields every year, but the damage is worse during a drought season.
 "The severity of symptoms shows because of the stress in plants," he said. Farmers should know if they are having nematode problems at this point in the summer.
 "They've always been there if you looked hard enough," Faghihi said. "Now, you can't miss it." The needle nematode exclusively feeds on corn and grasses and is found in sandy soils.
 The needle nematode often poses a problem in the spring when the weather is cool and wet. Although the needle nematode is sensitive to heat, Faghihi speculates that this year the early warm weather created an opportunity for the worm to do its damage early.
 He advised farmers to inspect the plant roots early in the season for abnormalities, which include poor development, club-shaped roots and damage resembling herbicide injury.
 The lance nematode is found in corn and soybean fields. Similar to the needle nematode, the lance nematode causes damage to plants that results in yellow, stunted growth with abnormal roots.
 The lance nematode is not deterred by hot weather. The soybean cyst nematode attacks soybean plants and causes the plant to become yellow and stunted.
 This nematode starts as a microscopic worm and ends its one-month life cycle as a cyst containing 200-300 eggs. Earlier in the season the cysts are brown, but this time of year they are white or yellow, the size of a sugar granule and can be seen by the eye.
 Faghihi said farmers should inspect for the presence of the cysts by digging out the root, placing it in water and checking for cysts.
 The cysts are durable and can survive extreme conditions. Faghihi said most soybean cyst nematode-resistant cultivars contain the same source of resistance, PI 88788.
 Nematodes, however, are overcoming that resistance. He said farmers need to understand which resistor is being used in their crops and consider switching to soybeans with another source of resistance.
 Soybeans with resistance derived from Peking are something that Faghihi said farmers should consider as they determine the best course of action for managing the soybean cyst nematodes.
 Crop rotation is another important step farmers can take to weaken the stability of the nematodes because the worms feed exclusively on specific plants.

 Drought stress starting to set in on specialty and produce crops
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Drought that has stunted development of Indiana's corn and soybean crops doesn't necessarily spell disaster for specialty and produce crops, some of which have survived the long, hot, dry spell with less damage.
 But as the season wears on, Purdue University horticulture specialists say the weather is becoming a greater concern - even for drought-tolerant crops and growers with irrigation systems.
 "Indiana irrigation systems have not been designed for the extreme conditions of this summer, and it has been difficult to get enough water on all the crops when they need it," said Liz Maynard, Purdue Extension horticulture specialist.
 "The high temperatures also add additional stress that can reduce yield or quality even for crops that are irrigated." * Tree fruits: Tree fruits, such as peaches and apples, have been some of the least affected by the heat and drought.
 Purdue horticulture professor Peter Hirst explained that water is important in the first month of plant development because the fruit is the primary recipient of water.
 The drought currently is affecting shoot growth much more than fruit growth. Shoots are not growing at their normal rate, which can be beneficial for trees because less pruning is needed and the fruit has more opportunity to receive sunlight.
 * Berries: Irrigation is typical for berry crops, including strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. But the extreme conditions might have made it difficult for irrigation systems to keep up with the crops, said Bruce Bordelon, Purdue Extension horticulture specialist.
 The hot temperatures cause berries to ripen quickly and may result in soft, less flavorful fruit. Reduced soil moisture also can reduce berry size.
 * Grapes: The weather is now beginning to pose a serious problem for the grape crops. Well-established vineyards have deep, extensive root systems and, until recently, vines were showing only slight drought stress.
 Bordelon said dry weather usually increases fruit quality because there is less fruit rot, and sugar concentration within the fruit is increased.
 But with the extended drought and heat, vineyards are beginning to show signs of stress. Young vines are dropping leaves, while older vines are showing stress on hot, sunny days.
 Rain is needed soon or the crop might not ripen. * Cantaloupe and watermelon: Watermelon has suffered because of reduced fruit set and yield.
 Purdue Extension specialist Dan Egel estimates that about half of watermelon fields are not irrigated. Recent rainfall aided some watermelon fields but came too late for others.
 Cantaloupes have not been as seriously affected by the drought because most fields are irrigated. Some cantaloupes, however, have suffered from the extreme heat.
 * Tomatoes: Despite proper irrigation, tomatoes have been affected by the weather. Like berries, the heat has made it difficult to keep tomato crops well watered, Maynard said.
 When there are lapses in irrigation, the tomato may develop blossom-end rot, a disease that occurs when the fruit receives insufficient calcium and shows as a dark lesion on the bottom of the fruit.
 During seasons of drought, there may be sufficient calcium in the soil, but the lack of water prevents the calcium from reaching the fruit.

 Drought threatens financial well-being of livestock sector
 Livestock producers are likely to suffer the biggest financial fallout from a drought that encompasses much of the nation. High feed prices from failed grain crops could drive some livestock producers to liquidate herds.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Drought that is spreading across the country is increasing feed prices and quickly spelling financial disaster for livestock producers, Purdue Extension agricultural economist Chris Hurt says.
 While crop producers face serious economic losses from reduced or non-existent yields, the lack of corn, soybean and hay crops could make the fallout even worse for milk, beef, pork, mutton, chicken, egg, turkey and duck producers.
 "The first thought is crop producers will bear the brunt of the financial losses, but losses in animal industries will be enormous over the next year - perhaps considerably greater than for the crop sector," Hurt said.
 Unlike many crop farmers, livestock producers don't typically have any form of income protection comparable to crop insurance. December 2012 corn futures already have risen by nearly 55 percent, and soybean meal futures are up 24 percent.
 "These higher feed prices have to be absorbed by the animal industry, causing a collapse in financial margins," Hurt said. "Higher feed costs cannot be passed on to the consumer in the short run, so animal industries have to take these losses or begin to liquidate animals.
" The lack of profitability is likely to cause some livestock producers to begin liquidation immediately, with Hurt predicting even more liquidation in the fall.
 Increased slaughter in summer and fall will lead to a larger supply of animals, especially beef cattle, on the market. That's likely to push some livestock prices modestly lower, further narrowing any remaining profit margins.
 As that supply dwindles in the long run, meat, egg and dairy product prices will increase and consumers will see higher prices at both the grocery store and restaurants.
 "Animal producers ultimately do get compensation for the higher feed costs, but that comes after a prolonged period of losses that some producers can't survive," Hurt said.
 "Unfortunately, the profit prospects for many in the animal industries will not improve markedly until feed and forage prices can move lower with more normal crops in 2013.
 That means their outlook appears bleak for another 12-15 months. That is a situation where more rapid and deeper liquidation can occur.
" One immediate response from livestock producers has been to seek out and cull low-productivity breeding animals, or to sell animals at lower weights.
 According to Hurt, the average live-hog weight has dropped from 278 pounds to 273 pounds because the drought has already caused increases in feed prices.
 He expects further reductions in coming weeks. Hurt said it's important for livestock producers to help make clear to consumers and policymakers the sort of extreme financial stresses they will face in the coming months.
 "This articulation by the animal industries is important to alert consumers to higher retail food prices, but also to policymakers, " Hurt said.
 "Policymakers will likely have an influence on release of Conservation Reserve Program lands for grazing and haying, on any potential disaster payments from the federal government, and in helping the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S.
 Department of Agriculture make decisions about the size for the 2013 Renewable Fuels Standard." More drought information and resources are available on Purdue Extension's "IN Drought" website at

 Drought widens and strengthens grip on Indiana
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Drought both spread and worsened across Indiana in the past week, with the northern and southwestern portions of the state continuing to suffer the most.
 Nearly all parts of the state except the far southeast and eight counties in the northwest corner are now in some level of drought, according to the U.S.
 Drought Monitor (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?IN,MW) released Thursday (June 21). A week ago, more than half of Indiana's 92 counties were not in drought, although most of them were abnormally dry, a watch category for possible drought to follow.
 The outlook for rain through the end of June offers little hope for farmers who need moisture for crops that are losing potential yield because of lingering, intense dryness since May.
 Rain that was moving into Indiana on Thursday offered the best chance for moisture through the end of June, according to the Indiana State Climate Office, based at Purdue University.
 "Spotty rains can relieve the plant stress, but we will need sustained widespread rains to get the drought stress reduced," said Dev Niyogi, state climatologist.
 "It would mean at least an inch or two of good rain over a wide region for a number of days." Cooler air will flow from the interior lands of Canada during the remainder of this week but won't carry much moisture.
 This air mass will lower temperatures into the 70s by early next week, the office said. That at least will help to lessen evaporation of moisture from soils and crops.
 The outlook for July is for continued above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation. A return to more normal amounts of rain is possible in late July or early August.
 All or parts of six counties in far southwest Indiana are in extreme drought, the second-highest level of dryness on a five-point scale that ranges from abnormally dry to exceptional drought.
 Most counties in northern Indiana and a few in the southwest are in severe drought, the third-highest level. Most of the central counties are in moderate drought, the lowest intensity level of drought.
 Parts of 15 counties in southeast Indiana are abnormally dry. Ken Scheeringa: 765-494-8105, kens@purdue.edu

 EAB likely in most Lafayette-area trees, Purdue expert says 
 An adult emerald ash borer feeds off a leaf. (Purdue University Department of Entomology photo/John Obermeyer) Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.
 - The highly destructive emerald ash borer has been discovered in the city after being found in neighboring Lafayette last year, suggesting that most ash trees in the area now are infested, a Purdue University entomologist and expert on the invasive beetle said.
 Cliff Sadof said homeowners need to decide now if they want to protect their trees next spring because it is time to plan against next year's crop of beetles or begin putting money aside to pay for tree removal.
 He predicts that the beetle will kill every untreated ash in the Lafayette-West Lafayette area in 4-5 years. "To keep ash trees alive, they will have to be protected with an aggressive insecticide program for the next six years as the tidal wave of beetles rolls through our community," Sadof said.
 "After that time, you can reduce insecticide use because most of the EAB will either have starved to death or have been killed by an insecticide-treated tree.
" The discovery of the beetle in a nearly dead ash tree bordering Sagamore Parkway was confirmed last week. The insect was first found in Tippecanoe County near Americus in 2010 and was confirmed in Lafayette in June 2011.
 West Lafayette city forester Bev Shaw said the city has been anticipating the arrival of the EAB since 2003 and has been planting resistant trees along city streets since then.
 "We are planting a variety of tree species to protect against pest outbreaks in the future," she said. Presence of the insect is a death sentence for all ash trees except those protected with certain insecticides.
 "The bug will kill trees slowly at first," Sadof said. "But the number it kills doubles every year." Symptoms of infestation include loss of leaves in the upper one-third of the tree's canopy, vertical splits in the bark, D-shaped exit holes on the trunk, S-shaped tunnels under the bark, heavy woodpecker activity, and shoots coming out of the trunk.
 Neighborhoods with ash trees are encouraged to save money by coordinating group contracts for tree care services. Visit Purdue's EAB page at 
http://www.eabindiana.info for more detailed information on how to organize a neighborhood and protect trees. The EAB has been found throughout Indiana except for 13 counties in the southwest corner of the state.
 It is illegal to move firewood or any ash tree parts from quarantined counties into the protected area. An interactive map of Indiana's quarantined counties is available at 
http://www.in.gov/dnr/entomolo/5349.htm. Indiana also is included in a regional federal quarantine for the EAB. New infestations of the insect have been found in Connecticut, Kansas and Massachusetts over the summer, bringing the number of infested states to 18.

 Early weaning, DDGS feed could cut costs for cattle producers
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - If the drought forces producers to feed a larger portion of distillers dried grains with solubles, cattle can maintain gains and improve meat quality if the animals are weaned early, a Purdue University scientist has shown.
 The finding, reported at the American Society of Animal Science Midwest Meetings in Des Moines, Iowa, could allow some producers to save on rising feed costs in the face of this year's drought.
 Distillers dried grains with solubles, or DDGS, are the leftovers from corn ethanol production. DDGS generally cost about 10 percent less than corn feed.
 "You can essentially use a cheaper feed for a portion of the time and maintain high rates of gain, while improving the quality of the meat," said Jon Schoonmaker, an assistant professor of animal sciences.
 "It decreases fat thickness, but doesn't decrease marbling score." Schoonmaker tested cattle weaned at 100 days instead of a more traditional 200 days.
 Those early weaned cattle were fed diets with no DDGS or one with DDGS content of 30 percent or 60 percent for 99 days, after which they were fed a standard diet with no DDGS.
 At 30 percent of the diet, there was no difference in weight or meat quality. At 60 percent, fat thickness decreased, and marbling, the dispersion of fat within the meat, was unaffected.
 But carcass weight was down about 2.5 percent. Average daily gain and intake were similar among all three treatments. Schoonmaker said he was looking at methods to increase DDGS in calf diets because available forage in pastures can limit cow productivity.
 As cows nurse, they and their calves need to eat more grass. He said cattle producers may be reluctant to wean early because of the rising price of feed, but may have little choice as dry conditions deplete grasses.
 DDGS may offer a less expensive option. "They're thinking corn prices will be extremely high this fall, but if they think of distiller's grains inclusion at 60 percent of the diet, they could save some money," Schoonmaker said.
 Cattle fed DDGS also excrete more nitrogen, which can be an environmental concern. But Schoonmaker's findings showed that early weaned cattle may excrete less nitrogen when fed a high DDGS diet.
 "Young calves utilize protein more efficiently, and they may be using more of that nitrogen for growth," Schoonmaker said. ABSTRACT
 Effect of Increasing Distillers Grains Inclusion on Performance and Carcass Characteristics of Early-Weaned Steers Ninety Angus x Simmental cross steers (199.7 ± 12.2 kg) were weaned at 134 d of age (early-weaned:EW) and allotted to 3 high concentrate diets (20% corn silage) containing either 0, 30, or 60% dry distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) diets.
 Diets contained 15.7, 15.8, and 21.7% CP, respectively. Dietary treatments were fed for 99 d, after which steers were placed on a common diet containing no DDGS (12.9% CP) until slaughter at a common weight (599.4 kg).
 Concentration of dietary DDGS did not affect ADG, DMI, or G:F during the growing phase (P > 0.41), did not produce any carryover effects on ADG, DMI, or G:F during the finishing phase (P > 0.26), and resulted in similar overall performance (P > 0.52).
 Dressing percentage (61.4, 61.6, 60.2%; P < 0.05), hot carcass weight (367.4, 370.4, 361.3 kg; P < 0.06), fat thickness (1.42, 1.53, 1.27 cm; P < 0.10), and % KPH (2.0, 2.2, 2.1%; P < 0.10) responded quadratically to early DDGS supplementation, increasing from 0 to 30% DDGS inclusion and decreasing from 30 to 60% DDGS inclusion, respectively.
 Marbling score was not affected (P > 0.46) by DDGS inclusion, but the partitioning of fat from the subcutaneous (SC) to intramuscular (IM) fat depot was altered by DDGS inclusion (P < 0.10).
 The ratio of IM to SC fat decreased from 0 to 30% DDGS inclusion and increased from 30 to 60% DDGS inclusion. In addition, the percentage of cattle grading choice- responded quadratically (40.2, 26.7, 62.3%; P < 0.10), decreasing from 0 to 30% DDGS inclusion and increasing from 30 to 60% DDGS inclusion, respectively.
 These data indicate that inclusion of high concentrations of dietary DDGS early in the feedlot phase does not negatively impact growth and performance of EW cattle, but does partition energy from carcass to non-carcass components.
 However, high concentrations of DDGS also partitions fat away from the SC to IM fat depot. Utilization of carcass fat as an energy source for disposal of excess N may be responsible for changes in carcass weight and fat deposition.

 Emergency Preparedness Safety Day intended to help students take proactive approach to well-being
 Emergency Preparedness Safety Day intended to help students take proactive approach to well-being WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University and Tippecanoe County safety officials will show off their latest resources and interact with university students on the Purdue Centennial Mall on Wednesday (Sept.
 26) to promote campus safety awareness. The university's third Safety & Emergency Preparedness Day also will include testing of all layers of the Purdue Alert system at 10 a.m.
 It's all part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's annual National Emergency Preparedness Month, which takes place each September.
 "Our campus community of nearly 40,000 students and about 55,000 people in all is very much like a city of its own, and it's important that everyone knows the resources that are available to them and how we can all help keep each other safe," said Ron Wright, emergency preparedness director.
 "Campus safety in terms of using police, fire or any number of other resources is not just a reactive process. There are things students can do to ensure safety so that there is no emergency in the first place, and we encourage them to at least come through the area on Centennial Mall and to feel free to stop by the booths and tables and talk to any of our emergency officials.
" Purdue's police department will bring its canine unit out for demonstrations and will have its alcohol awareness car on site. Subaru of Lafayette will bring a drunk simulator - a windows based program in which participants use a steering wheel and pedals to drive a car on a computer screen.
 Inputs can be made to allow for alcohol consumption, and the computer simulates driver reactions. Additionally, Purdue's fire department will display the university's Mobile Command Center and show its latest equipment.
 The Recreational Sports Complex will promote CPR and lifeguard classes among other programs. Purdue's Radiological and Environmental Management team, the Office of the Dean of Students, Purdue Student Government, Purdue wellness center, the American Red Cross and Tippecanoe County Health Department will be represented.
 The Purdue Alert test will include sirens and will be used to ensure that the various layers of the system are working properly and to simulate a live situation for practice, Wright said.
 The alert system includes campus-wide emailing, text messaging, the Purdue home page, sirens, and alert systems in the residence halls and on Boiler TV.
 The alert posted to the Purdue homepage will state: "This is the semi-annual TEST of the Purdue emergency warning notification system.
 This test simulates a level 1 incident. No action is necessary. However, we do recommend that everyone reviews the Your Campus Your Safety annual security report at 
http://www.purdue.edu/police/pdf/YourCampus.pdf. The publication contains emergency information, and important fire & crime statistics.
 A paper copy is available at the Purdue Police Department." To register to receive emergency text message notifications, go to http://www.purdue.edu/securepurdue
, click on "Change My Emergency Contact Number," enter your Purdue account name and password, click on "Emergency Contact Information" and enter your cell phone number.
 Verizon Wireless subscribers are recommended to update the network information in their cell phones quarterly to help ensure they will receive the text messages.
 To do so, call *228 ("star" 228) and select option 2, "Update Roaming Capabilities." No action is necessary for other wireless carriers.
 Wright recommends that the campus community take time to do four things to help prepare for emergencies: * Review the Emergency Procedures Guide (EPG) that provides "how to respond" information for natural and human-caused incidents.
 An electronic version is located on the Emergency Preparedness website. Additionally, the EPG is also on the Purdue smartphone app under the safety section.
 * Review their Building Emergency Plan to ensure they know evacuation routes and shelter-in-place locations. Purdue police Chief John Cox also reminds the campus community of the importance of reporting suspicious activity to the police department at 765-494-8221, 
police@purdue.edu, or the WE TIP Hotline at 800-782-7463. If it is an emergency, call 911 or use any of the more than 300 emergency telephone boxes (blue light phones) on campus.
 Purdue's police department advocates the Department of Homeland Security's "If You See Something, Say Something™" campaign to raise public awareness and to emphasize the importance of reporting suspicious behavior and situations like an unattended backpack in a public place or someone trying to access a restricted area or any other situation you feel is not quite right.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – A new Purdue University-developed process for creating biofuels has shown potential to be cost-effective for production scale, opening the door for moving beyond the laboratory setting.
 A Purdue economic analysis shows that the cost of the thermo-chemical H2Bioil method is competitive when crude oil is about $100 per barrel when using certain energy methods to create hydrogen needed for the process.
 If a federal carbon tax were implemented, the biofuel would become even more economical. H2Bioil is created when biomass, such as switchgrass or corn stover, is heated rapidly to about 500 degrees Celcius in the presence of pressurized hydrogen.
 Resulting gases are passed over catalysts, causing reactions that separate oxygen from carbon molecules, making the carbon molecules high in energy content, similar to gasoline molecules.
 The conversion process was created in the lab of Rakesh Agrawal, Purdue's Winthrop E. Stone Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering.
 He said H2Bioil has significant advantages over traditional standalone methods used to create fuels from biomass. "The process is quite fast and converts entire biomass to liquid fuel," Agrawal said.
 "As a result, the yields are substantially higher. Once the process is fully developed, due to the use of external hydrogen, the yield is expected to be two to three times that of the current competing technologies.
" The economic analysis, published in the June issue of Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery, shows that the energy source used to create hydrogen for the process makes all the difference when determining whether the biofuel is cost-effective.
 Hydrogen processed using natural gas or coal makes the H2Bioil cost-effective when crude oil is just over $100 per barrel. But hydrogen derived from other, more expensive, energy sources - nuclear, wind or solar - drive up the break-even point.
 "We're in the ballpark," said Wally Tyner, Purdue's James and Lois Ackerman Professor of Agricultural Economics. "In the past, I have said that for biofuels to be competitive, crude prices would need to be at about $120 per barrel.
 This process looks like it could be competitive when crude is even a little cheaper than that." Agrawal said he and colleagues Fabio Ribeiro, a Purdue professor of chemical engineering, and Nick Delgass, Purdue's Maxine Spencer Nichols Professor of Chemical Engineering, are working to develop catalysts needed for the H2Bioil conversion processes.
 The method's initial implementation has worked on a laboratory scale and is being refined so it would become effective on a commercial scale.
 "This economic analysis shows us that the process is viable on a commercial scale," Agrawal said. "We can now go back to the lab and focus on refining and improving the process with confidence.
" The model Tyner used assumed that corn stover, switchgrass and miscanthus would be the primary feedstocks. The analysis also found that if a federal carbon tax were introduced, driving up the cost of coal and natural gas, more expensive methods for producing hydrogen would become competitive.
 "If we had a carbon tax in the future, the break-even prices would be competitive even for nuclear," Tyner said. "Wind and solar, not yet, but maybe down the road.
" The U.S. Department of Energy and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research funded the research. Agrawal and his collaborators received a U.S.
 patent for the conversion process. Sources: Wally Tyner, 765-494-0199, wtyner@purdue.edu Rakesh Agrawal, 765-494-2257, agrawalr@purdue.edu
 ABSTRACT Fast-pyrolysis based processes can be built on small-scale and have higher process carbon and energy efficiency as compared to other options.
 H2Bioil is a novel process based on biomass fast-hydropyrolysis and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and can potentially provide high yields of high energy density liquid fuel at relatively low hydrogen consumption.
 This paper contains a comprehensive financial analysis of the H2Bioil process with hydrogen derived from different sources. Three different carbon tax scenarios are analyzed: no carbon tax, $55/metric ton carbon tax and $110/metric ton carbon tax.
 The break-even crude oil price for a delivered biomass cost of $94/metric ton when hydrogen is derived from coal, natural gas or nuclear energy ranges from 103 to 116/bbl for no carbon tax and even lower ($99–$111/bbl) for the carbon tax scenarios.
 This break-even crude oil price compares favorably with the literature estimated prices of fuels from alternate biochemical and thermochemical routes.
 The impact of the chosen carbon tax is found to be limited relative to the impact of the H2 source on the H2Bioil break-even price.
 The economic robustness of the processes for hydrogen derived from coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy is seen by an estimated break-even crude oil price of $114–126/bbl when biomass cost is increased to $121/metric ton.

 Entomologist: Controlling insects, rodents vital to healthy livestock
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Successfully preventing and eliminating flies and mice in livestock and poultry operations is crucial to maintaining animal health and productivity, says a Purdue University entomologist.
 Cattle in both pasture and confinement situations are affected by flies, as are poultry, said Ralph Williams. Bloodsucking flies literally drain animals' lifeblood, and all flies can transmit diseases, cause discomfort and create a nuisance for neighbors.
 Pastured cattle are mainly targeted by the face fly, which feeds on cattle's mucous membranes and can transmit pink eye. Another pest in pastured cattle is the parasitic horn fly, which lives its entire adult life drinking the blood of one animal.
 Control of pasture pests typically consists of self-application devices such as dust bags, oilers, pour-on products, and insecticide ear tags, Williams said.
 Ear tags have two types of ingredients - pyrethroid and organophosphate. Pyrethroid tags are most effective on face flies. Some horn flies have developed a genetic resistance to pyrethroid, and in this case, horn flies may respond better to organophosphate tags or to a pour-on insecticide.
 Williams advised that producers try ear tags first, and if they are not effective, then to turn to alternative treatments. In confinement operations, cattle are frequently bothered by the housefly, which causes irritation and can transmit diseases, and the bloodsucking stable fly, which directly reduces weight gain and milk production.
 "House and stable flies breed in manure, so proper procedures to minimize their breeding will go a long way in reducing these fly pests,” he said.
 “There are some things you can do to the flies themselves - fly bait, aerosol knockdown sprays, residual insecticides - but without proper manure management, they won't do much good.
" This same advice applies to poultry operations, where houseflies also are a major problem. While they do not pose a serious health threat to the birds, they can become a major nuisance to neighbors.
 Poultry owners can track houseflies by using "spot" or "speck" cards, which are simply 3-by-5-inch index cards fastened in several places around a hen house or building.
 Flies will leave fluid spots on the cards, and the number of spots on the card will provide a rough estimate of how many flies pass through the hen house in a given period.
 Generally, an average of 100 spots per day indicates a serious fly problem. Another poultry pest to watch for is the northern fowl mite, a bloodsucking parasite.
 Northern fowl mites have made a strong comeback in recent years, Williams said, and they can seriously affect on egg production.
 Treatment consists of high-pressure sprays directed into the birds' cages, so they are difficult to treat in large operations. One of the most destructive poultry pests is the house mouse.
 Mice can transmit salmonella, and their chewing can cause significant destruction of facilities and equipment. "Controlling mice requires a yearlong program consisting of constant surveillance and traps," Williams said.
 "There can be several mouse 'families' in any facility, so poison should be spaced every 30 feet or so. Prevent feed spills, keep bait exposed, and use traps to monitor populations, because mice will be a problem if ignored.

 Evidence of life on Mars could come from Martian moon
 The image shows the orbits of the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos and the spread of potential particle trajectories from an asteroid impact on Mars.
 (Purdue University image/courtesy of Loic Chappaz) Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A mission to a Martian moon could return with alien life, according to experts at Purdue University, but don't expect the invasion scenario presented by summer blockbusters like "Men in Black 3" or "Prometheus.
" "We are talking little green microbes, not little green men," said Jay Melosh, a distinguished professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences and physics and aerospace engineering at Purdue.
 "A sample from the moon Phobos, which is much easier to reach than the Red Planet itself, would almost surely contain Martian material blasted off from large asteroid impacts.
 If life on Mars exists or existed within the last 10 million years, a mission to Phobos could yield our first evidence of life beyond Earth.
" Melosh led a team chosen by NASA's Planetary Protection Office to evaluate if a sample from Phobos could contain enough recent material from Mars to include viable Martian organisms.
 The study was commissioned to prepare for the failed 2011 Russian Phobos-Grunt mission, but there is continued international interest in a Phobos mission, he said.
 It will likely be a recurring topic as NASA reformulates its Mars Exploration Program. A Phobos mission was discussed at NASA's Concepts and Approaches for Mars Exploration
 workshop and a report issued Tuesday stated that the Martian moons are "important destinations that may provide much of the value of human surface exploration at reduced cost and risk.
" Melosh collaborated with Kathleen Howell, the Hsu Lo Professor of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, and graduate students Loic Chappaz and Mar Vaquero on the project.
 The researchers combined their expertise in impact cratering and orbital mechanics to determine how much material was displaced by particular asteroid impacts and whether individual particles would land on Phobos, the closer of the two Martian moons.
 The team concluded that a 200-gram sample scooped from the surface of Phobos could contain, on average, about one-tenth of a milligram of Mars surface material launched in the past 10 million years and 50 billion individual particles from Mars.
 The same sample could contain as much as 50 milligrams of Mars surface material from the past 3.5 billion years. NASA's Planetary Protection Office chose a team of Purdue University researchers to evaluate if a sample from the moon Phobos could contain enough material from Mars to include viable Martian organisms.
 The Purdue team stands with an image of possible particle trajectories from an asteroid impact. Standing from left are professors Kathleen Howell, Jay Melosh, and graduate students Loic Chappaz and Mar Vaquero.
 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons)Download Photo "The time frames are important because it is thought that after 10 million years of exposure to the high levels of radiation on Phobos, any biologically active material would be destroyed," Howell said.
 "Of course older Martian material would still be rich with information, but there would be much less concern about bringing a viable organism back to Earth and necessary quarantine measures.
" When an asteroid hits the surface of a planet it ejects a cone-shaped spray of surface material, similar to the splash created when someone does a cannonball into a swimming pool.
 These massive impacts pulverize the surface material and scatter high-speed fragments. The team calculated that the bulk of the fragments from such a blast on Mars would be particles about one-thousandth of a millimeter in diameter, or 100 times smaller than a grain of sand, but similar in size to terrestrial bacteria.
 The team followed the possible paths the tiny particles could take as they were hurtled from the planet's surface through space, examining possible speeds, angles of departure and orbital forces.
 The team plotted more than 10 million trajectories and evaluated which would intercept Phobos and where they might land on the moon during its eight-hour orbit around Mars.
 The probability of a particle landing on Phobos depends primarily on the power of the blast that launched it from the surface, Chappaz said.
 "It is estimated that during the past 10 million years there have been at least four large impact events powerful enough to launch material into space, and we focused on several large craters as possible points of origin," he said.
 "It turns out that no matter where Phobos is in its orbit, it would have captured material from these powerful impact events." After the team submitted its report, scientists identified a large, nearly 60-kilometers-in-diameter crater on Mars.
 The crater, named Mojave, is estimated to be less than 5 million years old, and its existence suggests that there would be an even greater amount of Martian material on Phobos that could contain viable organisms than estimated, Melosh said.
 "It is not outside the realm of possibility that a sample could contain a dormant organism that might wake up when exposed to more favorable conditions on Earth," he said.
 "I participated in a study that found that living microbes can survive launch from impacts on rock, and other studies have shown some microscopic organisms can tolerate a lot of cosmic radiation.
" This possibility has been a consideration for some time, and Michael Crichton's "The Andromeda Strain" brought it to public consciousness in 1969.
 However the movie scenario of a fatal contamination is unlikely, Melosh said. "Approximately one ton of Martian material lands on Earth every year, " he said.
 "There is a lot more swapping back and forth of material within our solar system than people realize. In fact, we may owe our existence to life on Mars.
" "It's difficult to believe there hasn't been life somewhere out there in the vast expanse of space," Howell said. "The question is if the timeline overlaps with ours enough for us to recognize it.
 Even if we found no evidence of life in a sample from Phobos, it would not be a definitive answer to the question of whether or not there was life on Mars.
 There still may have been life that existed too long ago for us to detect it." Melosh recently presented the team's findings at a joint NASA and European Space Agency meeting in Austria, and Chappaz will present the data at a meeting on July 14 in Mysore, India.

 Excited about a cloudy future at Purdue: University and EMC bringing massive data storage to students and faculty
 Excited about a cloudy future at Purdue: University and EMC bringing massive data storage to students and faculty WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.
 — Comedian George Carlin famously observed that all you need in life is a place to put your stuff. For college students, where to put their digital stuff, including materials developed through their academic careers, their many favorite photos, and a multitude of other digital files, can be a problem.
 It's an even bigger problem for researchers and instructors who may have enormous data files that need to be managed, curated and analyzed.
 A new service at Purdue, however, called BoilerBackpack, will give students, faculty and staff 100 gigabytes of personal storage, so everyone at Purdue will have a large amount of space to store their digital stuff.
 Purdue and EMC Corp. are embarking on a five-year relationship that will both address the issue of where students and faculty can put their digital files, as well as develop solutions that can be adapted throughout higher education.
 "When we looked to solve our data management and storage issues, we wanted to look well beyond current practices and work to develop new solutions that can move science forward and improve student success," says 
Gerry McCartney, chief information officer, faculty member of the College of Technology at Purdue, and the Olga Oesterle England Professor of Information Technology.
 "EMC is the only corporation we talked to that had the capability to both address our current data storage needs and to partner with us to develop new technologies to improve data management.
" Purdue is naming EMC as one of its Foundational IT Partners, a group that includes Intel, HP, and Cisco. Foundational IT Partners work with the university in developing new technologies to be used in higher education and scientific discovery.
 The Purdue partnership fits well with EMC's goal of transforming IT, says Pat Gelsinger, President and Chief Operating Officer of EMC Information Infrastructure Products.
 "The amount of digital information in the world will grow forty-four fold this decade. And in some academic disciplines, such as bioinformatics, datasets have become so large that they defy the ability of conventional forms of information technology to store, manage, analyze, and gather important insights from them," Gelsinger says.
 "EMC's partnership with Purdue is designed to advance new technology architectures and algorithms to deal with the challenges of all of this Big Data.
" For faculty and students at Purdue, the most visible and immediate benefit of the agreement will be in place when they return for classes in the fall of 2012 with the launch of the BoilerBackpack service.
 The service will be similar to other popular cloud data services which typically offer between 2 GB to 7GB of free storage. Like those services, Backpack will allow students and faculty to sync files, access those files from any computer, and share files or folders with others.
 BoilerBackpack apps will be available for Android smartphones, Apple iPhones and iPads, as well as apps for Windows and Macintosh desktop computers.
 As with the commercial services, BoilerBackpack users will be able to purchase additional storage space if needed, and the university is exploring ways to allow students to continue to use the service after they graduate.
 "We'll announce specific details of the service as it launches in August, but we're pleased to offer our students and faculty a needed resource that they wouldn't find at this scale on any other campus," McCartney says.
 Beyond the cloud storage service for the Purdue community, EMC and Purdue will work together in several specific ways: * EMC and Purdue will jointly develop a new architecture for research data management and curation.
 * EMC and Purdue will work to develop new technologies to ingest, analyze, transfer and manage enormous research data sets, especially in the field of bioinformatics.
 * With EMC's assistance, Purdue will begin building a repository of all Purdue intellectual property. * Research engineers and scientists from both organizations will work together on academic papers and presentations, as well as presentations at trade conferences.
 The Purdue-EMC relationship is needed to address the challenges and opportunities of using data analysis of massive data sets – so called Big Data - to gain insights and forecast outcomes by both researchers and students at Purdue.
 Purdue has been a leader in using data sets to improve student success and retention with its Signals data analytics program. "Big Data will be to the next decade what the Internet was to the 1990s and early 2000s," McCartney says.
 "Over the next ten years it will change businesses and education in ways that we can't imagine right now. With this partnership we're positioning Purdue to be a leader in these changes.
" "Our Foundational IT Partner companies have not only committed to provide excellent products and service to Purdue, but they have also committed to work with us to develop technologies to speed the pace of scientific discoveries and to improve the rate of student success in higher education," McCartney says.
 "EMC is exactly the kind of company we are looking to partner with in this effort, and because we will be advancing data science, this relationship has the potential to change every market that uses the Internet.

 Expert: Back-to-school buying starting now
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Retailers can expect back-to-school shoppers to be gearing up right now, says Richard Feinberg, a Purdue University professor of consumer sciences and retailing.
 Feinberg says consumers typically begin back-to-school shopping three to four weeks before the school year begins. In some parts of the county, school opens in mid-August.
 "It's likely half of consumers will do some back-to-school shopping online," Feinberg says. "And those shoppers will start early to allow for shipping time.
 That probably moves up the start of their shopping by at least a week." Back-to-school is second only to the Christmas holiday season in importance to retailers.
 Feinberg estimates it will be an $84 billion season this year. Helping fuel sales are relatively lower gasoline prices, he says.
 "Every penny saved on a gallon of gas translates to $1 billion dollars available for retail spending." Feinberg says two of the biggest products for back-to-school are backpacks and laptops.
 "Spending on electronics will be almost as high as apparel," he says.

 Extreme drought spreads across Indiana, but relief in sight
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - While drought conditions worsened in much of Indiana the past week, there is potentially good news on the horizon: rainfall chances for the remainder of July are improving.
 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center moved Indiana out of the below-normal rainfall category into normal for the next two weeks.
 "This is something that hasn't been forecast in a long time," said Ken Scheeringa, associate state climatologist based at Purdue University.
 "This is encouraging news." July annually is the wettest month of the year in Indiana, averaging 4.10 inches of rain. Scheeringa noted that parts of Indiana received heavy rainfall Thursday (July 19).
 Scorching heat, however, is expected to continue at least through July. "Extreme, high temperatures don't appear to be going away soon," Scheeringa said.
 Indiana hasn't received much rain this summer because a high-pressure system essentially shut off the flow of humidity and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to Indiana and the Midwest.
 "The air was very dry, and incoming fronts had virtually no moisture to work with to produce rain showers," Scheeringa said. "Cold fronts from our north and west are reaching Indiana more often and can use this atmospheric moisture to trigger rainfall that is gradually increasing in amounts and area coverage," Scheeringa said.
 Still, the U.S. Drought Monitor update on Thursday (July 19) painted a worsening picture of drought conditions in Indiana in the past week.
 Three areas of extreme drought - the second-highest level of dryness - in last week's drought map now are joined in one large area that stretches from the southwest to the northeast corners, encompassing 54 percent of the state.
 The remainder of the counties are in other levels of drought. Parts of Vanderburgh and Posey counties in the Evansville area along the Ohio River remained in exceptional drought, the highest level of dryness.
 Indiana is 7.56 inches below normal precipitation so far for the year. The state typically gets 22.8 inches July 19. More information about the drought is available on the Purdue Extension drought website at

 Sophie Lelièvre, the 2012 faculty fellow for the Discovery Learning Research Center and a College of Veterinary Medicine professor, is leading the effort to educate and focus the attention of researchers on the little-studied field of preventative medicine.
 "My goal is to develop a learning system across disciplines on primary prevention of breast cancer to facilitate the design of multidisciplinary research projects among scholars and prepare future scholars for interdisciplinary and international work in public health," Lelièvre said.
 Lelièvre (pronounced Le-LEE-YEA-vre) believes that primary prevention research is underrepresented in the scientific community.
 Her proposal for a distance-learning program was intended to correct this by exposing a large number of college science students across many universities to the current state of the research.
 Future members of the scientific community are drawn from this pool, so this should result in a greater awareness and representation of this field.
 Currently, Lelièvre is studying the development and behavior of both normal and cancerous cells, using a three-dimensional culture that permits the architectural mimicry of physiologically relevant tissue.
 In particular, this culturing method allows her to study the effect of polarity - the way cells organize themselves to make certain structures face certain directions - on the development of tumors.
 Her laboratory also examines how the genome of cells is affected by the organization of cell components in the nucleus in relation to tissue architecture.
 "Most of those who study cancer use already-cancerous cells for their research. In primary prevention research, you start with normal cells to see how they become abnormal," said Lelièvre, who also is associate director of Discovery Groups for the Purdue Center for Cancer Research.
 Lelièvre, who also co-leads the International Breast Cancer and Nutrition Project (IBCN), said this course was piloted in 2010, and she is now working with Purdue anthropology professor Ellen Gruenbaum.
 "This project serves the mission that the Discovery Learning Research Center has set to impact a global community by fostering the development of a large-scale interdisciplinary program focused on breast cancer prevention," said center director Gabriela Weaver.
 "It involves many disciplines in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and its goal is to promote learning in public health issues with translational research impact and the potential to influence educational policies across the globe.
" Lelièvre and Connie Weaver, distinguished professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue, lead the multinational IBCN to learn more about the role that diet and other environmental factors can play to promote or prevent this disease.
 Involving the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IBCN is focusing initial efforts on the United States and Ghana as well as France, Japan, Uruguay and Lebanon.
 Its annual conference returns to the Purdue campus on Oct. 10-12. Lebanon is scheduled to host the 2013 conference. Purdue hosted the inaugural conference in 2010, and France was host in 2011.
 Through the project launched in 2010, each country has a dedicated research team focused on a number of milestones and allows scientists to study worldwide diversity in breast cancer rates, dietary patterns and cultural contexts.
 A native of France, Lelièvre earned her doctorate in veterinary medicine from the University of Louvain in Belgium in 1990 and her doctorate in cancer pharmacology in 1995 from the University of Paris VI.
 Lelièvre, who has been a Purdue faculty member since 2000, also earned a master's degree in law, health and ethics in 2008 from the University of Rennes I in partnership with the School of Public Health in France.
 Purdue's Discovery Learning Research Center advances research and innovation that revolutionizes learning in the STEM disciplines.
 Research involving learning spaces, both physical and virtual, are a cornerstone of activities in the center's new building, the Hall for Discovery and Learning Research.
 Since its 2003 launch, the center has catalyzed and collaborated on projects, receiving research funding of nearly $80 million focused on the science of learning, design of innovative educational programs and development of interactive learning technologies.
 It also leads more than 30 projects involving 180 faculty members from every Purdue college and school and has established collaborations with more than 50 external partners.

 Fall and winter weather outlook in Indiana: Something for everyone?

Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Now that the dreadfully hot and dry summer is behind us, we might be wondering what to expect for the fall and coming winter in Indiana.
 A variable temperature and precipitation pattern is developing this fall, with September so far a cool and wet month. Indiana average temperatures have run nearly two degrees below normal while precipitation has ranged from near normal in the northern third of the state to more than twice normal in central counties, according to the 
State Climate Office, based at Purdue University. Temperatures could remain cool through early October but may turn warm later in the month.
 The warm weather pattern could continue through November. The wet trend is forecast to continue through the next two weeks, but conditions drier than normal could prevail for October as a whole.
 The precipitation outlook for November is less certain, with equal chances of precipitation above, normal or below normal at this point.
 And what about winter? For now, it's "wait and watch," said State Climatologist Dev Niyogi. Climatologists are waiting to see how an El Niño develops and how the Arctic Oscillation might influence weather patterns.
 "An El Niño generally increases the chances of a warmer and drier Indiana winter, but there is just too much at play at this time, making an outlook challenging," Niyogi said.
 Early indications are that an El Niño will develop in early fall. "However, this El Niño is now expected to be weak and slow to develop, and other factors, such as the Arctic Oscillation and the persistence of the unusual weather patterns we had over the past months, can play a greater role," he said.
 The average weather in individual months can be expected to be more erratic depending on which seasonal element dominates, Niyogi said.
 "One month could be warmer than normal and the following colder," he said. "This high variability will be key as we move into winter this year.
 So it's probably going to be more like a little bit of everything this time around." Winter weather in Indiana is regulated by elements such as oceanic patterns, including Pacific Ocean surface temperatures and wind circulation around the North Pole.
 Last year, many forecasters thought Indiana would have a winter similar to that of the previous year: very cold and lots of snow, based in part on how the Arctic Oscillation could have developed.
 But the weather patterns shifted and moved into a phase that brought warmer air and little snow. "Recently, we have seen unusual seasonal patterns: the very early start to spring, hot summer and historic drought," Niyogi said.
 "What climatology tells us alone will not be the final answer to this winter. My best advice at this stage would be to wait and watch.
 Sometimes the signals are just not strong enough to make any confident projections - and during a transition such as we are going through with a likely El Niño, change is in the air.
 We just don't know which way and how far off from normal the weather will be." Niyogi said the State Climate Office will continue to monitor weather patterns and issue another outlook when it has more significant, updated information.

 Farmers on the lookout for aflatoxin as drought continues
 Extreme heat and drought have created prime growing conditions for Aspergillus ear rot in corn. The fungus produces aflatoxin, a toxic carcinogen that also can cause health problems in livestock.
 (Purdue University photo/Charles Woloshuk)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The season-long drought and extreme heat have created conditions prime for Aspergillus ear rot to develop in corn, so growers should scout their fields and inspect their grain, a Purdue Extension plant pathologist says.
 The fungus, which infects corn ears through the silks or wounds, produces aflatoxin, a toxic carcinogen that also can cause health problems for livestock that consume contaminated corn.
 "Aspergillus ear rot is out there, but it varies greatly from field to field, mostly depending on planting time and environmental conditions at pollination," Kiersten Wise said.
 "There is no field without some potential for the disease." Fields most at risk are those in which corn was planted in late March to early April, due to the high temperatures and drought stress that occurred when that corn was pollinating.
 Even if corn was planted later in April, it is still at risk if it was under extreme drought stress during pollination, planted in sandy soils or experienced insect and hail damage.
 "Producers should scout fields prior to harvest and determine the level of incidence of the disease in the field," Wise said. If growers suspect the disease, they can submit grain samples to Purdue's 
Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, for aflatoxin analysis. This lab routinely screens samples for aflatoxin. The U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates how much aflatoxin can be in finished livestock feed and corn for human consumption.
 Regulations vary by species but are especially tight for consumption by humans and dairy cattle, at 20 parts per billion. Regulations for other species are:
 Grain elevators are likely to reject loads of corn that exceed government regulations, or they could penalize producers by docking the price.
 "At this point in the season, there are no management strategies for reducing ear rots in fields that will remain for grain production," Wise said.
 But she and several of her Purdue Extension colleagues teamed up to offer some strategies to help keep the aflatoxin issue from worsening:
 * Harvest corn as early as possible. Late-season rains can increase mold growth and aflatoxin levels. * Dry grain to less than 15 percent moisture.
 Make sure to dry grain promptly to keep aflatoxin problems from getting worse. * Remove fine material. Fines often contain higher toxin levels than the grain and can interfere with drying and aeration.
 * Clean equipment inside and out before and after use. Moldy or insect-infested kernels can contaminate next year's crop. A compilation of free Purdue Extension resources for managing moldy corn is available at 
http://www.purdue.edu/cornmold Purdue Extension also teamed up with the Indiana Corn Marketing Council to produce the free publication "Managing Aspergillus Ear Rot and Aflatoxin.
" The publication, ID-451-W, is available through the Education Store at http://www.extension.purdue.edu/store or by calling 888-EXT-INFO (888-398-4636).

 Field day to focus on farm management to increase productivity 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The Indiana Integrated Resource Management Program's 10th annual field day will be an opportunity for producers to learn how small changes in farm management practices can improve production.
 The Aug. 8 event will be 2-5:30 p.m. at Brooks Farm Inc., 2375 East State Route 16, Monon. It's free and open to the public, but an optional catered dinner will follow for $10.
 Integrated Resource Management, or IRM, is about stepping back and looking at the bigger picture of farming, said Mark Hilton, clinical professor in the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine.
 It focuses on more effective animal care, financial decisions and most appropriate farmland use. "Fundamentally, IRM examines how producers can better position themselves for success," he said.
 "The top producers are not satisfied with where they are. They are looking forward to the next year, and the next year. And they're asking hard questions.
" Hilton said the Brooks farm is a prime example of how improvements grounded in these principles can boost production and promote animal wellness.
 The farm, which has participated in IRM since the early 1990s, shows how gradual changes can improve the success and productivity of an operation.
 Purdue veterinary medicine experts, and Natural Resources Conservation Service experts will give presentations on the drought situation, pasture management and heterosis (breeding for better performance) in cattle.
 Attendees will be able to ask experts about specific individual operations. They also will have the chance to talk with other farmers about what's working on other farms.
 Participants should register ahead of time to the Purdue Large Animal Hospital at 765-494-8548. Payment for the dinner is due at the time of registration.

 Fireworks danger heightened by drought conditions
 Daniel Lytle, who manages a TNT Fireworks stand near Frankfort, Ind., says consumers must be extremely careful when igniting fireworks this summer because of very dry grasses caused by drought.
 (Purdue Agriculture Communication photo/Tom Campbell) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The hot, dry conditions Indiana is experiencing this summer make fireworks especially hazardous.
 Dry grasses, forests and fields are especially combustible because of the drought conditions across Indiana, said Steve Creech, a retired state fire coordinator and lecturer for Purdue University's 
Department for Forestry and Natural Resources. "Normally when you shoot off a firework and it lands in someone else's yard, that's not too big of a risk, but that's not the case this year," Creech said.
 "With the drought we're experiencing, there's a heightened risk of fireworks starting a fire off-site and spreading quickly." Those grasses and other easily combustible items are known as "fine, flashy fuels," and Creech said they pose a risk to start a fire that can get out of control quickly.
 "They will ignite very easily, and they will spread rapidly, especially if there's a wind behind them," Creech said. "Sometimes they'll spread faster than a person can walk.
 Those fires can get to structures before anyone has time to react." Creech suggested that anyone shooting off fireworks find an area such as a large parking lot that is paved and nowhere near combustible materials.
 Better than that, even, would be to wait until after a prolonged, soaking rain can add more moisture to the ground and vegetation to reduce the risk.
 Other unattended or discarded sources are also at heightened risk for causing fires, Creech said. Discarded cigarettes are more likely to ignite grasses, and campfires or other open burning sources could send embers quite a distance while remaining viable sources of combustion.
 "We're seeing conditions now that people haven't seen before," Creech said. "There's a possibility for significant loss if people aren't extremely careful with fireworks.

 Football findings suggest concussions caused by series of hits
 Members of the Jefferson High School football team, seen here during a practice last season, were monitored in research to learn how impacts to the head affect brain function.
 (Purdue University file photo/Andrew Hancock)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A two-year study of high school football players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head, as commonly believed.
Purdue University researchers have studied football players for two seasons at Jefferson High School in Lafayette, Ind., where 21 players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season, including 16 repeating players.
Helmet-sensor impact data from each player were compared with brain-imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before, during and after each season.
"The most important implication of the new findings is the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow, but it's really the totality of blows that took place over the season," said 
Eric Nauman, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and an expert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma.
 "The one hit that brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel's back."Researchers evaluated players using a type of brain imaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, along with a computer-based neurocognitive screening test.
 The fMRI scans reveal which parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks.Thomas Talavage, an expert in functional neuroimaging and co-director of the Purdue MRI Facility, said the scans indicate players are adapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes.
"The changes in brain activity we are observing suggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task, and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced," Talavage said.
 "The level of change in the fMRI signal is significantly correlated to the number and distribution of hits that a player takes. Performance doesn't change, but brain activity changes, showing that certain areas are no longer being recruited to perform a task.
" Brain scans show differences among high school football players in a two-year study that suggests concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head, as commonly believed.
 (Purdue University image/Thomas Talavage)Download Photo Findings, detailed in a paper to appear online in the Journal of Biomechanics, are contrary to conventional thinking.
"Most clinicians would say that if you don't have any concussion symptoms you have no problems," said Larry Leverenz, an expert in athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology.
 "However, we are finding that there is actually a lot of change, even when you don't have symptoms."The paper was written by mechanical engineering graduate student Evan Breedlove, Nauman, Leverenz, Talavage, former Purdue professor of educational studies Jeffrey Gilger, biomedical engineering graduate student Meghan Robinson, health and kinesiology graduate student Katherine E.
 Morigaki, electrical and computer engineering graduate student Umit Yoruk, mechanical engineering undergraduate student Kyle O'Keefe, and undergraduate student in electrical and computer engineering Jeffrey King.
 Gilger is now a researcher at the University of California, Merced.The research may help to determine how many blows it takes to cause impairment, which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting the number of hits a player receives per week.
"Any change in fMRI data is a concern, but we don't yet know what these changes mean, what they translate to, in terms of cognitive impairment," Breedlove said.
A common assumption in sports medicine is that certain people are innately more susceptible to head injury. However, the new findings suggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the most important factor, Talavage said.
"Over the two seasons we had six concussed players, but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not have concussions," Talavage said.
 "There is good correlation with the number of hits players received, but we need more subjects."The researchers have expanded the study to include an additional high school football team and girls' soccer.
"We want to increase the number of football players in the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don't wear head protection," Nauman said.
 "We also want to include girls to see whether they are affected differently than boys."The research findings represent a dilemma because they suggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose.
"This might be especially important in young people because the brain is still developing, so even though subtle unexpressed damage doesn't manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life," Gilger said.
Changes were seen in regions of the brain that have been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and other forms of head injury.
"This is still circumstantial evidence, but it suggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as a result of all these hits, and the regions most affected are the ones that exhibit CTE," Nauman said.
Players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1,900 hits to the head in a single season, with two players exceeding 1,800 hits.
 Helmet-sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 Gs to more than 100 Gs."The worst hit we've seen was almost 300 Gs," Nauman said.
A soccer player "heading" a ball experiences an impact of about 20 Gs.Findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive and accurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions; more accurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from head impacts; determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a single impact or repeated impacts; and develop new interventions to reduce the risk and effects of head impacts.
"Now that we know there is definitely a buildup of damage before the concussion occurs, ultimately, there is hope that we can do more to prevent concussions," Nauman said.
The work is ongoing and supported with grants from the Indiana State Department of Health's Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Fund, General Electric Healthcare, the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, and through the National Science Foundation and National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowships.
Researchers also will follow the case studies of players who take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes in brain structure using MRI scans.
The research group, called the Purdue Neurotrauma Group (PNG), also is studying ways to reduce traumatic brain injury in soldiers who suffer concussions caused by shock waves from explosions.

enauman@purdue.eduConcussion is growing public health issue in the United States, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is the chief long-term concern linked to repeated concussions.
 Recently, attention has shifted toward subconcussive blows and the role they may play in the development of CTE. We assembled a cohort of high school football players for two seasons of observation.
 Accelerations sensors were placed in the helmets, and all contact activity was monitored. Pre-season computer-based neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests were also obtained in order to assess cognitive and physiological health.
 In-season follow-up scans were then obtained both from individuals who had sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion and those who had not.
 These changes were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan.
 In addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion, a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes.
 Stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the biomechanical histories of subjects and the ensuing neurophysiological change, suggesting that distinct injury processes are at play.
 Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that the effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative and that repeated exposure to subconcussive blows is connected to pathologically altered neurophysiology.

 Forage crops could provide opportunities following corn
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A wide range of forage crops could help grain and livestock producers salvage some value from their fields once the drought-ravaged corn crop has been harvested - if soil moisture returns to a level that can support plant growth.
 While damaged corn can be used as forage to feed livestock, it won't be enough to thwart forage shortages. Several forage crops are available for Indiana growers to plant in late summer or early fall, and that could serve as livestock feed in the spring.
 "For the August seeding, an excellent consideration would be spring oat that will be harvested by machine, or a combination of spring oat and forage turnip if grazed by livestock," said Keith Johnson, Purdue Extension forage specialist.
 "Spring oat will not survive the winter. "While the expectation is for turnips to winterkill, too, it has been observed that they can survive a mild Indiana winter.
" Another possible choice is annual ryegrass, but growers who go this route need to pay close attention to keep the crop from becoming a nuisance.
 Johnson recommended an early seeding to have both fall and spring harvests. "Carefully selected varieties of soft red winter wheat, winter cereal rye and winter triticale are adapted across the state of Indiana," Johnson said.
 "These crops can be lightly grazed in the fall if weather conditions favor growth, and there is an expectation to produce more abundant forage the following spring.
" While some farmers might be tempted to select a winter barley, Johnson said it's not as winter-hardy as some of the other small grains.
 A major factor in selecting a forage crop to follow corn is the type of herbicides used on the cornfield. Herbicides are labeled with restrictions because some residuals can damage a forage crop seeding.
 Most herbicide labels do not specifically list the species that are used for cover crops or fall forages, so these species often fall under the "other crops" listed section at the maximum restriction period, said Travis Legleiter, Purdue Extension weed scientist.
 "These restrictions are meant to protect the rotation crop, and the end consumers and livestock consuming the harvested crop," he said.
 More information about herbicide restrictions is available in Purdue Extension's free publication, "Cover Crops and the Corn and Soybean Herbicide Rotational Restrictions," available at 
http://www.btny.purdue.edu/WeedScience/2011/CoverCrops11.pdf Purdue Extension's "Midwest Cover Crops Field Guide" also can help farmers decide which crops would be most appropriate.
 If the crops are used as forage, and not just to provide cover, Johnson suggests seeding at the earlier time frames noted in the publication.
 The guide can be purchased at http://www.the-education-store.com or by calling (888) EXT-INFO (398-4636) and asking for The Education Store.

 Freshman, grad student enrollment up in College of Agriculture
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Enrollment in the Purdue University College of Agriculture increased slightly for the 2012-13 academic year, led by higher numbers of freshmen and graduate students.
 Figures released by the university show a college enrollment of 3,289, compared with 3,283 last year. Agriculture students represent 8.4 percent of the 39,256 students at Purdue's West Lafayette campus.
 "Enrollments across agriculture and related majors remains strong, and interest continues to grow as evidenced by the size of the incoming class," said Marcos Fernandez, associate dean and director of academic programs.
 Freshman enrollment is 499, up 3.3 percent from last fall's incoming class. Graduate student enrollment grew from 596 to 631 in that same period.
 "This is an exciting time for students coming into agriculture because the opportunities that are out there for them continue to expand," Fernandez said.
 "Students come to Purdue to prepare for careers that touch the breadth and diversity of agriculture. "Those careers could be anything from feeding the world, to developing new energy sources, to public health, to climate issues, to food safety, to economic and community development, to diseases, to sustainability of our landscape and natural resources, to new discoveries in science.
 They can prepare for careers in those areas - and more - at Purdue." The 2011-12 graduating class was the largest in the past decade, with 86 percent moving on to jobs or graduate school, Fernandez said.
 "Purdue Agriculture continues to seek students committed to making a difference, and we encourage them to take a look at the educational opportunities that make us one of the premier and most widely recognized agriculture colleges in the world," he said.
 Agriculture students can choose from among 31 major and 22 minor areas of study within the departments of agricultural and biological engineering, agricultural economics, agronomy, animal sciences, biochemistry, botany and plant pathology, entomology, food science, forestry and natural resources, horticulture and landscape architecture, and youth development and agricultural education.

 Friendships, community ties will aid those in hurricane path
 Aldrich can discuss how people behave and rely on each other after natural disasters such as hurricanes. He has found that people who have stronger individual friendships, community connections and civic involvement are more likely to have access to resources and information during and after a disaster.
 Aldrich is author of the new book "Building Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery," which includes a study of the recovery of various neighborhoods after Hurricane Katrina.
 "The lesson learned from Hurricane Katrina is to stockpile friends, because people who survive and then return to rebuild their community after a disaster are more likely to do so because of their relationships and personal connections," Aldrich says.
 Aldrich also has studied disaster recovery and community rebuilding following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in Tamil Nadu, the 1923 earthquake in Tokyo and the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan.
 Aldrich, who was a professor at Tulane University when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, credits a neighbor with encouraging his family to evacuate as the storm approached.
 He continues to work with colleagues at Louisiana State University to study disaster recovery after the hurricane, as well as after the April 2010 oil spill.
 Aldrich and his colleagues are observing high rates of depression, domestic violence and divorce as they interview area residents since the Gulf spill.

 Gene's function may give new target for cancer drugs
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University scientists have determined that a gene long known to be involved in cancer cell formation and chemotherapy resistance is key to proper RNA creation, an understanding that could one day lead to new therapies and drug targets.
 The human gene p68 has long been recognized as an oncogene, one associated with cancer formation, but its function was unknown. Elizabeth Tran, a Purdue biochemist, found that misregulation of p68 causes problems with RNA formation and arrangement, possibly leading to chromosomal abnormalities.
 Tran, whose findings were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, used a gene in baker's yeast - Dbp2 – as a model to understand p68's function.
 "Our results show that Dbp2, and likely p68, functions in proper formation of RNA. Our evidence suggests that Dbp2 keeps the RNA from folding improperly," Tran said.
 "We think that misfolded RNA may not be released from the DNA, causing problems with the DNA itself." Genes send instructions to proteins to carry out functions.
 To do that, DNA is decoded into RNA, which then take that code to proteins. Tran found that Dbp2 is a crucial part of that RNA creation process.
 Both Dbp2 and p68 encode an enzyme called an RNA helicase. The RNA helicase enzyme controls the structure and arrangement of RNA, which must be separated from DNA before it takes instructions to proteins.
 In this case, Tran showed that misregulated Dbp2 and p68 cause defects in DNA, most likely from incorrect separation of RNA from the DNA.
 DNA that doesn't fold properly is vulnerable to chromosomes breaking or fusing, problems known to cause a host of diseases. "The hallmark of cancer is aberrant or even broken DNA," Tran said.
 "If this process is important for RNA structure and DNA integrity, we may have found a clue as to why misregulation of P68 causes cancer.
" Although the study does not address the connection between p68 and cancer, it lays the foundation for future studies. Next, Tran plans to use biochemical experiments to determine exactly how Dbp2 works in a cell and what changes it makes to RNA.
 "We need to know what RNAs are recognized by Dbp2 to find how specific genes are affected," Tran said. "We also need to discover what other proteins may function in similar processes and simply haven't been discovered to date.
" The National Institutes of Health, Purdue Agriculture and the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, of which Tran is a member, funded the work.
 Tran's study was published as a paper of the week in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, with an author profile of Sara C. Cloutier, the paper's first author and Tran's laboratory research assistant.
 The DEAD-box RNA Helicase Dbp2 Connects RNA Quality Control with Repression of Aberrant Transcription DEAD-box proteins are a class of RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis enzymes that rearrange RNA and RNA-protein (ribo- nucleoprotein) complexes.
 In an effort to characterize the cellular function of individual DEAD-box proteins, our laboratory has uncovered a previously unrecognized link between the DEAD-box protein Dbp2 and the regulation of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
 Here, we report that Dbp2 is a double-stranded RNA-specific ATPase that associates directly with chromatin and is required for transcriptional fidelity.
 In fact, loss of DBP2 results in multiple gene expression defects, including accumulation of noncoding transcripts, inefficient end formation, and appearance of aberrant transcriptional initiation products.
 We also show that loss of DBP2 is synthetic lethal with deletion of the nuclear RNA decay factor, RRP6, pointing to a global role for Dbp2 in prevention of aberrant transcriptional products.
 Taken together, we present a model whereby Dbp2 functions to cotranscriptionally modulate RNA structure, a process that facilitates ribonucleoprotein assembly and clearance of transcripts from genomic loci.
 These studies suggest that Dbp2 is a missing link in RNA quality control that functions to maintain the fidelity of transcriptional processes.

 Global food security center hires manager, receives grants
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The recently created Center for Global Food Security at Purdue University has hired a managing director and received grants totaling $10 million for work to improve crops in Africa and train the next generation of global food security experts.
 Gary Burniske, who had been director of Mercy Corps operations in Bogotá, Colombia, since 2006, will run daily operations of the center at Discovery Park, a complex of organizations leading large-scale collaborative research on campus engaging faculty, students and industry in state, national and global partnerships and entrepreneurial education.
"I envision the center being a catalyst for dramatic improvements in food security by sharing the tremendous wealth of knowledge and innovation generated at Purdue University," said Burniske, who started his new position Feb.
 1. "I look forward to working with the Discovery Park team to achieve Purdue's vision as a global leader for solutions to social, economic and environmental challenges we face.
"Burniske's appointment comes at a time when the center, established in 2011, will begin work on two major projects that have received significant funding and align with two of the center's core mission areas - research and education:
* A four-year, multidisciplinary research and development program on the control of the parasitic Striga weed, which infests sorghum and other crops in Africa, damaging or destroying them.
 The center received a $5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to further research and establish programs for a sustainable Striga control and institutional development effort in the African nations of Tanzania and Ethiopia.
* A five-year effort to train U.S. graduate students in food security and global development in the fields of agriculture and natural resources.
 The U.S. Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security program is funded by a $5 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Both projects align with the center's objectives to advance global food security and develop leaders with the skills to help solve the world's hunger problems amid a growing population, said university President France A.
 Córdova."Forging such large-scale partnerships goes to the core of Purdue's commitment to provide innovative, research-based solutions to problems facing our global society," Córdova said.
 "Purdue's Center for Global Food Security is rising to that challenge."The Striga research will build on the work of Gebisa Ejeta, the center's director and distinguished professor of agronomy who received the World Food Prize in 2009 for developing sorghum varieties resistant to drought and Striga in his native Africa, where sorghum is a major crop.
The new effort will focus on furthering knowledge of biological interactions between Striga and sorghum through research in chemistry, molecular genetics and crop improvement.
"In the previous research, we focused on controlling Striga through manipulation of resistance genes in the host plant," Ejeta said.
 "Now we will expand the research to explore the role of virulence genes in the pathogen to avoid catastrophic breakdown of resistance.
"Shorter-term solutions will involve establishing sustainable Striga control programs by adapting previously piloted Striga management technologies to the variety of environments and livelihoods of small-scale farmers in highly infested regions of Ethiopia and Tanzania.
Ejeta will direct the project, which will include Tesfaye Mengiste, a Purdue professor of botany and plant pathology, and Harro Bouwmeester, who heads the Laboratory of Plant Physiology at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
 They will collaborate with the agriculture ministries in Ethiopia and Tanzania.The Borlaug fellowship program will consist of:* A two-week Summer Institute on Global Food Security for 20-30 beginning graduate students.
 The training will provide an understanding of the array of issues involving food security. It will be conducted annually on the Purdue campus.
* A dissertation research opportunity for U.S. graduate students to work in developing countries for 6-24 months, laying foundations for new and long-term collaborative research in food and natural resource systems between African nations and the United States.
"Aptly named, the program is an ambitious effort to produce the next generation's Norman Borlaugs for the fight against hunger and to advance global development," said Ejeta, referring to the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize-winning plant scientist and humanitarian.
The Borlaug program will be administered by Ejeta, Burniske and Rose Filley, managing director of Purdue's Global Sustainability Initiative.

 Glyphosate-resistant 'superweeds' may be less susceptible to diseases
 Purdue scientists found that soil microbes may play a role in how those weeds react to the popular herbicide glyphosate. Here, glyphosate-susceptible biotypes of giant ragweed react differently to the herbicide.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Scientists searching for clues to understand how superweeds obtain resistance to the popular herbicide glyphosate may have been missing a critical piece of information, a Purdue University study shows.
 Glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weed killer sold under the name RoundUp, is the most widely used herbicide in the United States, but some plants have grown resistant to it.
 This has caused farmers to turn to additional herbicides. While the mechanisms that have led to resistance are not fully known, Bill Johnson, a professor of weed science; Steve Hallett, an associate professor of weed science; and Jessica Schafer, a graduate student in botany and plant pathology, believe that soil microbes may play a role.
 Most laboratory tests done to understand glyphosate resistance are done in sterile soil, void of those microbes. Schafer said Purdue's findings, published online early in the journal 
Weed Science, show that those microbes may play a significant role in how glyphosate affects plants. "The soil you're growing the plants in is important to the results," Schafer said.
 "If we're growing in a sterile media, we could get some false positive results because the plants are more tolerant to glyphosate in those conditions.
" Hallett and Schafer grew giant ragweed, horseweed and common lambsquarter in both sterile soil and field soil and subjected them to glyphosate.
 In each soil, strains of weeds both susceptible and resistant to glyphosate were tested. Both versions of giant ragweed were damaged more from the glyphosate in field soil.
 The susceptible version of common lambsquarter was also more heavily damaged in field soil. Horseweed fared the same no matter which soil or strain - susceptible or resistant.
 The results show that microbes can play an important role in the activity of glyphosate, presumably by invading the glyphosate-weakened plants.
 The results also suggest that glyphosate-resistant weeds may be more resistant to disease pressure as well. "Soil microbes can be minor to major contributors to how glyphosate is able to affect plants," Hallett said.
 "We may be selecting not only for glyphosate resistance, but inadvertently selecting for weeds that have disease resistance as well.
" A weed's ability to withstand glyphosate was based on dry shoot and root weight after testing. The sterile soil used in the study came from field soil exposed to gamma radiation to kill microbes and bacteria.
 The irradiated soil was tested to ensure that its nutrients were not diminished. Hallett, Johnson and Schafer said further studies would look at how fungi in the soil affect root development, both with and without glyphosate.
 "Dirt is a living organism," Johnson said. "It's important to know how all the pieces interact." The research was conducted with internal funding from Purdue's Department of Botany and Plant Pathology.
 Response of Giant Ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), Horseweed (Conyza canadensis), and Common Lambsquarter (Chenopodium album) Biotypes to Glyphosate in the Presence and Absence of Soil Microorganisms
 In previous research conducted on non-weed species, the efficacy of glyphosate was shown to be greater in unsterile soils compared to sterile soils, and that soil microorganisms played an important role in glyphosate efficacy.
 Conducting greenhouse studies in microbe-free soil may, therefore, produce unreliable data, leading to erroneous conclusions. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of soil microorganisms on the response of glyphosate-resistant and -susceptible biotypes of three problematic weeds of the Midwestern United States: giant ragweed, horseweed and common lambsquarters.
 A greenhouse dose-response study was conducted on each of the three weed species grown in sterile and unsterile field soil, and the dry weight response of roots and shoots was measured.
 The three weed species responded differently to glyphosate when grown in the sterile and unsterile soil, that is, in the presence and absence of soil microbes.
 Soil microbes influenced the response of the susceptible and resistant giant ragweed biotypes and the susceptible common lambsquarters, but not on the tolerant common lambsquarters or either horseweed biotype.
 The different response of the three species to glyphosate in the presence and absence of soil microbes demonstrates that rhizosphere interactions are fundamental to the mode of action of glyphosate.
 These findings suggest that the range of tolerance to glyphosate observed in weeds and the evolution of resistance in weed biotypes may also be influenced by rhizosphere interactions.
 The soil media used in dose-response screenings to identify susceptible and resistant weed biotypes is very important. Unsterile field soil should be incorporated into growth media when conducting dose-response screenings to avoid false positive results.
 In addition, researchers performing glyphosate dose-response assays should be aware of these findings.

 Glyphosate-resistant weeds found in multiple Indiana counties
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – As the summer drought continues, farmers across Indiana are struggling to control glyphosate-resistant weeds, says a Purdue Extension specialist.
 Farmers are seeing marestail, giant ragweed and common waterhemp throughout their fields this year, and the hot, dry weather is making it more difficult to get a firm grip on controlling them.
 According to Bill Johnson, marestail and giant ragweed are spread widely around the state. Waterhemp is mainly seen in southwest, northwest and east-central Indiana and glyphosate-resistant populations have now been confirmed in nine counties.
 Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth has been confirmed in one county. Although glyphosate-resistant marestail is the primary concern in 2012 and can be found in most counties where soybeans are grown, waterhemp and giant ragweed are of growing importance.
 "We didn't get winterkill for the populations that emerged in the fall," he said. "The ones that emerged this spring emerged very early and, because of the warm weather conditions, were able to grow unabated, and quickly became too large to control with labeled herbicide rates.
" Glyphosate-resistant broadleaf weeds are a greater problem in soybean fields than in cornfields because there are fewer herbicides to control broadleaf weeds in a broadleaf crop such as soybean.
 In addition, the drought is causing the weeds to dry out and curl up, making it less sensitive to herbicides. Johnson said that as weeds show glyphosate resistance, farmers are turning to older herbicides - something he said is feasible but requires a lot of work and fine-tuning.
 Although crops that have a resistance to older broadleaf herbicides such as 2,4-D and dicamba are being developed, Johnson said it will be a few years before we are able to use them.
 Farmers in the southeast portion of Indiana saw a severe case of glyphosate-resistant weeds 10 years ago. The problem gradually spread.
 Five years ago, glyphosate-resistant weeds became a statewide problem. Johnson said farmers should scout fields to determine where glyphosate-resistant weeds are worst, and know if the current treatment plan is effective.
 More information about glyphosate-resistant weeds is available in a series of publications from Purdue Extension - The Education Store at

 Greater Lafayette libraries now offer searchable database of grants, funding
 LAFAYETTE, Ind. and WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Finding grants and funding opportunities in sectors as diverse as the arts, the sciences and community services may prove easier in Tippecanoe County with the purchase and installation of a searchable database in four Greater Lafayette libraries.
 The Community Foundation of Greater Lafayette and United Way of Greater Lafayette sponsored the installation of GrantSelect. GrantSelect has more than 16,000 unique funding opportunities to help individuals and organizations more easily find and access federal, state and local grant opportunities.
 Schoolhouse Partners LLC, based in the Purdue Research Park, manages and commercializes the database. Greg Kapp, president and CEO of The Community Foundation of Greater Lafayette, said the organization assists individuals and groups that are looking to give back to the community.
 "The Tippecanoe County Public Library system and the West Lafayette Public Library serve the community by providing quality content in their print, multimedia and digital collections," he said.
 "The foundation supports the libraries because the libraries support us all." James Taylor, CEO of United Way of Greater Lafayette, said bringing GrantSelect to Tippecanoe County libraries aligns with the organization's mission.
 "Our mission is to mobilize our community to improve lives," he said. "When individuals and organizations have the resources to successfully carry out their goals, our community is strengthened.
 The GrantSelect database is another resource that can help achieve that end result." Louis S. Schafer, editorial director of Schoolhouse Partners, said GrantSelect includes all grant opportunities listed in Schoolhouse Partners' print directories: Directory of Research Grants, Directory of Biomedical and Health Care Grants, Directory of Grants in the Humanities, Funding Sources for K-12 Education, Funding Sources for Children and Youth Programs, Funding Sources for Community and Economic Development, Operating Grants for Nonprofit Organizations, and Funding Sources for Faith-Based Programs.
 "These opportunities can be used for programs, planning, start-up, endowments, technical assistance, facilities and equipment, and other projects," Schafer said.
 "We're very happy to work with local community partners to help Greater Lafayette grow." GrantSelect has been installed at all three locations in the Tippecanoe County Public Library system and the West Lafayette Public Library:
 Individuals with a valid user name and password also can access the GrantSelect database through the Tippecanoe County Public Library website (http://www.tcpl.lib.in.us/databases) and the 
West Lafayette Public Library website. Jos N. Holman, country librarian of the Tippecanoe County Public Library, said GrantSelect strengthens the county's online resources and the libraries' mission to meet the informational needs of the public.
 "The Tippecanoe County Public Library has several databases that enable the public to view and research the content of our online resources, including articles, literature, reference materials, and science and education," he said.
 "The GrantSelect database extends our ability to help our almost 67,000 visitors each quarter find the best sources of funding for their personal and professional projects.
" Nick Schenkel, director of the West Lafayette Public Library, said GrantSelect will encourage additional cooperation among Greater Lafayette organizations as they search for and apply for grants.
 "There is already a lot of cooperation among organizations in Tippecanoe County, but GrantSelect will encourage those connections even more," he said.
 "I'm also impressed by how GrantSelect is very intuitive and easy to work. A person can find great results upon their first use.
" Schoolhouse Partners is a full-service consulting firm that provides assistance to educational, nonprofit and community agencies in obtaining grant funding.
 Since 2003 the company has helped nonprofit and tax-exempt groups raise millions of dollars through hundreds of funded grants and awards.
 The mission of The Community Foundation of Greater Lafayette is to inspire, nurture, and practice philanthropy, stewardship, and leadership in the communities we serve.
 United Way will add value to the Greater Lafayette community by enabling people to help one another. It will provide leadership in defining community needs and in coordinating resources to address community issues.

 Green weeds complicate early corn, soybean harvest
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Fields with actively growing weeds from this summer's drought and recent rains could create problems for farmers during harvest, a Purdue Extension weed scientist says.
 The rain, along with early spring-planted crops and the drought have led to fields that contain green weeds along with mature corn and soybean crops.
 "It's a statewide issue," Bill Johnson said. "Wherever we've gotten rain in the past few weeks we're seeing weeds pop up." Late-summer droughts or killing frost usually dry out the ground so new, green weed growth isn't a problem for farmers.
 But this year crops are maturing earlier than normal and a killing frost is still weeks away. Johnson recommended that farmers use herbicides to get rid of weeds and dry out the ground to prevent future weed growth so they can have a timely harvest.
 But, he said, not many herbicides can be used soon before harvest. "Herbicide application isn't mandatory, but it's good practice.
 If the weed growth is bad enough, it could create more wear and tear on machinery and hurt grain quality when harvesting crops," Johnson said.
 Harvest equipment is designed to gather mature crops, not green growth. Green weeds going through combines and other harvesting equipment can cause the machinery to break down and delay harvest.
 Many fields, especially those with soybeans, are maturing unevenly in face of the extensive drought and will make harvest-aid herbicide applications and harvest in general a challenge this fall.
 In a year where crop yields and grain quality are already expected to be low, producers don't need extra problems like weeds messing with their harvests.
 According to Johnson, weeds that are actively popping up in fields across Indiana include morning glories, velvetleaf, foxtail, winter annuals and cover crops that are already starting to regerminate.
 When applying herbicides to eradicate weeds, Johnson reminds producers that most harvest aid products are contact herbicides and selection of spray volumes and nozzles is crucial to adequate coverage.
 "Choose nozzles that allow for smaller droplets to penetrate the canopy and cover vegetation but are also large enough to avoid drift issues," he said.
 Most labels recommend at least 10 gallons per acre for ground applications and a minimum of 5 gallons per acre for aerial applications.
 Johnson and Travis Legleiter, a weed science program specialist, advise producers to check the herbicide label for proper application techniques prior to use.
 They've prepared a table outlining products that can be used as harvest aids in corn and soybeans, which can be found online at

 Harley riders climb aboard to help children with autism
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – About 400 Harley-Davidson riders are expected to participate in the third annual Jerry & Annie Charity Ride on Saturday (June 23) to raise funds for the Cornerstone Autism Foundation to purchase iPads for children with autism.
 The riders will travel 88 miles around mid-north Indiana starting late morning at the Cornerstone Autism Center in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette, located at 3482 McClure Ave.
, and end early evening at Eagle Harley-Davidson at 702 Navco Drive, Lafayette. The ride's route includes Pine Village on state Route 55, U.S.
 Route 41, state Route 28 to Williamsport and Attica, and back to Lafayette. The ride is sponsored by Mid-North Indiana Harley Owner Group Lafayette Chapter 1188 and Eagle Harley-Davidson.
 "We have held charity rides since 1990 to raise money for various important causes such as MS, the Community Cancer Network or Wounded Warrior Project," said Kathe Bell, owner of Eagle Harley-Davidson.
 "When we heard about how an iPad can help a child with autism, we decided to donate this year's funds to this effort." "We've known for quite a few years that computers and other technologies can help children with autism communicate better, but an iPad helps many of them improve their communication skills in leaps and bounds," said David Ide, co-founder and CEO of Cornerstone Autism Center and Cornerstone Autism Foundation.
 "We already have iPads for children enrolled in our centers, and we plan to donate the iPads to the Bauer Family Resources in Lafayette and the Greater Lafayette Area Special Services to be given to children diagnosed with autism and who can benefit from using an iPad.
" Natalee Mace, an Indianapolis mother whose 3-year-old son, Landon, and 4-year-old son, Noah, have both been diagnosed with autism, said using iPads has changed the way her sons communicate.
 "I call them 'magical devices' because they enabled my 3-year-old nonverbal son to communicate with me for the first time," said Mace, who is working as a marketing and fundraising consultant for Cornerstone Autism Foundation.
 "When I put an iPad in front of Landon, he used his index finger to move objects on the screen and was matching letters to spell words.
 It was amazing. It had unlocked his brain and allowed me to enter his world for a few minutes. I want to get iPads in the hands of other children with special needs because I can see how much it helps.
 The Harley ride is a wonderful program that will help many children and their families." The Cornerstone Autism Foundation provides funding for programs and events that serve and benefit children living with an autism spectrum disorder.
 According to the foundation, autism is the fastest-growing disability in the United States, where about one in 88 people are diagnosed with autism.

 Heat, lack of rain exaggerate need for grazing management
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Heat and dry conditions are limiting forage supplies and emphasizing the need for livestock producers to plan and carefully manage their grazing strategies, a Purdue Extension beef specialist says.
 If weather conditions remain dry throughout the remainder of spring and summer, pasture conditions could deteriorate and forages could be in short supply - a situation livestock producers need to plan for.
 One way producers can be proactive is by caring for pastures through rotational grazing, Ron Lemenager said. With rotational grazing, herds are moved from one section of pasture to another to maximize quality and quantity of forage growth.
 Doing so helps prevent overgrazing. "I think most of us realize that if cows are continuous grazing, they are going to always go for the lush, young plant, and that continuous grazing will reduce root growth and root reserves of that plant, and the regrowth is going to be significantly retarded," Lemenager said.
 "Rotational grazing gives these plants an opportunity to rest and grow again. But obviously, rain is going to play a big role in that.
" Without rain to rejuvenate pastures, livestock producers will have to look for other forage options, such as hay. But the dry weather also is limiting hay supplies.
 Lemenager said that producers can limit hay feeding access time to eight hours per day to significantly reduce waste and still provide all the dry matter that the cow can consume in a 24 hour period.
 From his research, total daily hay disappearance will be reduced by 15-20 percent. He said cows and calves are most at risk from low-quality and low-quantity forages.
 One of the first animal performance parameters affected is calf growth. Without proper nutrition, cow milk production will decrease, ultimately affecting weaning weights.
 "When the nutrient supply becomes limiting for these cows, not only will milk production go down, but reproductive performance will also go down," Lemenager said.
 "These are things we have to be most concerned about in our management strategies, and how we think through this challenge is going to be important.
" In addition to rotational grazing and limiting hay access, Lemenager said in the short term producers can consider creep feeding calves.
 But if the dry conditions persist, a longer term strategy would be to consider early weaning. Early-wean rations that contain feeds such as corn, oats, soybean hulls, corn gluten feed or dry distillers grains can be formulated to create cost effective gains.
 Early weaning lowers the cow's nutrient requirements, reduces forage intake of the cow, reduces trampling losses caused by the calves, and can take significant pressure off stressed pastures.
 He also said now might be a good time to consider culling and selling cows that were scheduled for the market later in the year.
 "Cattle prices are strong right now, so it's a good time for producers to consider early marketing," Lemenager said. "They can either wean calves early, or they can sell cow-calf pairs.
" He said prices are seasonally stronger than what they will be in the fall because fewer cattle are going to market at this time.
 More information about managing pastures can be found in Purdue Extension’s free publication, "Management-Intensive Grazing in Indiana.

 Heat advisory includes Purdue campus, surrounding counties; fireworks ban also in place
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University health and safety officials are urging employees and visitors to campus to use caution over the next few days as Tippecanoe and surrounding counties will be under a heat advisory.
 “Due to the drought conditions and extreme heat, it’s simply not safe to shoot off fireworks or start an open fire as the dry conditions could lead to a large fire with the slightest of sparks,” said Carol Shelby, senior director of environmental health and public safety.
 The National Weather Service in Indianapolis issued the advisory as temperatures are expected to exceed 100 degrees both days, with a potential high of 105 degrees on Thursday (June 28).
 "We recommend people stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, specifically water, and stay indoors as much as possible," said Shelby, senior director of environmental health and public safety.
 "If you work outdoors or in a non-air-conditioned area you should arrange with your supervisor to take more frequent breaks to avoid becoming overheated.
" The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) urges people to limit their time outdoors during extreme heat, while wearing lightweight, light colored clothing.
 OHSA recommends people know the signs of heat stress and heat stroke, in order to best prevent health problems. Symptoms of heat stress includes a headache, dizziness, or fainting; weakness and wet skin; irritability or confusion; and thirst, nausea, or vomiting.
 Signs a heat stroke may be occurring are the inability to think clearly, seizures and sweat no longer being produced. According to the National Weather Service, humidity levels will be relatively low, keeping heat indexes close to the air temperature for much of the next two days.

 Heat and drought lead to ear rot potential in corn grain, silage
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Heat and drought in the Corn Belt have created the perfect conditions for Aspergillus ear rot to develop in corn grain and silage - something Purdue Extension plant pathologists say grain and livestock producers need to prepare for.
 The disease is caused by a fungus that produces aflatoxin, a toxic carcinogen for livestock that consumes contaminated grain or silage.
 Aspergillus ear rot normally shows up near the end of the corn growing season as the crop reaches the dent phase. Growers can identify the disease by peeling back the husks and looking for stunted ears with an olive-green dusty mold.
 "This year presents a unique challenge for producers since corn may be cut for silage, and many fields have poorly pollinated plants and limited kernel set," Kiersten Wise said.
 "Growers have asked questions about assessing the potential for Aspergillus ear rot and aflatoxin to occur in these fields." The fungus that causes ear rot needs kernels on an ear to develop.
 Without ears or kernels, Aspergillus ear rot and aflatoxin won't be a problem. If ears with kernels are present in a field, Wise said, it's important to determine if aflatoxin is present.
 Both corn silage and grain can be submitted for analysis by a professional laboratory, such as Purdue's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory
. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has set thresholds for the amount of aflatoxin tolerated in grain, depending on the end use.
 According to Charles Woloshuk, those restrictions are especially tight for the dairy industry. "Aflatoxins are of concern to dairy producers in particular because the Federal Drug Administration regulations require aflatoxin residues in milk to be less than 0.5 parts per billion," he said.
 "To prevent the carryover of aflatoxins into milk, silage and other feed components should not contain greater than 20 parts per billion.
" The bad news for both grain and livestock producers is that at this point in the season there is little they can do to manage Aspergillus
 ear rot or aflatoxin. The best they can do now, according to Wise, is scout prior to harvest and determine if there is a problem and, if so, its severity.
 "If any Aspergillus ear rot is observed in a field, affected areas should be harvested early and grain segregated to avoid aflatoxin contamination of non-infected grain," she said.
 "Grain harvested with suspected Aspergillus ear rot should be dried to below 15 percent moisture." Aflatoxin can continue to accumulate in grain or silage with kernels kept above 15 percent moisture.
 "All grain contaminated by ear rot fungus should be stored separately from good grain and stored below 13 percent moisture to prevent further growth of fungi," Wise said.
 More information about this disease is available in a free Purdue Extension publication, "Diseases of Corn: Aspergillus Ear Rot," available at

 High-tech Indiana company to develop device for use in International Space Station lab
 NEW ALBANY, Ind. - A company based at the Purdue Research Park of Southeast Indiana has signed a contract to develop a device that could be used by astronauts and researchers in the International Space Station National Laboratory.
 Techshot Inc. has earned a contract worth approximately $750,000 from NASA to develop the Analytical Containment Transfer Tool (ACT
2), which will facilitate the safe transfer of chemical and biological material from sample processing equipment to analytical devices while in space.
 The contract follows a $100,000 agreement for the preliminary design work done on ACT2. John Vellinger, COO of Techshot, said the amount of research being conducted at the International Space Station is expected to increase dramatically now that construction has been completed.
 "There is a real need for tools such as ours that can help get samples analyzed while still in space rather than after they've been returned to Earth," Vellinger said.
 "To date, most research payloads have been completely sealed because spilling even a single drop of what is inside could be hazardous to the crew.
 But ACT2 is being designed with multiple redundant containment features, which ensure that astronauts can use it to safely extract samples from one part of the space laboratory and process them in another.
" Vellinger said ACT2 also will have applications for laboratories and clinics on Earth that work with infectious diseases or other materials requiring multiple levels of containment.
 Founded in 1988, Techshot is a new product development company. Besides NASA, its customers include Procter & Gamble, MobileMedTek, Prosolia, Mavizon Technologies and FAST Diagnostics.
 Techshot provides product development solutions to the consumer products, medical, green tech, automotive, aerospace and defense industries.
 The Purdue Research Park has the largest university-affiliated business incubation program in the country. The park's four Indiana sites are in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.
 The nearly 200 companies located in the park network employ about 4,000 people.

 Home lawn during drought: To water ... or not?
 Purdue University turf grass specialist Aaron Patton inspects a lawn that is partially green and partially brown, showing signs of drought stress.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Many homeowners wonder whether they should regularly water their dry lawns during a drought or essentially leave them alone.
 A Purdue Extension turfgrass specialist says each option has its pros and cons. During a dry season, many lawns will show initial symptoms of drought stress
, Aaron Patton said. As grass loses water, its leaves become less rigid and wilt; in this stage, grass stays flat after it is stepped on rather than "bouncing back.
" The most telltale signs of drought stress, however, are the crunchy tan or brown leaves of grass that has entered dormancy; the plant is still alive, but the leaves dry up and die.
 This helps the plant conserve water and survive a drought. Drought stress is most noticeable on slopes and lawns established on shallow or poor soil, Patton said.
 "In order to keep your lawn green during hot and dry periods, at least 1 inch of water will need to be applied weekly," Patton said.
 "However, you can keep your lawn alive with far less water." Homeowners can water regularly enough to avoid drought stress altogether, or they can let their lawn go dormant and water only occasionally to help it survive.
 "Water turf two to three times weekly - deeply, a good soaking, so you don't have to water daily," Patton said. Watering in the early-morning hours is most effective; watering in the evening could encourage disease or pests.
 * Advantages: Turf will stay green, aesthetically pleasing and actively growing; ground remains soft so it can be used for recreation; deep soaking will foster deep roots, which will help plants better survive a prolonged drought.
 * Disadvantages: Higher water bill for those with city water; some increased risk of turf disease. "Once the lawn turns brown and goes dormant, we can't tell if a lawn is dying unless we water and wait to see the response," Patton said.
 "That is why we advise to water once every two weeks with one-half inch of water once the turf goes dormant to keep plant crowns hydrated during drought.
 This amount of water will not green up the turf, but it will increase long-term survival during long dry spells." * Advantages: Avoid irrigation costs; most turf species are drought-tolerant and will survive typical Indiana droughts.
 * Disadvantages: Difficult to tell when turf is getting too dry and needs water to stay alive; lawn is brown and has poor aesthetics; hard soil makes turf less usable for recreation; turf is more susceptible to injury and will not recover until rain returns; some thinning and turf death can occur if there is no rain for 4-6 weeks and no irrigation is applied.
 Patton emphasized that when lawns are dry, it is important to stay off them. Mowers and other heavy equipment can cause substantial damage to vulnerable, stressed grass.
 Once rains return, the turf will begin to recover and grow new leaves within two weeks. For more information about keeping lawns healthy during the drought, visit

 Horse owners should watch for symptoms of equine disease
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Horse owners and equine-housing facilities should be on the lookout for symptoms of Potomac Horse Fever, a bacterial disease that can lead to serious health conditions or death, a Purdue University specialist says.
 A horse admitted to the College of Veterinary Medicine Large Animal Hospital in mid-June has been diagnosed with the disease. Cases of Potomac Horse Fever usually don't show up in Indiana until July or August.
 "This early case could mean that the mild winter and spring will lead to more cases of the disease this summer," said Janice E. Kritchevsky, professor of large animal internal medicine.
 Most insect populations are running about three weeks early, said Tom Turpin, Purdue Extension entomologist. "It doesn't surprise me that a disease with an insect vector, or immediate host, is showing up early as well," he said.
 Freshwater snails, caddisflies, mayflies, stoneflies, damselflies and dragonflies are common carriers for Neorickettsia risticcii
, the bacterium responsible for Potomac Horse Fever. The insects are attracted by nightlights at barn lots, stables and show arenas and to water troughs at these locations.
 When they die, they litter the ground or fall onto feedstuffs or into water. Horses contract the disease by eating contaminated hay, grain, or pasture or drinking contaminated water.
 Potomac Horse Fever is not contagious. If more than one horse at the same location contracts the disease, it is because of the environmental conditions that draw the vectors.
 The disease causes colitis, dehydration and diarrhea. Without treatment, which includes tetracycline-based antibiotics, intravenous fluids and anti-inflammatory agents, the disease can lead to shock, permanent lameness or even death.
 During the first few days, a horse "just looks off," Kritchevsky said. Affected horses usually stop eating, become lethargic and develop a high fever.
 Then they may develop watery diarrhea and become dehydrated. In severe cases, horses may founder or develop laminitis. The disease may also cause abortion in pregnant mares.
 "Horses need to be diagnosed quickly," Kritchevsky said. "Early treatment increases the likelihood of survival." Purdue's Large Animal Hospital treats horses with Potomac Horse Fever every year.
 When complications such as founder have occurred, horses have had to be euthanized. The horse admitted to the hospital in June recovered and has been discharged.
 * Vaccination. This protects against only one strain of the more than 60 identified strains of N. risticii. But a study by Purdue's Sandra Taylor, a researcher in equine infectious diseases, identified factors that might predict survival.
 Vaccination did not increase the odds of survival, but it may decrease the severity of the disease. * Watch for symptoms. Call your veterinarian if a horse is off its feed, has a fever or develops diarrhea.
 Unless there is another explanation for the sickness, consider Potomac Horse Fever as a potential cause. * Keep all feedstuffs clean and covered.
 Many of the insects that carry the bacteria die soon after hatching. Their carcasses can fall into open grain bins and onto hay.
 Cover stored hay with tarps, and make sure grain bins are secured. Keep water buckets and troughs clean and free of debris and dead insects.
 * Do not attract flying insects. Large floodlights can provide security at night, but they also attract many flying insects. Consider turning off outside lights during summer months.
 The veterinarians in Purdue's Large Animal Internal Medicine Department are specialists in Potomac Horse Fever and other equine infectious diseases.
 Horse owners or veterinarians who have questions can call the hospital at 765-494-8548.

 Hurt: Corn yield projections down, but not as much as expected
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Corn and soybean yield projections decreased Wednesday (Sept. 12) as the nation's Corn Belt continues to suffer through the worst drought since at least 1956.
 According to a U.S. Department of Agriculture Crop Production report, the nation's corn crop could be just 10.7 billion bushels, down less than 1 percent from the Aug.
 10 report and 13 percent from 2011. Those numbers represent the smallest corn crop since 2006. While the corn yield projections declined, Purdue Extension agricultural economist Chris Hurt said they didn't drop as much as expected compared with the August report.
 "The surprise was on the corn market. Corn yields were not dropped very much – about six-tenths of a bushel per acre," Hurt said.
 "What we saw is that in the primary Midwest, especially Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, the yields all came down some. But in the southern tier of states, we actually saw an increase in yields, so we kind of had an offset.
" Soybean production was forecast at 2.63 billion bushels, down 2 percent since August and 14 percent from 2011. The projections are slightly less than what Hurt said markets anticipated.
 Indiana's corn and soybean yield projections held steady from August to September. The USDA anticipated 605 million bushels of corn, down 28 percent from 2011.
 Indiana soybeans were projected at 184.6 million bushels, down 22 percent from 2011. Wednesday corn markets were bearish on the heels of the release of the USDA report, but soybean futures prices jumped.
 Cash corn prices for new crop ranged from $7.75 to $8 per bushel, while new crop-cash soybean prices averaged between $17 and $17.50 in Indiana.
 "As we think about marketing, there certainly are some differences between corn and soybeans," he said. "For corn, current bids into the storage season are relatively flat going across the fall and into the spring, without substantial increases or decreases.
 What that tells us is that storing corn still makes some sense if one believes corn prices can still rally and that there is limited concern about a major drop in prices.
 "Soybeans are different because of the very large South American production. If they have a reasonable growing season, we're going to start seeing lower soybean prices by maybe January and especially February and March.
" The strong cash and futures prices will help some grain producers offset drought-induced harvest losses. October grain prices also will influence the amount some insured producers will receive in indemnity payments.
 But the reduced yields and high prices do little to help the negative profit margins of livestock producers struggling to feed their herds.
 "The livestock industry gets just a tiny bit of reprieve in the sense that corn isn't as desperately short as I think many people thought going into this report," Hurt said.
 "On the other hand, corn prices aren't going to fade substantially. It's going to be very difficult for the livestock industry to just hold on as cash flows are probably going to be negative for the most part.
" Purdue Extension agricultural economist Corinne Alexander will offer additional analysis of the report and a 2013 Agricultural Outlook during a free webinar at 8:30 a.m.
 EDT Thursday (Sept. 13) at https://gomeet.itap.purdue.edu/outlook/. The webinar also will be recorded and archived at http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/extension/programs/lunch.asp

 Increased use of alternative-fuel vehicles lowers 2011 gasoline consumption levels in northern Indiana
 Increased use of alternative-fuel vehicles lowers 2011 gasoline consumption levels in northern Indiana MERRILLVILLE, Ind. - There were fewer greenhouse gases emitted and less gasoline consumed in northern Indiana counties in 2011 as municipal and corporate entities were encouraged by a nonprofit organization to incorporate alternative-fuel vehicles in their fleets.
 According to South Shore Clean Cities Inc., northern Indiana government agencies, municipalities, companies and nonprofit administrations across 18 counties reduced gasoline consumption by 11,167,705 gallons and greenhouse gas emissions by 87,123 tons during 2011.
 The information is listed in South Shore Clean Cities' 2011 Annual Report to the U.S. Department of Energy. South Shore Clean Cities stakeholders operate in the Indiana counties of Benton, DeKalb, Elkhart, Fulton, Jasper, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Lake, LaPorte, Marshall, Newton, Noble, Porter, Pulaski, St.
 Joseph, Starke, Steuben and Whitley. They include municipalities like Elkhart, South Bend and Valparaiso; nonprofit organizations like the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission; and businesses like ArcelorMittal, Schwan's Home Services, Tube City and U.S.
 Steel. Carl Lisek, executive director of South Shore Clean Cities, said alternative-fuel vehicles were the single greatest factor behind the levels of reduced consumption and emissions.
 "We can link the use of alternative-energy vehicles with 98 percent of the reduction in gasoline consumption and 97 percent of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions," he said.
 "These vehicles are powered by fuels like biodiesel, compressed natural gas, electricity, ethanol and liquefied petroleum gas." 
Lisek, who also is co-founder of Purdue Research Park-based Legacy Environmental Services, said 2011 was a strong year for South Shore Clean Cities for outreach activities across northern Indiana and receiving grants from local, state and federal sources.
 "Representatives of South Shore Clean Cities attended more than 70 events across the state in 2011," he said. "We expanded our reach by creating a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to share information about our events, our members and alternative-fuel information.
 "We secured $12,566,281 in funds from 16 grants and contracts in 2011. Grants and contracts included the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S.
 Department of Transportation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Indiana Office of Energy Development and the U.S.
 Soybean Board." Lisek explained how the general public may benefit as northern Indiana agencies, municipalities and companies continue to reduce their gasoline consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
 "When the nation can reduce its dependence on imported petroleum, our quality of life improves as our economic and energy security is strengthened," he said.
 "As our environment becomes cleaner, people's health and livelihoods may also improve. South Shore Clean Cities and our stakeholders are determined to continue this trend for the long term.
" Designated as the 71st Clean Cities Coalition on June 15, 1999, South Shore Clean Cities Inc. was founded on the principle that motivated individuals working together for common goals best accomplish our nation's objectives.
 In almost 100 coalitions, government agencies and private companies voluntarily form partnerships that meet the objectives of improving air quality, developing regional economic opportunities and reducing the use of imported oil.
 The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The park network is home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.

 India needs system reforms in education, infrastructure, culture to grow innovation and commercialization efforts
 India needs system reforms in education, infrastructure, culture to grow innovation and commercialization efforts WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.
 - India remains one of the world's fastest growing economies. But cultural, educational, infrastructure and leadership challenges are inhibiting growth of its innovation and commercialization efforts, a new study by a Purdue University professor shows.
 Pankaj Sharma, a Purdue professor with a courtesy appointment in technology leadership and innovation and a native of India who moved to the United States in 1982, said India needs
systems-driven reforms to promote growth and innovation and sustain the economic growth it has achieved in recent decades. His study, titled "India's National and Regional Innovation Systems: Challenges, Opportunities and Recommendations for Policy Makers," has been published this month in the 
Journal of Industry and Innovation. The study was done in conjunction with Sharma's appointment as a U.S. State Department Fulbright New Century Scholar.
 "There is a need for necessary reforms to affect major change in the innovation system of India, but there are both social and cultural barriers, such as limited teamwork education and the enduring importance of upward hierarchical progression," among other obstacles, Sharma said.
 "A lack of confidence in innovation capabilities is coupled with a failure to positively reinforce innovation efforts and a strong need for control, which gets in the way of cooperation with other organizations.
" A key challenge facing Indian universities, research institutions and corporations is an educational system established during the pre-liberalization era that emphasizes learning through memorization rather than factual understanding, teamwork and creative thinking.
 "The lack of quality education has churned out a workforce with inefficient and inadequate skills, rendering the industry-academia linkage relatively weak over time," said Sharma, who also serves as managing director of Purdue's Global Sustainability Institute in 
Discovery Park. Researchers in India also seem more motivated by publication of their research, not patenting and commercialization that could advance the impact of their efforts, he said.
 Sharma says India faces a shortage, and even an absence in some cases, of the necessary support mechanisms that foster commercialization and innovation - research funds, venture capital funds, and start-up capital, as well as awareness programs and initiatives.
 "A lack of these support systems has resulted in a limited number of innovative ideas, relatively few motivated individuals, and subsequently, very few or minimal incentives for people to generate innovative ideas," he said.
 Since its independence from Great Britain in 1947, India's economy has surged by more than 200 times its per capita annual income, led by increases in the size of a middle-class consumer, a relatively young labor force, the manufacturing sector and considerable foreign investments.
 India's economy ranks as the 11th largest in the world and is the third largest based on purchasing power. Despite those enviable statistics and an economy ranking among the world's leaders in the mid-2000s, Indian corporations still face major infrastructure, leadership and cultural challenges.
 To address those, Sharma says Indian companies must focus on local needs by improving basic civil infrastructure such as transportation, sanitation and water, health-care and energy systems.
 Nearly 400 million people in India, for example, lack access to electricity. India spends less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care.
 For its educational and research institutions, India must scale up its entrepreneurial courses and programs and focus on research and technology development relevant to India's infrastructure needs - water purification, energy, pharmaceuticals and pesticides for crops, for example.
 He encouraged Indian institutions to reach out to foreign universities to bolster their technology commercialization efforts and heighten collaboration with industry to transfer knowledge as technology.
 Moreover, the nation can provide networking opportunities and offer funding incentives that encourage researchers to start companies.
 "Most people in Indian society are risk-averse. Failure is neither tolerated nor accepted by such people," Sharma said. "This lack of tolerance toward failure instills the fear of taking risks ...
 thus making it difficult for them to generate innovative ideas or to promote existing ones." Eight regional clusters of business incubators, educational/research institutions and corporations have been identified.
 The Mumbai and Pune clusters accounted for the largest number of patent applications followed by the Bangalore and Delhi clusters.
 A policy recommendation is to foster local interaction among these actors to exploit synergy to promote innovation and regional economic development.
 Ian P. McCarthy, the Canada Research Chair in Technology & Operations Management and director of the CMA Innovation Centre at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, said the work by Sharma provides insights on how the growth of clusters, and associated industries, contributes to the recent economic growth and development within a number of regions across India.
 "Research on the interplay between innovation systems and economic development is regarded as being important to national and regional competiveness.
 Yet, there is a dearth of research on how these mechanisms function in the India," McCarthy said. Miranda Schreurs, director of the Environmental Policy Research Centre at Germany's Freie University in Berlin, pointed out that Sharma and his co-authors surveyed more than 30 business incubators, funding agencies and research institutions, determining what stimulates innovation and what obstructs it.
 They identify locations in India that generate many patents, an indication of innovation. "Governments, Professor Sharma argues, could stimulate greater innovation by investing in the development of science and technology entrepreneurial parks and technology business incubators that place scientists and researchers in close proximity with business entrepreneurs," she said.
 "Although he focuses his attention on the Indian context, much of what he argues applies to other countries as well." Note To Journalists

pfiorini@purdue.edu, 765-496-3133. India's National and Regional Innovation Systems: Challenges, Opportunities and Recommendations for Policy Makers
 There is a need for continuous reforms in India's infrastructure, innovation culture, and dynamic leadership to sustain the growth of innovation.
 The purpose of this empirical study is to gain a better understanding of India's innovation systems. A comprehensive analysis on two levels has been done on both a national level and a regional level.
 First, the section about the national level explores and explains the challenges and opportunities of India's innovation capacity using a semi-structured questionnaire of the practitioners.
 Second, the section about the regional level discusses the clusters formed within India through a mapping of industrial firms, educational/research institutions, and innovation parks.
 Both an empirical activity framework and a functional-based conceptual framework have been presented to highlight the themes of "building-upgrading-promoting" and "democracy-culture-infrastructure.
" Finally, this paper makes a theoretical contribution by providing a conceptual framework for studying India's Innovation System and giving recommendations to policy makers about sustaining the innovation.

 Indiana company provides health and identity cards for 3 U.S. Olympic teams
 MERRILLVILLE, Ind. – Three U.S. Olympic teams at the 2012 Olympics in London will use a technology of a Purdue Research Park-based company in Northwest Indiana that produces an identity card to link to an individual's medical history.
 I-DENTI-FIED Inc.'s patent-pending health-care identifier system is being used by the U.S. athletes with the national diving team, synchronized swimming and tumbling gymnastics.
 The technology is a personal health record of the individual that can be accessed using a secure ID through a secure online network in the event of injury or illness.
 The identifier, which unlocks the health history of an individual, is provided on a driver's license-type card, bracelet, keychain or any item that can support a bar code, QR code or RFID transponder.
 Information accessed using the cards or other personal items with an individualized bar code can only be opened by using proprietary software through a secure network.
 "The availability of such information not only ensures positive identification, but is vital in emergencies where immediate physical intervention is needed by first-responders or health-care professionals and where knowledge of a person's health history such as clinical conditions, allergies or current medications can expedite emergency care," said Steve Wise, president and CEO of I-DENTI-FIED.
 "It is not uncommon for people to see multiple physicians, specialists and other health-care professionals, and even with the best intentions medical practitioners may act with little or no knowledge of the clinical history, medications, recent test findings or the personal preferences of the patients they treat.
 The system provides a longitudinal health profile of individuals." In addition, the medical information found through the identifier system contains medical procedures, emergency contacts, insurance coverage and other useful information.
 Wise said another advantage to the identifier system is that it may reduce medical errors, waste and readmissions. Wise and Kevin Brunski, I-DENTI-FIED founder and chief medical officer, worked with Ralph Reiff, executive director of St.
 Vincent Sports Performance, and Terry Robinson, PT, ATC, head athletic trainer of U.S. Diving, to integrate a flexible health and information management system with global portal access.
 "It is a challenge to collect and maintain the health records of the athletes, and information is typically hand-written and can contain outdated data," Robinson said.
 "We wanted a way to streamline our travel preparations and simultaneously provide current identity and health records to event personnel when we are traveling and competing around the globe.
 "With our old method of documenting medical records, we spent many hours verifying and updating about 20 athletes. This system has saved us much time, resources and provides the most up-to-date information.
" The I-DENTI-FIED technology was previously used by the U.S. Diving Team in a multi-national event in China in 2011. The identifier system also has been adopted by the Indiana Department of Homeland Security and is being introduced as a critical component to Accountable Care Organizations in Indianapolis and Nashville Tenn.
 I-DENTI-FIED Inc. develops, produces, and markets affordable patient identification products and related programs that connect patients to their own personal health records (PHRs), by providing access to these records by emergency and non-emergency caregivers and service providers during a patient encounter.
 The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The parks are home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Merrillville, Indianapolis and New Albany.

 Indiana sees more drought relief, but dry conditions persist
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Remnants from Hurricane Isaac significantly improved Indiana's drought status, but the state is not out of the woods quite yet.
 The U.S. Drought Monitor (www.droughtmonitor.unl.edu) released Thursday morning showed that none of the state remains in extreme or exceptional drought - the two most extreme levels.
 Last week more than 25 percent of the state was in extreme drought and more than 10 percent was in exceptional drought. "Isaac moved northward so slowly.
 By the time it reached Indiana it had weakened considerably and didn't give us the extreme rainfall that was originally forecast, but it did us some good," said Ken Scheeringa, associate state climatologist based at Purdue University.
 "We've definitely seen a more consistent rainfall pattern in recent weeks. You can tell that just by looking at your lawn. Lawn mowers have been busy.
 Scheeringa said some parts of northeastern Indiana saw only about a half inch of rain from the leftovers of Isaac, which came ashore in and around Louisiana last week.
 Southwestern Indiana received as much as 4.5 inches. Overall, most of the state saw 2 to 2.5 inches. Next week's temperatures are expected to be closer to seasonal norms, but forecasts show drier-than-normal conditions likely.
 The U.S. Drought monitor shows almost the entire southern half of Indiana in severe drought, while the northern portion continues in moderate drought or abnormally dry conditions.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Hot, dry conditions are actually causing a glut of Indiana sweet corn from irrigated farms, but Hoosiers could see less of the summertime favorite over the long term, says a Purdue University expert.
 Liz Maynard, a Purdue Extension horticulture specialist, said growers with irrigation may have an abundance of sweet corn now because the high temperatures cause sweet corn to mature faster.
 Plantings that would normally take another week or so to mature are ready now. Over the entire season, however, consumers may see a decrease in the amount of Indiana corn available.
 "Growers who have irrigation are able to have a crop. The folks who don't have irrigation probably will have some serious yield loss," Maynard said.
 "Even those with irrigation could have trouble because the temperatures have been so hot and there has been so little rain that irrigation may not be enough.
 Sweet corn that doesn't get enough water may have lower yields or ears that don't completely fill in with kernels." It's unclear how the supply of sweet corn will affect prices at farm stands throughout the state.
 Maynard said weather conditions, competition, pricing strategies and costs for growers and farm marketers are varied. "Some growers may keep prices stable, others may decide to recoup higher irrigation costs with a slight price increase and others may decide to reduce prices if there is a temporary oversupply," Maynard said.
 "What matters most to the consumer is probably the price and quality at their favorite farm stands or markets, and I can't predict that.
 The best way to find out is to contact the farm market." More information about the drought is available at Purdue Extension's website

 Initiative offers path for students to graduate in 4 years
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – As a new class of students settles in for the academic year on the Purdue University campus, a new initiative is in place to help them earn a bachelor's degree in four years.
 4-3-2-1-Graduate! is an initiative developed through the Indiana Commission for Higher Education that is being modified and promoted at Purdue.
 The initiative's four pillars include: "It really stuck with me because of its simplicity," said Dale Whittaker, Purdue's vice provost for undergraduate academic affairs.
 "The primary area I think about within my responsibilities is that every student that comes here can get a degree in a field they want in a timely manner.
" Whittaker said the goal is to have 50 percent of the Class of 2016 graduate in four years. Recent statistics show 42 percent of students graduate in four years.
 Whittaker said students who fulfill the four pillars of 4-3-2-1-Graduate! tend to perform better academically. "We were trying to think of how we could increase four-year graduation numbers," said Purdue Student Government President Joe Rust.
 "This is going to be one of our tools used to increase that rate." 4-3-2-1-Graduate! was developed by the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.
 Purdue biomedical engineering major Keith Hansen served as a student ambassador for the Indiana Commission for Higher Education to help promote the need for student success and timely completion, which also plays into 4-3-2-1-Graduate!
 "What you're seeing now is a wholesale launch so that every student will understand it as a recipe for success," Whittaker said.
 "It's your goal and the steps you have to take to reach that graduation date and to do it in four years," Rust added. Through dozens of interviews, Rust is working to create a video that will inform students of programs and services available on campus.
 "We want to show that not only are there programs and services on campus that will help them graduate in four years, but we also have so many committed staff, faculty and administrators that really want them to graduate in four years," Rust said.
 "They're here to help, and we want students to know they can go into their offices and ask for help in the areas that they work in.
" Rust highlighted the various tutor, supplemental information and undergraduate studies programs as some of the many services available.
 "Students who are more involved on campus tend to be more academically successful," he said. "Students who study more tend to have a higher GPA, and that's an indicator they are successful in the classroom.
 It all ties together to the idea of graduating in four years." Promoting the need for students to make one leadership commitment goes past the idea of graduating in four years.
 "We want these students in 10 or 15 years to be world changers," Whittaker said. "We only have four short years to build these skills, so this recipe is a simple way to articulate our expectations.
" Purdue has approximately 1,000 student organizations, Rust noted. The goal of having each student making one leadership commitment does not necessarily entail holding a cabinet position within a group.
 "We want students to come up with a leadership commitment, and maybe that's a commitment to yourself, a commitment to the campus or a commitment to academic success," Rust said.
 Cameron Brown and Brett Westcott – better known as the Purdue Compliment Guys – exemplified this idea perfectly, Rust said. The students regularly stood on campus and offered compliments to people walking past.
 "They were not involved with a position and not involved with a specific organization," he said. "But they had a leadership commitment to make the campus a happier place.
 They did what they thought was right and they did what they thought was best."

 Innovation fund awards nearly $200,000 to help commercialize Purdue discoveries 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The Trask Innovation Fund (TIF) awarded nearly $200,000 to Purdue researchers studying alternative fuels, pharmaceutical drug dosage forms, assisted reproductive technology and a mobile app for note-taking in the most recent round of awards through the Trask Innovation Fund.
 The Purdue Research Foundation-managed Trask Innovation Fund is a development program to assist faculty whose discoveries are being commercialized through the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization.
 "The Trask Innovation Fund provides Purdue researchers with funding to assist in the process of commercializing a discovery," said Joseph B.
 Hornett, senior vice president, treasurer and COO of the Purdue Research Foundation. "The awards can be used to prove a concept, develop prototypes, marketing research and advisement, and other necessary resources to help move a discovery into the market.
" Elizabeth Hart-Wells, assistant vice president and director of the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization, said recipients are selected from faculty and staff submissions and is a competitive process.
 "There are many Purdue staff and faculty across many disciplines doing research that has practical applications," Hart-Wells said.
 "We work together to move these important discoveries to a more advanced stage of readiness, increasing their value and improving the chances that they can be realized as products and services that make positive and meaningful impacts in our communities.
" The 10-member Trask Innovation Fund Advisory Council is comprised of representatives from Purdue Research Foundation, Purdue University 
Office of the Vice President for Research, Purdue faculty and the executives from the local business community. "This round of Trask awards was highly competitive, and the decision to fund these particular discoveries depended on several factors.
 including the practical application, the intellectual property strategy, and the commercialization stage of the discoveries," said Richard O.
 Buckius, Purdue's vice president for research and a co-director of the TIF advisory council. "Each year we award about $500,000 through the fund.
" "Termite-Derived Biocatalysts for Use in Sustainable Energy Production," Michael E. Scharf, associate professor and the O.W. Rollins/Orkin Chair of the Department of Entomology, $40,590.
 The research aims to offer sustainable strategies for biofuel production that are compatible with existing agricultural systems in the United States, and, importantly, do not rely on invasive plant species or the development of new cropping systems.
 "Development of Novel Prefabricated Film Based Dosage Forms: Eye on Commercialization," Rodolfo Pinal, associate professor in the Department of Industrial and Physical Pharmacy, $49,999.
 Discovery provides a novel design for prescription drug dosage forms that may help physicians customize drug doses, better control the drug release for particular patients and improve the efficiency of drug manufacturing.
 "Dynamic Imaging for In Vitro Embryo Viability Assessment: A new Assisted Reproductive Technology," David Nolte, professor in the Department of Physics, $48,324.
 The technology provides multiple dimension imaging techniques that measure the health of a fertilized egg and enable assisted-reproductive technicians to guide selection and may increase the chances for successful "in utero" implantation.

 Innovation promises expanded roles for microsensors
 Researchers have learned how to improve the performance of sensors that use tiny vibrating "microcantilevers," like the one pictured here, to detect chemical and biological agents for applications from national security to food processing.
 (Vijay Kumar, Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Researchers have learned how to improve the performance of sensors that use tiny vibrating microcantilevers to detect chemical and biological agents for applications from national security to food processing.
 The microcantilevers - slivers of silicon shaped like small diving boards - vibrate at their natural, or "resonant," frequency. Analyzing the frequency change when a particle lands on the microcantilever reveals the particle's presence and potentially its mass and composition.
 The sensors are now used to research fundamental scientific questions. However, recent advances may allow for reliable sensing with portable devices, opening up a range of potential applications, said 
Jeffrey Rhoads, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University. Creating smaller sensors has been complicated by the fact that measuring the change in frequency does not work as well when the sensors are reduced in size.
 The researchers showed how to sidestep this obstacle by measuring amplitude, or how far the diving board moves, instead of frequency.
 "When you try to shrink these systems, the old way of measuring does not work as well," Rhoads said. "We've made the signal processing part easier, enabling small-scale, lower-power sensors, which are more reliable and have the potential for higher sensitivities.
" Findings are detailed in a paper appearing online this week in the Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems. The paper was written by graduate research assistants Vijay Kumar and J.
 William Boley, undergraduate student Yushi Yang, mechanical engineering professor George Chiu and Rhoads. An earlier paper was published in April in the weekly journal 
Applied Physics Letters. The work is based at the Dynamic Analysis of Micro- and Nanosystems Laboratory at Purdue's Birck Nanotechnology Center.
 The aim is to apply the new approach to build sensors capable of reliably measuring particles that have a mass of less than one picogram - or trillionth of a gram - at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
 The microcantilever sensors have promise in detecting and measuring constituents such as certain proteins or DNA for biological testing in liquids, gases and the air.
 The devices might find applications in breath analyzers, industrial and food processing, national security and defense, and food and water quality monitoring.
 "One question about these sensors is whether they will continue to work in the field," Rhoads said. "We've been doing a lot of blind, false-positive and false-negative tests to see how they perform in a realistic environment.
 We've had only a few false positives and negatives in months of testing." The findings focus on detecting gases and show that the new sensors should be capable of more reliably measuring smaller quantities of gas than is possible with current sensors.
 Measuring amplitude is far easier than measuring frequency because the amplitude changes dramatically when a particle lands on the microcantilever, whereas the change in frequency is minute.
 "We haven't beaten the sensitivity of all other sensors yet," Rhoads said. "But the difference is that we are trying to do it with a compact device that is truly implementable at the microscale, while many others use fairly large laboratory equipment.
" The researchers tested the cantilevers in a chamber filled with precisely controlled quantities of methanol to study their reliability.
 A patent is pending on the invention. The research has been partially funded by the National Science Foundation. Student support was provided by Purdue and the Purdue Research Foundation.
 Note to Journalists: Electronic copies of the research papers are available from the journal or by contacting Emil Venere, Purdue News Service, at 765-494-4709,

 -C. Chiu, Member, IEEE, ASME, Jeffrey F. Rhoads, Member, ASME The potential to detect very small amounts of added mass has driven research in chemical and biological sensors based on resonant micro- and nano-electromechanical systems over the past two decades.
 While traditional resonant mass sensors utilize chemomechanically induced shifts in linear natural frequency for mass detection, alternate sensing approaches, which exploit the near-resonant nonlinear behavior, have garnered interest from the research community due to their potential to yield improved sensor metrics and simplify final device implementations.
 This paper investigates the development of an amplitude-based, mass-sensing approach, which utilizes the dynamic transitions that occur near a saddle-node bifurcation in the nonlinear frequency response of a piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever.
 Specifically, the work details the modeling, analysis and experimental validation of this mass sensing technique. The experimental results presented here not only prove the feasibility of the proposed sensing approach, but also allows for the direct evaluation of pertinent sensor metrics.

 Insecticide restrictions important as soybeans mature
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - An early soybean harvest is fast approaching amid the worst drought in decades, making it that much more important for growers to pay attention to restrictions on use of insecticides as plants near maturity.
 Even though soybean growers still are seeing spider mites and aphid emergence, a Purdue Extension entomologist warned against applying insecticides past the R5, or beginning seed, growth stage.
 "Whether it's due to spider mite damage or in combination with the drought and heat, maybe soybean fields are stressed this season and will likely see an early harvest," Christian Krupke said.
 "Keep in mind that although active spider mite populations, or even bean leaf beetle leaf or pod feeding, might still be found, all insecticides have a preharvest interval that is stated on the label.
" Soybean plants begin to senesce or "shut down" once they reach the R5 growth stage, so insecticide applications are not enhancing yields at that point, Krupke said.
 "We don't have any mite-specific data to go on, but for soybean aphids we have not seen yield benefits when treating at or beyond R5, regardless of pest pressure," he said.
 "There is nothing to be gained by wiping out insects feeding on what is essentially dying foliage - it's not contributing anything to yield at this stage anyway.
" Krupke and Purdue Extension entomologist John Obermeyer put together a table of common soybean insecticides, rate and formulation information and the preharvest application restrictions for the latest issue of the Purdue Pest and Crop Newsletter at

 iPad pharmacy checklist could be prescription for better health

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A quick, interactive survey taken on an iPad could help pharmacists and patients better use their brief time together to catch and eliminate harmful drug side effects.
 Matthew Murawski, a Purdue University associate professor of pharmacy administration, created a new tool that presents patients with a five-question checklist that catches up to 60 percent of all known medication side effects.
 "Many patients do not mention side effects to their doctor or pharmacist because they either don't recognize that they are connected to the medication or they consider them the cost they must pay to keep from being ill or dying," Murawski said.
 "In addition, patients who are experiencing side effects are less likely to take the medication as prescribed or may stop taking the medication altogether, which can lead to catastrophic health consequences.
 Pharmacists can work with patients to eliminate most of these side effects, but they can't help if they don't know what the patient is experiencing.
" Exponential growth in the traffic at pharmacies over the past few decades has slashed the time pharmacists have with each patient to an average of two minutes - one third of what the counseling time was 20 years ago - and a system was needed to help make the discovery of adverse reactions easier and more efficient, he said.
 "With all of the training and education invested in every pharmacist, I honestly believe they are the most underutilized health-care practitioners," Murawski said.
 "This tool makes the few minutes available for counseling much more rewarding. The checklist results allow the pharmacist to immediately see side effects the patient is experiencing and target their time to solving these problems and improving the patient's quality of life.
" Pharmacists may suggest simple changes like taking a medication after meals or avoiding certain foods, or they can work with a patient's physician to change medications or develop a different therapy plan, he said.
 When a patient arrives at a pharmacy they could be handed an iPad with the checklist to fill out while they wait. A list of medications, including both the generic and brand names, is presented on the first screen and the pharmacist selects the medication the patient is taking.
 A patient is then presented with yes-or-no questions that cover the most common and serious side effect symptoms and the degree to which the problems are experienced.
 Once the checklist is complete, the iPad is returned to the pharmacist. The results are displayed as colored bars that show which side effects occurred and which are most problematic.
 After each consultation, the pharmacist resets the checklist before the next patient uses the iPad. Because the patient does not enter any identifying information and the checklist results are not saved, the same iPad can be used by multiple patients without the risk of revealing private information.
 Patients would have the option of allowing their anonymous results to be collected for further research into the incidence of adverse reactions and harmful side effects.
 Murawski's method, named Pharmaceutical Therapy-Related Quality of Life or PTRQoL, began as paper checklists that took up multiple file folders behind a pharmacist's desk.
 Mark Sharp, director of Purdue's Hook Teleproduction Center, helped automate the paper checklist and created the user interface and software that is compatible with iPads and other tablet devices and platforms.
 Side effects from medication use in the general population are not routinely tracked and reported. The results of clinical trials and the federal government's adverse event notification system were the only sources of such information when Murawski began his research two years ago.
 These represent the extremes of the best and worst conditions, he said. "Clinical trials involve ideal conditions in which preselected patients take the drugs exactly according to direction, and the adverse event notification system is used only for really severe problems," Murawski said.
 "These results do not necessarily translate to the reality of use in the general public. I wanted to know the sharp end of the spear - what was actually happening in the pharmacies and with the average person.
" A seed grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. through Purdue's College of Pharmacy funded Murawski's investigation into the side effects being experienced by patients at 10 community pharmacies in Indiana.
 Murawski focused his study on the top 200 most-dispensed drugs in the United States, which account for 90 percent of the volume in pharmacies.
 He sorted these medications by their drug classes and then cataloged all of the potential side effects for each class. From the 2,000 surveys completed at the sites, Murawski found that approximately 50 percent of patients reported experiencing a symptom that could be a drug-related side effect, and pharmacists were able to confirm 20 percent of these were directly tied to medication use.
 He extracted the incidence rates of each side effect and created a new checklist weighted by the severity of the problem and the most common problems experienced.
 Sometimes side-effect symptoms can be a sign of something more serious, including taking an improper dose of the drug, an interaction with another medication or a harmful drug reaction.
 The sooner a pharmacist or physician can detect such problems, the better, Murawski said. In addition to health risks, such problems can be expensive.
 According to a study published in the Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association, the cost associated with managing drug-related problems exceeded $177.4 billion in 2000.
 The costs to people's health and the health-care system from patients not taking a drug as prescribed or discontinuing a medication without consulting a health-care practitioner have not been well documented.
 A study by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research that examined drug compliance for patients suffering from diabetes or osteoporosis found that the rate of hospitalization increased as adherence to a medication regimen dropped and overall medical charges were much higher for those who did not take medication as prescribed.
 "If someone stops taking a drug as prescribed for a chronic condition there will be health consequences immediately or years down the road," Murawski said.
 "The detrimental health effects could lead to hospitalizations or the development of another illness, and this can be very expensive for both the individual and the health-care system as whole.
 It is very important to try to work with someone to solve any issues that could keep them from taking a drug as prescribed." In addition to the iPad tool, Murawski sees the potential for a kiosk version that could be integrated with a pharmacy's computer system.
 A patient could swipe an ID card or type in their name and the system would tailor the checklist to their medication records. He also hopes pharmacies could incorporate the results into a patient's record and maintain an ongoing history that would allow for more in-depth questions with each subsequent visit.
 "Currently we present a patient with five questions that get about 50 to 60 percent of all side effects," he said. "If we have more time and can continue down the list of questions and get more specific, we could capture all known side effects.
" Murawski plans to continue to accumulate checklist results and gather data about the incidence and severity of medication side effects in the general population and to further refine the PTRQoL tool.
 PTRQoL is available for licensing through Matt McFarland, associate director of commercialization in the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization, at 765-588-3487,

 Irish mezzo-soprano Naomi O'Connell reschedules Purdue performance
 WEST LAFAYETTE, IN—Irish mezzo-soprano Naomi O'Connell has rescheduled her Purdue University performance at Loeb Playhouse from Nov.
 1 to March 7, 2013. O'Connell was offered the lead role of Despina in the fall performances of Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte, a co-production of the Juilliard School and the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist training program.
 The director is Stephen Wadsworth, who recently directed O'Connell in Master Class for the West End run in London. "This opera performance is a major engagement for Ms.
 O'Connell and we're so proud of this accomplishment, as it further validates her status as a rising star," said Todd Wetzel, director of 
Purdue Convocations. "We're thrilled to have found a new date for her recital performance at Purdue."

 IU Health Arnett plans investment in Lyles-Porter Hall
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University has announced that it will receive a $1 million investment from Indiana University Health Arnett for construction of the new Lyles-Porter Hall.
 Lyles-Porter Hall will house the Indiana University School of Medicine-Lafayette, along with the Purdue Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences and other health programs.
 In recognition of the investment, a collaborative learning studio in Lyles-Porter Hall will be named for IU Health Arnett. "We are making this investment to support the medical education that is taking place in our community and the training of our future physicians,
" said Al Gatmaitan, IU Health Arnett chief executive officer. "IU Health Arnett values team-based health care, and this commitment will enhance our local medical education experience.
” Each year 32 first- and second-year IU medical students are placed at the Indiana University School of Medicine-Lafayette medical education center on the Purdue campus.
 "With our move to Lyles-Porter Hall, we will be able to house the planned increase to 48 students with a maximum capacity of 64 students in the first two years of their studies, " said Gordon Coppoc, associate dean of the IU School of Medicine and director of the IU School of Medicine-Lafayette.
 "Thanks to generous supporters like IU Health Arnett, the IU School of Medicine Purdue campus facilities in which these future physicians train will better facilitate the modern, robust curriculum.
 Exam rooms, space for a simulated mannequin and other areas will provide an environment more appropriate for medical training. These students may well end up practicing medicine in the Greater Lafayette area.
" The building is expected to open in 2014. IU School of Medicine-Lafayette currently is housed in Lynn Hall. The Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences also has a partnership with the IU School of Medicine's Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in its Doctor of Audiology Program.
 "Lyles-Porter Hall will benefit a large number of students studying in a variety of areas related to health," said Christine Ladisch, dean of the College of Health and Human Sciences.
 "We are very appreciative of the partnership with IU Health Arnett and grateful for their help in providing these students with a world-class facility.
" Lyles-Porter Hall, with 61,000 assignable square feet, will be located at the northwest corner of Harrison and University streets in an area of campus known as the Life and Health Sciences Park.
 The collaborative learning studio will be a high-tech classroom designed for small-group and team learning experiences. It will seat up to 63 students at seven round tables.
 Lyles-Porter Hall is named in honor of Purdue alumna Marybeth Lyles-Porter Higuera of Visalia, Calif. Higuera is a former speech pathologist who earned her bachelor's degree in speech-language pathology in 1959.

 IVDiagnostics establishes new lab to monitor, measure cancer cells
 MERRILLVILLE, Ind. - A Northwest Indiana life-sciences company has increased its presence at the Purdue Technology Center of Northwest Indiana by establishing a new laboratory to expand research that monitors and measures cells for improved cancer treatments.
 IVDiagnostics develops, tests and markets diagnostic tools that measure and monitor cancer tumor cells. The company's technology identifies circulating tumor cells, which are released from primary cancer tumors into the bloodstream and then lodge at distant organs to begin new cancer growth.
 Health-care providers use the information from IVDiagnostics to determine cancer treatment effectiveness. "Our company supports the goals of raising the bar for molecular medicine," said Frank Szczepanski, CEO of IVDiagnostics.
 "Our expanded life sciences lab will enable us to provide even more detailed information for improved cancer treatments." Thomas Szczepanski, director of marketing and support systems at IVDiagnostics, described why the company decided to expand in Purdue Technology Center.
 "The Purdue Technology Center of Northwest Indiana is ideally equipped to offer readily available space and state-of-the-art facilities for companies such as IVDiagnostics," he said.
 Frank Szczepanski also spoke about the opportunity to create a center for advanced cancer research in Northwest Indiana that can have a global impact.
 He is chief operating officer of The Foundation for Molecular Medicine, a group that supports research on improving the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, heart and neurodegenerative diseases.
 "We strongly feel that teaching more biotechnology courses in Northwest Indiana, having regional hospitals put advanced molecular diagnostics and treatment options into practice, and doing more research collaboration between clinicians and biotech firms will be a driving force for collaboration among universities, hospitals, students and professors to learn and put into practice non-toxic molecular diagnosis and treatment alternatives," he said.
 "Together, with other biotech companies at both the Purdue Technology Center of Northwest Indiana and throughout the Midwest, we can make this happen.
" IVDiagnostics is a biomedical diagnostic company focused on molecular diagnostic tests for circulating tumor cells and other blood-borne diseases.
 The company's mission is to save lives by providing oncologists and pathologists with better diagnostics tools for monitoring blood-borne diseases.
 The Foundation for Molecular Medicine is dedicated to supporting research on improving diagnosis and therapy of cancer, heart attacks and neurodegenerative diseases.
 Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The park network is home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.

 IVDiagnostics opens office in Purdue Research Park of Northwest Indiana
 IVDiagnostics LLC has developed a system that includes proprietary software to measure and monitor the level of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in a patient's bloodstream.
 The company has opened an office in the Purdue Research Park of Northwest Indiana. (IVDiagnostics photo) MERRILLVILLE, Ind. - A company that develops, tests and markets diagnostic tools that measure and monitor cancer tumor cells is expanding its presence in Northwest Indiana by opening an office in the Purdue Research Park of Northwest Indiana.
 IVDiagnostics LLC has developed tools that target circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which are released from primary cancer tumors into the bloodstream and then lodge at distant organs to begin new cancer growth.
 Health-care providers use the information to determine the effectiveness of cancer treatments. The company was founded by Frank Szczepanski, Tom Szczepanski and Wei He in 2008.
 Frank Szczepanski is president and CEO. "Our IVD CTC Assay is an in vitro assay that specifically measures circulating tumor cells in a patient's blood sample.
 It assists clinicians with monitoring tumor cells in real time, providing them a tool to determine the effectiveness of therapy," Frank Szczepanski said.
 "The IVDxTx platform is our in vivo device that monitors a patient's CTC level and performs real-time diagnosis without taking blood.
 Clinicians can monitor these cells with higher sensitivity, less patient anxiety and greater ease of use over other tools." Frank Szczepanski said current methods to diagnose cancer have drawbacks compared to IVDiagnostics' tools.
 "Clinicians currently use cancer assays like the test for prostate cancer that measures antigen or rejection response in the bloodstream," he said.
 "These are indirect signs of cancer tumors, unlike CTCs, so they may not be as accurate as our tools." He said IVDiagnostics has completed pre-clinical studies and looks to launch its first pilot trial with human cancer patients.
 "The trial will be conducted with breast cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer patients to determine if there is more sensitivity with one type of cancer or the other based on the results," he said.
 "My colleagues and I then will decide which cancer type to move forward with for a pivotal trial." Szczepanski said IVDiagnostics is expanding, but not moving its entire operation by opening an office at the Purdue Research Park of Northwest Indiana.
 "The facility in Merrillville will help us have closer ties and proximity to our medical partners in Northwest Indiana," he said.
 IVDiagnostics has been recognized in the Congressional Record, and has received awards from the Northwest Indiana Society of Innovators (Chanute Prize), Northwest Indiana Small Business Development Center (Revolutionary Technology award) and the World Future Society (Top 15 Beta Futurist award).
 IVDiagnostics was formed to develop, test and market more effective diagnostic tools for addressing rare circulating tumor cells and blood borne diseases.
 By collaborating with several academic and commercial partners, the company has accelerated its research and development. Within a short period of time, IVDiagnostics has assembled a team of researchers, scientists, medical advisers, scientific advisers and clinicians - all passionate about moving toward personalized medicine and focused on assisting physicians with the knowledge of ''what's inside" the body, and providing the ability to monitor the patient's circulatory system with minimally invasive techniques.
 The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The park network is home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Merrillville, Indianapolis and New Albany.

 Jazz organ legend Dr. Lonnie Smith to perform in Lafayette
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The jazz ensemble Dr. Lonnie Smith Trio will perform at the Long Center for the Performing Arts at 8 p.m.
 Oct. 5. This performance is presented by Purdue Convocations and includes a preshow discussion that begins at 6:45 p.m. Don Seybold, host of "Inside Jazz" on WBAA Radio, and organist Jamie Newman will discuss the art of the jazz organ trio.
 Simultaneously legendary and enigmatic, Dr. Lonnie Smith is one of the most original voices on the Hammond B3 organ - the classic instrument heard throughout jazz, rock and gospel music.
 He arrived on the scene in the 1950s during the heyday of the jazz organ trio format, in which the organ is joined by guitar and drums.
 Now 70, Smith remains an innovative and influential force in modern music, especially as he finds his riffs sampled and remixed by current rap, house mix, acid jazz and dance artists.
 No genre is safe from his own transformative touch, as Lonnie has reimagined the music of The Beatles, John Coltrane, Beck and Eurythmics, and even released a tribute album to Jimi Hendrix.
 His trio is rounded out by colleagues Jonathan Kreisberg and Jamire Williams. Tickets are $26 for adults and $19 for those 18 and younger, Purdue students, and Ivy Tech Lafayette students.
 Tickets are available at Elliott Hall and Stewart Center box offices at 765-494-3933 or 800-914-SHOW. Tickets are also available through Ticketmaster outlets.
 Discounted tickets for groups of 10 or more can be ordered at 765-496-1977. Initiated in 1902, Purdue Convocations was one of the first professional performing arts presenters in the United States.
 Each year, Convocations offers the region 20-30 performances of widely varying genres: Broadway-style shows, theater, dance, children's theater, world music, jazz and chamber music, along with rock, pop, country and comedy attractions.
 With a vision for connecting artists and audiences in artistic dialogue and for drawing in academic discourse, Purdue Convocations aims to promote frequent exposure to and familiarity with human cultural expression in a multitude of forms and media.

 Kane named inaugural director of LGBTQ Center at Purdue
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Lowell Kane has been appointed director of Purdue's Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Center, university officials announced Monday (July 2).
 Kane comes to Purdue from Texas A&M University, where he has been program coordinator and founding staff member of the Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center.
 Established in 2007, it was the first GLBT resource center at a public institution in Texas. "Lowell has been an advocate and leader in the LGBTQ community for more than a decade, with specializations in educational programming, support services, fostering collaborative partnerships, facilitation, training and leadership development," said G.
 Christine Taylor, vice provost for diversity and inclusion. "He has dedicated his work to the pursuit of equity by identifying ways to improve campus climate and shape the educational experience to be more inclusive and welcoming of all students.
" In his position at Texas A&M, Kane focused on education, outreach and support. He also served as the south-central regional representative to the Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals and presented at state and national conferences on a variety of LGBT topics.
 "I am eager to begin my work at Purdue," Kane said. "I believe my experience at Texas A&M, particularly establishing the GLBT center and developing campus-wide programming has prepared me well for my new position.
" In 2010, Kane was consulted by RAND Corp. for the implementation chapter of the 2010 publication "Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: An Update of RAND's 1993 Study.
" He said this text was the framework for implementing the repeal of the U.S. military's "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy, which forbade gay men and lesbians from being open about their sexual orientation while serving.
 "NASA wants to develop an environment that affirms a diverse employee population that is free from discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression," Kane said.
 Kane earned his bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where he served as president of the LGBT Alliance and as an adviser on LGBT issues to campus administrators and faculty.
 He received a master's degree in education from Texas A&M and is an alumnus of the Social Justice Training Institute. While at Texas A&M, he received the Phyllis Frye Advocacy Award and the Texas A&M Division of Student Affairs Award of Distinction and the Student Organization Adviser of the Year Award.

 Krannert to offer updated human resource management program
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University's Krannert School of Management will offer a revised Master of Science degree focusing on human resource management program next fall.
The revision will make the Human Resource Management (HRM) program a more professionally focused and market-competitive option for students.
 It will be a 48-credit offering that can be completed in three semesters and will include a global and experiential learning component.
"The new HRM curriculum represents an innovative approach to human resource management," said P. Christopher Earley, dean of the Krannert School and James Brooke Henderson Professor of Management.
 "It also maintains a tradition within our school that has produced leaders in HR management with a strong business focus for more than three decades.
"HRM students will complete a management core of business analytics, organizational behavior, managerial communication and employment law.
 They can select three of six courses in the areas of accounting, finance, marketing, operations, strategic management and economics.
 The management core is 16 hours, the strongest requirement among peer institutions with similar programs. The human resource core classes will comprise 12 hours.
 Students may choose from a menu of organizational behavior and human resource management electives for six credit hours, and free electives for an additional nine credit hours.
 The final five credit-hour requirements will be any combination of global experience and/or experiential learning opportunities.
 Students may spend a module at the GISMA Business School in Hannover, Germany, or participate in one of the international study trips offered around the globe.
 They also may take part in programs such as Purdue's Experiential Learning Initiative, which allows students to combine prior knowledge and experience with classroom learning and apply it in an active business setting.
 The projects are executed under faculty supervision."This will offer students the best contemporary combination of human resources and business management training," said Brad Alge, associate professor of management and area coordinator in organizational behavior and human resources.
 "With a management core, expanded experiential learning and international study options, the Krannert HRM program is now positioned to achieve our vision of leading the human resources marketplace by producing HR-focused, business-savvy leaders for today's global organizations.
"The HRM program will begin each August and conclude in December of the next year, giving students the opportunity to do an internship during the summer before the final semester.
The Purdue MBA, which spans four semesters, still offers options in organizational behavior and human resources for students desiring to take more courses in the management core.

 Life-science firm that received federal, Purdue funding is generating revenue
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Purdue-based new venture that develops nanotechnology to improve research and development in life-science companies, pharmaceutical companies and cancer research centers has succeeded in generating its first revenues from sales after only two years in business.
 Tymora Analytical Operations LLC has begun selling its PolyMAC product to university professors and industry researchers. The technology, which promotes the discovery of new cancer drugs in laboratory settings, is based on research by W.
 Andy Tao, an associate professor in Purdue's Department of Biochemistry. Anton Iliuk is the company's president and chief technology officer.
 Iliuk said PolyMAC helps drug developers and researchers discover new cancer drug targets and analyze the source of drug resistance after prolonged treatment.
 "PolyMAC more correctly pinpoints whether a candidate for drug development is targeting the intended proteins," he said. "Researchers can feel more confident in their results because PolyMAC is a more reliable and sensitive tool, which is a key in effective early-stage drug discovery.
" Tymora Analytical Operations has received funding from several sources to develop Tao's research into commercialized products. These sources include the National Science Foundation, Purdue's Emerging Innovations Fund and business plan competitions, including the Burton D.
 Morgan Business Plan Competition. Elizabeth Hart-Wells, assistant vice president and director of the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization, said Purdue's Emerging Innovations Fund strengthens early-stage companies that license technology from the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization or are based in the Purdue Research Park, aiming to increase their chances of successful commercialization.
 Richard Cosier, the Avrum and Joyce Gray Director of the Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, said students from Purdue University's Krannert School of Management participated in the due diligence process to select Emerging Innovation Fund recipients.
 Iliuk said the Emerging Innovations Fund is more likely than other sources to take a chance on promising technology at an earlier stage.
 "The Emerging Innovations Fund funding we received has allowed us to commercialize and start marketing and make the first sales of our first product, PolyMAC, and will support our commercialization efforts for the next product release in the near future," he said.
 Tymora Analytical Operations was established in 2010 to provide new nanotechnology-based products to serve the R&D market in the life sciences.
 Tymora has developed a nanoscale platform technology - with PolyMAC and pIMAGO as the lead products - for unmet needs in analysis of protein phosphorylation that relates to the onset of numerous diseases, most notably cancer.
 The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The park network is home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.

 Low oxygen boosts stem cell survival in muscular dystrophy therapy

(Purdue University image/Weiyi Liu and Shihuan Kuang)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Controlling the amount of oxygen that stem cells are exposed to can significantly increase the effectiveness of a procedure meant to combat an often fatal form of muscular dystrophy, according to Purdue University research.
 A genetic mutation in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes the constant breakdown of muscles and gradual depletion of stem cells that are responsible for repairing the damage and progressive muscle wasting.
 A healthy stem cell tends to duplicate in a regular pattern that creates one copy of itself that continues to function as a stem cell, and a differentiated cell, which performs a specific function.
 In a healthy person, a torn or damaged muscle would be repaired through this process. Stem cell therapy - implanting healthy stem cells to combat tissue wasting - has shown promise against muscular dystrophy and other neurodegenerative diseases, but few of the implanted stem cells survive the procedure.
 Shihuan Kuang, a Purdue assistant professor of animal sciences, and Weiyi Liu, a postdoctoral research associate, showed that survival of implanted muscle stem cells could be increased by as much as fivefold in a mouse model if the cells are cultured under oxygen levels similar to those found in human muscles.
 "Stem cells survive in a microenvironment in the body that has a low oxygen level," Kuang said. "But when we culture cells, there is a lot of oxygen around the petri dish.
 We wanted to see if less oxygen could mimic that microenvironment. When we did that, we saw that more stem cells survived the transplant.
" Liu thinks that's because the stem cells grown in higher oxygen levels acclimate to their surroundings. When they're injected into muscles with lower oxygen levels, they essentially suffocate.
 "By contrast, in our study the cells become used to the host environment when they are conditioned under low oxygen levels prior to transplantation," Liu said.
 In the mouse model, Kuang and Liu saw more stem cells survive the transplants, and those stem cells retained their ability to duplicate themselves.
 "When we lower the oxygen level, we can also maintain the self-renewal process," Kuang said. "If these stem cells self-renew, they should never be used up and should continue to repair damaged muscle.
" The findings, reported in the journal Development, shows promise for increasing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects about one in 3,500 boys starting at about 3-5 years old.
 The disease, which confines almost all patients to wheelchairs by their 20s, is often fatal as muscles that control the abilities to breathe and eat deteriorate.
 Xiaoqi Liu, a Purdue associate professor of biochemistry, and several graduate students contributed to the study. Kuang's research will now focus on the signaling pathways within stem cells to understand how oxygen levels affect their functions and examining whether human muscle stem cells are similarly regulated by environmental oxygen.
 The National Institutes of Health, the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the U.S. Department of Agriculture funded the research.
 ABSTRACT Hypoxia Promotes Satellite Cell Self-renewal and Enhances the Efficiency of Myoblast Transplantation Microenvironmental oxygen (O
2) regulates stem cell activity, and a hypoxic niche with low oxygen levels has been reported in multiple stem cell types. Satellite cells are muscle-resident stem cells that maintain the homeostasis and mediate the regeneration of skeletal muscles.
 We demonstrate here that hypoxic culture conditions favor the quiescence of satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts by upregulating Pax7, a key regulator of satellite cell self-renewal, and downregulating MyoD and myogenin.
 During myoblast division, hypoxia promotes asymmetric self-renewal divisions and inhibits asymmetric differentiation divisions without affecting the overall rate of proliferation.
 Mechanistic studies reveal that hypoxia activates the Notch signaling pathway, which subsequently represses the expression of miR-1 and miR-206 through canonical Hes/Hey proteins, leading to increased levels of Pax7.
 More importantly, hypoxia conditioning enhances the efficiency of myoblast transplantation and the self-renewal of implanted cells.
 Given the robust effects of hypoxia on maintaining the quiescence and promoting the self-renewal of cultured myoblasts, we predict that oxygen levels in the satellite cell niche play a central role in precisely balancing quiescence versus activation, and self-renewal versus differentiation, in muscle stem cells in vivo.

 Machine tracing history of Rube Goldberg competition wins local contest

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A team from the Purdue Society of Professional Engineers and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers on Saturday (Feb.
 25) won the 30th annual Purdue Regional Rube Goldberg Machine Contest with a machine that traces the competition's history. The Rube Goldberg competition, sponsored by Phi Chapter of Theta Tau fraternity, rewards machines that most effectively combine creativity with inefficiency and complexity.
 The task this year was to inflate and pop a balloon. The winning machine took 300 steps to do 25 different tasks - this year's challenge and 24 past challenges, including changing a light bulb, shutting off an alarm clock and peeling an apple.
 Last year, the same team created a machine that had 244 steps, winning it a spot in the "Guinness Book of World Records" for most steps by a Rube Goldberg machine.
 To break that record with this year's machine, the team had to complete a run with no human interventions. That didn't happen Saturday when a part feeding a steam boiler failed.
 The team was required to go to its Plan B, an air pump to inflate the balloon, which required a human touch to start it. Zach Umperovitch, president of the team, said the 14 team members spent 5,000 combined hours building the machine.
 Machines must use at least 20 steps to complete the task in no more than two minutes. Teams have three tries to complete two runs.
 Points are deducted if students have to assist the machine once it has started. The winning machine completed all three runs. Its best run took one minute, 38 seconds with two human interventions.
 The PSPE/SHPE machine required a unique design to fit all of its steps into the framework limits, Umperovitch said. The top half of the machine rotates horizontally to accommodate some of the many tasks it accomplishes.
 The team now will compete in the national Rube Goldberg contest, to be held at Purdue on March 31. "We'll replace the boiler hoses.
 Other than that, we'll just make some tweaks before the national contest," Umperovitch said. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers took second place with a machine based on Looney Tunes cartoon characters.
 A machine by the Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists and the Society of Black Engineers took third with a Mayan calendar-end of the world theme.
 Sponsors for this year's event are Alcoa, Lockheed Martin, Priio, Rockwell Collins, Omega Engineering, and the Purdue Colleges of Engineering and Technology and the School of Mechanical Engineering.
 Four high schools also participated in a regional Rube Goldberg Machine contest at Purdue on Saturday (Feb. 25). The winner was Anderson High School.
 That team will go to the national contest March 17 at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Mich. Marion's Eastbrook High School took second place.
 Owen Valley High School, Spencer, was third. Kouts High School also participated. The high school event was coordinated by the Purdue Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists.
 Goldberg specialized in drawing whimsical machines with complex mechanisms to perform simple tasks. He earned a degree in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1904.
 He worked as an engineer for the city of San Francisco for less than a year before becoming a sports cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle.
 He received a Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for his political cartoons published by the New York Sun. Note to Journalists: Broadcast-quality video B-Roll and sound bites are available for download at

 Meeting to discuss feasibility, future of food hub
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue Extension will present results of a feasibility study for a food hub in central Indiana and explain the next steps in creating a business plan for it.
 The meeting will be 7-8:30 p.m. Tuesday (Aug. 21) at the Hancock County Public Library, 900 West McKenzie Road, Greenfield. It will include an overview of the food hub project as well as presentations and a panel discussion on a hub's contribution to the economy and health of central Indiana.
 Speakers will include Purdue Extension educator Roy Ballard and Prosperity Ag Energy consultant Sarah Aubrey. Food hubs match products from local farmers and growers with local consumers.
 They often serve a variety of functions, such as providing word-of-mouth publicity for small farmers and connecting commercial buyers with local suppliers.
 They also increase consumer access to fresh, homegrown products. The meeting's purpose is to present details of the feasibility study and business plans to the steering committee and to local government leaders, but farmers, growers and consumers are invited to attend so they can learn more about what a food hub would mean for their communities.

 Mexican voters' take on 'good old days' will be key in presidential elections
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Many voters in Mexico's July 1 presidential election are likely to take a trip down memory lane when considering whether to support the incumbent party or the newly renovated old party, says a Purdue University expert.
 "People will be asking the incumbent party, 'What have you done for me lately?' and this type of retrospective voting is not unique," says political science professor 
James McCann, who studies political behavior in Mexico. "Typically, voters are reflecting over a couple of years, and if they feel things are going well they reward the incumbent party.
 If not, they opt for the other candidate. My survey work leading up to this election shows that as Mexico's problems with crime, violence and the economy continue to grow, voters are reaching even farther back to an earlier regime to evaluate today's candidates.
" The general populace is looking back more than a dozen years to before 2000, when the International Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, was in charge, McCann says.
 The 2000 general election marked Mexico's first multiparty election, and power shifted from PRI. Since 2000, the president's office has been represented by the National Action Party, known as PAN.
 McCann and a team of scholars are collecting and evaluating survey data to understand how Mexico is transitioning from the dominant-party era to the new democratic system.
 They also are comparing voting decisions, trends and campaign effectiveness. "Mexico is still a new democracy, and from a policy standpoint, it is important for Americans to follow events in Mexico and be aware of the quality of democratic representation in Mexico," McCann says.
 "The reality is that the country faces enormous problems, and it is hard to fault voters for being wistful about politics in the old days.
 But my take on this long-term retrospective view of times being better when PRI ruled everything is that such an attitude could serve as an indictment against the country's fledgling multiparty democratic system.
 "Even if PRI wins the presidency, we are not going to see a return to when one party rules everything. Those days are just gone.
 A new PRI president may not have an effective majority in congress and there may be opposition at the state level." McCann says younger voters, such as college students, are protesting the popular PRI candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto, but they are not supporting the other parties' candidates who are considered weaker.
 "Simply being against the PRI candidate is not going to hurt him," McCann says. "In fact, the more we see protesting the more it can play into his stance that he represents harmony and order.
" These recent survey findings were presented at the May Latin American Studies Association conference, and they will be compared with additional survey results before and after the election.
 McCann also is the co-author of "Democratizing Mexico: Public Opinion and Electoral Choices."

 Mind over matter: Quench summer thirst, but measure beverage calories
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - People need to stay hydrated as summer temperatures soar, but consumers should be aware that calories can quickly add up when you drink to cool down, says a Purdue University nutrition science expert.
"Beverages can be an important source of energy, and those calories can add up quickly when the warm weather prompts people to drink more often," says 
Richard D. Mattes, distinguished professor of nutrition science. "It is critical that people are properly hydrated during hot weather.
 Fortunately, there are many affordable and palatable no-calorie and low-calorie beverage options to meet the need. When drinking a beverage with energy, measured by calories, consumers need to consciously monitor the calories and adjust their diet or physical activity levels.
 Otherwise, those calories will add to each day's total and can lead to a gain of body weight."Most experts agree that beverage consumption influences body weight, but there are still questions about how these liquid calories make a difference.
"Are all calories treated equally by the body? The emerging clear answer is, no. Energy from beverages does not produce as strong a satiety response - feeling full - as solid foods.
 Consequently, people may consume a large amount of energy before realizing they have done so," says Mattes, who also is director of the Ingestive Behavior Research Center at Purdue.
 "Over time, human drinking has transformed from a behavior that just meets hydration needs to one that also contributes substantively to energy needs and probably surpluses.
 About 20 percent of our daily energy intake is from beverages, and, from an evolutionary perspective, that is a radical change in our dietary behavior.
 For example, wild primates obtain about 80 percent of their daily water needs from food by eating succulent plants. Humans now consume about 80 percent of their daily water from beverages.
"Another dramatic change with today's eating habits is a greater eating frequency, often referred to as snacking, Mattes says."The more often you eat, the more likely you are to have higher energy intake and gain weight," he says.
 "Today, 40 percent to 50 percent of snacking involves beverages. Because this source of energy has weak effects of appetite and is often consumed at non-meal times, beverages propose a unique challenge to weight management.

 Mintert to lead Purdue Extension in interim
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Jim Mintert, assistant director of agriculture and natural resources for Purdue Extension since 2009, has been appointed interim associate dean of the College of Agriculture and interim director of Extension.
 Chuck Hibberd, the current associate dean and director, has accepted a similar position at the University of Nebraska, effective Oct.
 1. Mintert will assume his new role Sept. 27 and serve until a permanent replacement is hired. A search committee has been appointed by Jay Akridge, Glenn W.
 Sample Dean of Purdue Agriculture. Mintert's work most recently includes coordinating Purdue Extension's response to this summer's drought, the worst drought in more than 50 years.
 "It is an effort that has been both important to our state and well received by our stakeholders," Akridge said. Before joining Purdue, Mintert spent 23 years at Kansas State University as professor and Extension state leader for agricultural economics.
 Mintert, who also is a professor of agricultural economics, holds bachelor's and master's degrees from Purdue and a doctoral degree from the University of Missouri.
 He is the author of more than 200 publications on the economics of the livestock industry. He also has received numerous honors, including Outstanding Extension Program Awards from both the American Agricultural Economics Association and the Western Agricultural Economics Association, and the AAEA's Premier Forecaster Award for his livestock production and price forecasts.

 More crops affected as drought spreads throughout Indiana
 Limited moisture has left some soybean seeds sitting in dry soil beds. This field, near Clay City, Ind., shows a pattern of variable emergence due to limited soil moisture.
 (Purdue agronomy photo/Shaun Casteel) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Drought conditions around Indiana took a turn for the worse with 88 percent of the state now affected by ongoing dry weather, according to the latest U.S.
 Drought Monitor (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?IN,MW) released Thursday (June 14). The Drought Monitor, a service of the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture, is updated weekly and reflected conditions as of Tuesday (June 12). Total Indiana land area affected by drought jumped 40 percent since the last Drought Monitor was released last week.
 Only a cluster of 11 counties in southeast Indiana, about 12 percent of the state, are not affected. Moderate drought has spread to cover about three-fourths of northern Indiana while most of central Indiana is considered abnormally dry.
 Five counties in southwestern Indiana are rated in severe drought. The high-pressure system that has dominated the Midwest in recent weeks has prevented weather changes - including fronts bringing much-needed rain - from moving into the area, according to the Indiana State Climate Office (
http://iclimate.org/index.asp) based at Purdue University. The next possibility for showers is sometime late next week, but state climatologist Dev Niyogi said soil is losing moisture at a rate faster than it can be replaced.
 "We should not fall into false security if we get rain," Niyogi said. "Every passing day we are losing more moisture from the soil because of the growing crops.
 It will take time, conservation and much-needed rains to reverse." More soybeans around the state are showing signs of stress, said Purdue Extension agronomist Shaun Casteel.
 "I'm seeing more plants flipping leaves over to reflect the sun," he said. "These plants can probably recover without too much damage if we get rain.
" In areas of severe drought, leaves have started clamping down, meaning plants are going into survival mode. Some fields have become islands where some plants have emerged and others haven't, Casteel said.
 "Late-planted beans in dry soil might still emerge with rainfall. However, if the seed has cracked open and the root emerged it could become a worst-case scenario.
" After several weeks with little or no rain, the condition of the state's corn crop runs the gamut, said Purdue Extension agronomist Bob Nielsen.
 Several areas of the state are under severe stress and, early in the growing season, Nielsen said there's already concern about the impact it will have on yield.
 Other areas around the state are not exhibiting drought symptoms. "If we begin to get rain, the corn crop won't recover completely, but it will be better than we thought," Nielsen said.
 More moderate temperatures since Memorial Day have helped, Nielsen said, but a return to hotter weather and continued drought could tip the scales.
 "We're tip-toeing on the edge of something serious," he said. "Right now, it's wait-and-see; it could go either way." Nielsen said the corn crop under the most stress is consistent with areas of severest drought in the U.S.

 More rain needed to show lessening of drought in Indiana
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Although parts of Indiana got a good drenching over the past week, a longer trend of significant rainfall is needed before the U.S.
 Drought Monitor shows a reversal of dryness that has been intensifying since the spring. The Drought Monitor (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?IN,MW
) update of Thursday (Aug. 9) showed very minor improvement in drought conditions in extreme east-central Indiana. Most of the state remains in extreme or exceptional drought - the two highest levels.
 That is despite rain of at least 3 inches in some areas, especially the southwest, and lesser amounts in the north. "The Drought Monitor is unlikely to show lessening of drought based on only a week of decent precipitation," said Ken Scheeringa, associate state climatologist based at Purdue University.
 So even though heavier rain has started to fall, evaporation and runoff will immediately take away some of this new moisture. "There needs to be longer-term improvement before there are widespread changes in drought categories.
 Since April 1, the state still shows rainfall deficits of 5-11 inches." Drought worsened in the southern extent of east-central Indiana and the southeast because rain last weekend largely bypassed that section of the state.
 The State Climate Office provides a map of weekly rainfall on its website. The latest map is at http://iclimate.org/precip/images/2012/08/Week1_7_Aug_2012.gif

 Moving? Making friends key to turning new house into a home
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Whether someone relocates a fewmiles or states away, meeting new neighbors and friends is just as vital asunpacking, says a Purdue University communication expert.
 "Americans generally fail to count the relationalcost of a geographic relocation," says Glenn Sparks, professor ofcommunication.
 "People moving may feel like they don't have time becausethey are trying to anchor their new lives, but those relocating this summershould think carefully about this aspect of their life as soon as they can.There are many ways to keep in touch with the friends left behind, but textingand social media don't capture real conversation.
 And conversation is thetapestry that keeps us healthy because it truly keeps us connected to otherpeople." * Mute phone and notifications: Leave the phone inside tocharge while outside introducing yourself to neighbors.
 * Take advantage of the weather and spend more timeoutside - the front yard, park or community festival - to meet people. * Go offline: Limit the time spent on Facebook and othersites connecting with old friends.
 Instead, look for local communitygroups. * Learn from children: Children make friends easier thanadults, and there are opportunities to meet other parents at children-centeredactivities.
 "It takes effort to establish these new face-to-facerelationships, but they are crucial for daily well-being," says Sparks,who is co-author of "Refrigerator Rights: Our Crucial Need for CloseConnection.
" Sparks, and the book's co-author, Will Miller, say thatbecause people are moving farther and more regularly, there is a greater voidin face-to-face relationships.
 "We are losing conversation, because the value ofconversation is being dropped with electronic technology," Sparks says."Face-to-face conversation is the grist of building relationships.
" In 2009 the American Community Survey reported that morethan 15 percent of the population had moved. The survey also reported thatyoung adults ages 18-29 were the most mobile group of the U.S.
 population. Sparks says those who see new people moving into theirneighborhoods or buildings are not excluded from this message.
 "People already settled have home court advantage, sotake the time to greet new neighbors," Sparks says. "Just make apoint to spend a few minutes each night outside instead of rushing into an airconditioned house to check email or Facebook.

 'Nano machine shop' shapes nanowires, ultrathin films
 This illustration depicts a new nano machine shop's ability to shape tiny wires, an advance that represents a possible future manufacturing method for applications ranging from high-speed electronics to solar cells.
 (Purdue University image/Gary Cheng)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – A new "nano machine shop" that shapes nanowires and ultrathin films could represent a future manufacturing method for tiny structures with potentially revolutionary properties.
 The structures might be tuned for applications ranging from high-speed electronics to solar cells and also may have greater strength and unusual traits such as ultrahigh magnetism and "plasmonic resonance," which could lead to improved optics, computers and electronics.
 The researchers used their technique to stamp nano- and microgears; form tiny circular shapes out of a material called graphene, an ultrathin sheet of carbon that holds promise for advanced technologies; and change the shape of silver nanowires, said 
Gary Cheng, an associate professor of industrial engineering at Purdue University. "We do this shaping at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, like a nano-machine shop," said Cheng, who is working with doctoral students Ji Li, Yiliang Liao, Ting-Fung Chung and Sergey Suslov and physics professor Yong P.
 Chen. Graphene and nanowires – filaments 1,000 times thinner than a human hair – have numerous potential applications. However, technologies are needed to tailor them for specific uses.
 The new method, called laser shock-induced shaping, makes it possible to tune nanowires by altering electrical and optoelectrical properties that are critical for electronic components.
 The researchers also have shown how laser shock-induced shaping can be used to change the properties of graphene, a step toward harnessing the material for electronic applications.
 Findings were detailed in research papers published in the journal Nano Letters, and the work also was highlighted earlier this month in the News and Views section of the journal 
Nature Photonics. (The article is available at http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v6/n8/full/nphoton.2012.186.html) The technique works by using a multilayered sandwich structure that has a tiny mold at the bottom.
 Nanowires were situated directly above the mold, and other materials were layered between the nanowires and a glass cover sheet.
 Exposing this layered "forming unit" to an ultra-fast pulsing laser causes one of the layers to burn up, generating a downward pressure that forces the nanowires into the mold and changes their shape.
 "The process could be scaled up for an industrial roll-to-roll manufacturing process by changing laser beam size and scanning speed," Cheng said.
 "The laser shock-induced shaping approach is fast and low-cost." Part of the research, funded by the National Science Foundation, was carried out in a specialized clean room at the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue's Discovery Park.

 Graphene has many promising physical properties. It has been discovered that local strain in a graphene sheet can alter its conducting properties and transport gaps.
 It is of great importance to develop scalable strain engineering techniques to control the local strains in graphene and understand the limit of the strains.
 Here, we present a scalable manufacturing process to generate 3-D nanostructures and thus induce local strains in the graphene sheet.
 This process utilizes laser induced shock pressure to generate 3-D tunable straining the graphene sheet. The size dependent straining limit of the graphene and the critical breaking pressure are both studied.
 It is found that the graphene film can be formed to a circular mold (&#126;50nm in diameter) with an aspect ratio of 0.25 and strain of 12%, and the critical breaking pressure is 1.77GPa.
 These values were found to be decreasing with the increase of mold size. The local straining and breaking of graphene film are verified by Raman spectra.
 Large scale processing of the graphene sheet into nano-scale patterns is presented. The process could be scaled up to roll-to-roll process by changing laser beam size and scanning speed.
 The presented laser shock straining approach is a fast, tunable and low-cost technique to realize strain engineering of graphene for its applications in nano-electrical devices.
 ABSTRACT One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted a great deal of research interest in the past few decades due to their unique mechanical, electrical and optical properties.
 Changing the shape of nanowires (NWs) is both challenging and crucial to change the property and open wide functions of NWs, such as strain engineering, electronic transport, mechanical properties, band structure and quantum properties, etc.
 Here we report a scalable strategy to conduct cutting, bending and periodic straining of NWs by making use of laser shock pressure.
 Three-dimensional shaping of silver NWs is demonstrated, during which the Ag NWs exhibit very good ductility (strain-to-failure reaches 110%).
 Meanwhile, the high electrical conductivity of Ag NWs could retain well under controlled laser shock pressure. The microstructure observation indicates that the main deformation mechanism in Ag NWs under dynamic loading is formation of twinning and stacking fault, while dislocation motion and pile-up is less obvious.
 This method could be applied to semiconductor NWs as well.

 'Nanoresonators' might improve cell phone performance
 This image from a scanning electron microscope shows a tiny mechanical device, an electrostatically actuated nanoresonator, that might ease congestion over the airwaves to improve the performance of cell phones and other portable devices.
 (Purdue University image)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Researchers have learned how to mass produce tiny mechanical devices that could help cell phone users avoid the nuisance of dropped calls and slow downloads.
 The devices are designed to ease congestion over the airwaves to improve the performance of cell phones and other portable devices.
 "There is not enough radio spectrum to account for everybody's handheld portable device," said Jeffrey Rhoads, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University.
 The overcrowding results in dropped calls, busy signals, degraded call quality and slower downloads. To counter the problem, industry is trying to build systems that operate with more sharply defined channels so that more of them can fit within the available bandwidth.
 "To do that you need more precise filters for cell phones and other radio devices, systems that reject noise and allow signals only near a given frequency to pass," said 
Saeed Mohammadi, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering who is working with Rhoads, doctoral student Hossein Pajouhi and other researchers.
 The Purdue team has created devices called nanoelectromechanical resonators, which contain a tiny beam of silicon that vibrates when voltage is applied.
 Researchers have shown that the new devices are produced with a nearly 100 percent yield, meaning nearly all of the devices created on silicon wafers were found to function properly.
 "We are not inventing a new technology, we are making them using a process that's amenable to large-scale fabrication, which overcomes one of the biggest obstacles to the widespread commercial use of these devices," Rhoads said.
 Findings are detailed in a research paper appearing online in the journal IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology. The paper was written by doctoral students Lin Yu and Pajouhi, Rhoads, Mohammadi, and graduate student Molly Nelis.
 In addition to their use as future cell phone filters, such nanoresonators also could be used for advanced chemical and biological sensors in medical and homeland-defense applications and possibly as components in computers and electronics.
 The devices are created using silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, fabrication - the same method used by industry to manufacture other electronic devices.
 The resonators can be readily integrated into electronic circuits and systems because SOI is compatible with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology, or CMOS, another mainstay of electronics manufacturing used to manufacture computer chips.
 The new device is said to be "highly tunable," which means it could enable researchers to overcome manufacturing inconsistencies that are common in nanoscale devices.
 "Because of manufacturing differences, no two nanoscale devices perform the same rolling off of the assembly line," Rhoads said.
 "You must be able to tune them after processing, which we can do with these devices." The heart of the device is a silicon beam attached at two ends.
 The beam, which vibrates in the center like a jump rope, is about two microns long and 130 nanometers wide, or about 1,000 times thinner than a human hair.
 Applying alternating current to the beam causes it to selectively vibrate side-to-side or up and down and also allows the beam to be finely adjusted, or tuned.
 The nanoresonators were shown to control their vibration frequencies better than other resonators. The devices might replace electronic parts to achieve higher performance and lower power consumption.
 "A vivid example is a tunable filter," Mohammadi said. "It is very difficult to make a good tunable filter with transistors, inductors and other electronic components, but a simple nanomechanical resonator can do the job with much better performance and at a fraction of the power.
" Not only are they more efficient than their electronic counterparts, he said, but they also are more compact. "Because the devices are tiny and the fabrication has almost a 100 percent yield, we can pack millions of these devices in a small chip if we need to," Mohammadi said.
 "It's too early to know exactly how these will find application in computing, but since we can make these tiny mechanical devices as easily as transistors, we should be able to mix and match them with each other and also with transistors in order to achieve specific functions.
 Not only can you put them side-by-side with standard computer and electronic chips, but they tend to work with near 100 percent reliability.
" The new resonators could provide higher performance than previous MEMS, or microelectromechanical systems. In sensing application, the design enables researchers to precisely measure the frequency of the vibrating beam, which changes when a particle lands on it.
 Analyzing this frequency change allows researchers to measure minute masses. Similar sensors are now used to research fundamental scientific questions.
 However, recent advances may allow for reliable sensing with portable devices, opening up a range of potential applications, Rhoads said.
 Such sensors have promise in detecting and measuring constituents such as certain proteins or DNA for biological testing in liquids, gases and the air, and the NEMS might find applications in breath analyzers, industrial and food processing, national security and defense, and food and water quality monitoring.
 "The smaller your system, the smaller the mass you can measure," Rhoads said. "Most of the field-deployable sensors we've seen in the past have been based on microscale technologies, so this would be hundreds or thousands of times smaller, meaning we should eventually be able to measure things that much smaller.
" The work is based at the Dynamic Analysis of Micro- and Nanosystems Laboratory at the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue's Discovery Park.
 Other faculty members and graduate students also use the specialized facility. The researchers have filed a patent application for the concept.
 The research is funded by the National Science Foundation. Note to Journalists: An electronic copy of the research paper is available from Emil Venere, 765-494-4709, 
venere@purdue.edu ABSTRACT Lin Yu, Hossein Pajouhi, Molly R. Nelis, Jeffrey F. Rhoads, and Saeed Mohammadi, Senior Member, IEEE Resonant nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) have the potential to have significant impact in mass sensing, signal processing and field detection applications if the challenges associated with processing, material and geometric variability can be mitigated.
 The research presented here details a breakthrough in the design and development of resonant NEMS aimed at addressing these challenges.
 Specifically, the work details the fabrication, characterization and tuning of dual-gate silicon nanoelectromechanical resonators, which are transduced electrostatically and realized with close to 100% yield.
 These devices are fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate using only top-down microfabrication techniques and can be easily integrated with SOI-CMOS transistors, enabling the development of fully integrated CMOS-NEMS with highly-tunable nonlinear frequency response characteristics.

 NASA taps Indiana firm to build device to study gravity's effects
 NEW ALBANY, Ind. - Astronauts in the International Space Station National Laboratory may use a device designed and developed by a technology company located at the Purdue Research Park of Southeast Indiana to study how gravity affects living things.
 Techshot Inc. has earned a NASA contract worth approximately $750,000 to develop a prototype of the Multi-specimen Variable-gravity Platform.
 The contract follows an earlier agreement with NASA for preliminary design work. The device processes biological materials in space through a centrifuge, a piece of laboratory equipment that spins an object or liquid samples at high speed.
 Techshot COO John Vellinger said that once in space, each of the twin centrifuges inside the device can reproduce the gravity of Earth, Mars, the moon or even an asteroid.
 "Every laboratory, including the International Space Station National Laboratory, needs a centrifuge," Vellinger said. "The Multi-specimen Variable-gravity Platform provides researchers with two that can accommodate experiments with cells, plants, insects and even fish.
" Vellinger said studying the effects of gravity on living things provides new insights into areas like disease prevention and treatment.
 "In space, researchers can study fundamental biological processes that sometimes are otherwise masked on Earth because of its natural gravitational pull," he said.
 The first Multi-specimen Variable-gravity Platform prototype is expected to be completed in 18-24 months. Founded in 1988, Techshot
 is a product development company. Besides NASA, its customers include Procter & Gamble, MobileMedTek, Prosolia, Mavizon Technologies and FAST Diagnostics.
 Techshot provides product development solutions to the consumer products, medical, aerospace and defense industries. The Purdue Research Park
 has the largest university-affiliated business incubation program in the country. The park's four Indiana sites are in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.
 The nearly 200 companies located in the park network employ about 4,000 people.

 Never-before-seen plant metabolites discovered
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University researchers have captured evolution in action through the discovery of a new set of metabolites synthesized by 
Arabidopsis plants, according to research findings published this week in the journal Science. Clint Chapple, distinguished professor of biochemistry; former Purdue graduate student Jing-Ke Weng; current Purdue graduate student Yi Li; and Huaping Mo, associate director of the Purdue Interdepartmental NMR Facility, were studying how new metabolic pathways evolve in plants when they discovered the metabolites, which they are calling arabidopyrones.
 Many different metabolites are used by plants for defense, pigmentation and to attract pollinators, while others are used by humans as pharmaceuticals and flavorings.
 Arabidopyrones are found only in Arabidopsis, a common research plant, although it's unclear what the metabolites do. "Understanding plant metabolism is critical to being able to understand how plants evolve and adapt to their environment, and, in an applied sense, having access to the genes involved in plant metabolism helps us manipulate those processes and harness them for our own use," Chapple said.
 Arabidopsis diverged from its common ancestor with related plants such as cabbage and canola about 40 million years ago. Since then, many 
Arabidopsis genes have been duplicated. When that happens, Chapple said, one copy of the gene typically continues to perform its previous function, while the other is free to mutate and acquire new properties and functions.
 One such duplication enabled Arabidopsis to begin making the new compounds Chapple and his group discovered. "This is an example of how nature experiments with chemistry.
 If that new gene becomes useful to the plant because the new compounds help the plant survive in some way or reproduce more effectively, there is selection for the gene and it is maintained," Chapple said.
 The way these compounds are made is reminiscent of how beets make their red pigments. But these compounds are made from the amino acid tyrosine; whereas, arabidopyrones originate instead from phenylalanine, an amino acid plants use to make floral scent compounds, antioxidants and lignin.
 The newly evolved enzyme Chapple's group discovered reroutes some of the material flowing through these pathways and channels it toward other enzymes that complete the transformation to arabidopyrones.
 ABSTRACT Plants possess arrays of functionally diverse specialized metabolites, many of which are distributed taxonomically. Here, we describe the evolution of a class of substituted a-pyrone metabolites in Arabidopsis, which we have named arabidopyrones.
 The biosynthesis of arabidopyrones requires a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP84A4) to generate the catechol-substituted substrate for an extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase (AtLigB).
 Unlike other ring-cleavage-derived plant metabolites made from tyrosine, arabidopyrones are instead derived from phenylalanine through the early steps of phenylpropanoid metabolism.
 Whereas CYP84A4, an Arabidopsis-specific paralog of the lignin-biosynthetic enzyme CYP84A1, has neofunctionalized relative to its ancestor, AtLigB homologs are widespread among land plants and many bacteria.
 This study exemplifies the rapid evolution of a biochemical pathway formed by the addition of a new biological activity into an existing metabolic infrastructure.

 New buoy offers real-time Lake Michigan data in Indiana
 A new buoy four miles off the coast of Michigan City, Ind., in Lake Michigan will provide real-time information on lake conditions for boaters and others just off the shore.
 (Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant photo/Anjanette Riley.)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Boaters and beach-goers visiting the Indiana shoreline of Lake Michigan now can learn current conditions such as water temperature, wind speeds and other information provided by a new environmental sensing buoy.
 Placed four miles off the coast of Michigan City on Sept. 4, the buoy is the first of its kind in the Indiana waters of Lake Michigan.
 The buoy, jointly owned and operated by Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant and the Purdue University Department of Civil Engineering, will advance the understanding of near-shore waters, alert the public to hazardous conditions, protect water quality and improve weather forecasts.
 From about April 1 to Nov. 1 each year, the TIDAS 900 buoy will relay real-time information on wind speed, air and water temperature, wave height and direction, and other environmental characteristics.
 "This is an understudied area of Lake Michigan," said Cary Troy, a Purdue engineer and principal investigator for the project. "It is an important improvement to now have coverage on this part of the lake where before we did not.
" The buoy is important because conditions in the lake's center are much different from conditions closer to shore, said John Taylor, a National Weather Service meteorologist with the northern Indiana office.
 "There are not many observations out on the lake itself, and for a long time we only had a single buoy that was 50 miles north of Michigan City," Taylor said.
 "The more information we have for near-shore areas the better." Snapshots of lake conditions updated in 10-minute increments are available to swimmers, boaters and anglers on the Sea Grant website at 
http://www.iiseagrant.org/buoy. The site highlights conditions of particular interest to the lake's recreational users, such as wave height, wind speed and surface water temperature.
 A webcam provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory will allow site visitors to see the area surrounding the buoy in real-time.
 Graphs showing trends over 24 hours help the buoy be a day-to-day tool for communities that rely on Lake Michigan for food, drinking water and recreation.
 "This site allows people to easily access information and better understand the impact real-time data collection has on near-shore research and recreation," said Carolyn Foley, assistant research coordinator for Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant, based out of the Purdue University Department of Forestry and Natural Resources.
 "Over the years, we plan to include additional tools and applications that could be used to teach people about near-shore ecology.
 We're working with stakeholders to ensure that what we develop is useful in terms of what data we collect and display and how we choose to display it.
" Information collected from the buoy also will be fed into the National Data Buoy Center operated by NOAA. The Michigan City buoy contributes to a worldwide network of buoys and coastal stations, all designed to observe and track marine environmental characteristics.
 Data from the buoy will be used by forecasters at National Weather Service offices in northern Indiana and Chicago, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and researchers at Purdue to improve predictions of hazardous weather, help the fishing community better target particular species throughout the season and learn more about circulation patterns that affect Lake Michigan's biological activity.
 With real-time monitoring, researchers will be able to adapt weather, water quality and ecosystem models to the constantly changing lake conditions.
 The Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant College Program is one of 30 National Sea Grant College Programs. Created by Congress in 1966, Sea Grant combines university, government, business and industry expertise to address coastal and Great Lakes' needs.
 Funding is provided by NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce, the University of Illinois and Purdue University.

 New CFO and CAFO rules require operational changes
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana's new regulations aimed at keeping confined animal feeding operations environmentally friendly will require producers to change record-keeping and manure management practices, effective Sunday (July 1).
 Last fall, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management approved revised rules that altered the environmental management requirements of confined feeding operations, called CFOs, and concentrated animal feeding operations, known as CAFOs.
 Indiana defines a CFO as "any animal feeding operation engaged in the confined feeding of at least 300 cattle, 500 horses, 600 swine or sheep, or 30,000 fowl, such as chickens, turkeys or other poultry.
" All CAFOs are classified as CFOs, but CAFOs house more animals and have previously had more stringent regulations and permit application procedures.
 Under the new rules, CAFOs have the option to continue to have CAFO permits or assume general CFO permit status, said Purdue Extension nutrient management specialist Tamilee Nennich.
 Operations that would like to maintain their CAFO permits will need individualized permits approved by IDEM. Operators with individual CAFO permits will be required to create nutrient management plans accessible to the public.
 Additional record-keeping also will be required. For example, farmers will need to keep records of daily inspections. Potentially of greater concern are new rules specific to CFO operators regarding winter manure application and soil phosphorus.
 Under the new regulations, manure application on frozen and snow-covered ground is no longer permitted, Nennich said. There are exceptions for emergency situations.
 Operators can apply for special permits that allow for winter application if a farm was previously permitted with less than 120 days of manure storage.
 The new CFO rules also require that farmers apply manure to their fields on the basis of the soil's phosphorus content. Previously, manure was applied to fields based on soil nitrogen content and nitrogen needs for the coming crop.
 New regulations require that soil phosphorus not exceed 200 parts per million by 2018. That means that over the next six years, farmers will need to continue to monitor soil phosphorus concentrations and work to begin the very gradual process of reducing the phosphorus content of their fields.
 When the new rules go into effect on July 1, CFOs cannot apply manure to soil with phosphorus levels higher than 400 parts per million.
 Nennich said the potential risk of water pollution is one of the biggest concerns pertaining to high phosphorus levels in soils.
 While she believes the concern is justified, she said the new rules fail to account for the variance between fields. The risk of phosphorus water pollution is not the same for every farm.
 "It's going to remove some acreage people have been using for manure application and increase the cost for manure removal and application," Nennich said.
 Nennich said producers need to make sure they understand what the new rules mean for their individual operations. She encouraged producers to plan ahead for the winter and keep records to show compliance with the regulations.
 "We really encourage producers to go through and make sure they understand the changes in their permits and work hard to make sure they are protecting the environment with their operations," she said.
 More information about the impending rule changes is available on the IDEM website at http://www.in.gov/idem

 These shapes were produced with Handy-Potter, a new design tool developed at the C Design Lab in Purdue's School of Mechanical Engineering, that enables people to create and modify three-dimensional objects with their bare hands.

Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Researchers have developed a design tool that enables people to create three-dimensional objects with their bare hands by using a depth-sensing camera and advanced software algorithms to interpret hand movements and gestures.
 "It allows people to express their ideas rapidly and quickly using hand motions alone," said Karthik Ramani, Purdue University's Donald W.
 Feddersen Professor of Mechanical Engineering. "We're democratizing the design process. You don't have to be an engineer or an accomplished potter to use this.
 You can be a kid." The tool, called Handy-Potter, represents a potentially significant advance in how people interact with computers, he said.
 "In our lab we have a saying, 'The mouse is dead,'" Ramani said. "With Handy-Potter, we are trying to make the computer interface natural to the user.
" His research team won an "all conference best paper" award for the Handy-Potter work, to be presented during the ASME 2012 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference this week in Chicago.
 The paper was co-authored by Ramani and graduate students Vinayak, Sundar Murugappan and Cecil Piya. The research, funded by the National Science Foundation, addresses the limitations of conventional computer-aided design tools that are needed to create geometric shapes.
 Purdue doctoral student Vinayak uses Handy-Potter to create a three-dimensional object. He is represented by a stick figure as he modifies the shape.
 (Purdue University image) "Traditional tools require the use of procedures so complicated that it is difficult to become an expert," Ramani said.
 "Handy-Potter is more of an imagination tool. You create the shape while you are completely focused on the idea rather than bothering yourself about the right usage of the tool.
 The tool learns you and does not become a barrier in creation. You don't learn the tool." Users interact with a computer using natural user interfaces like hand gestures to create and modify shapes.
 "For example, there are very intuitive gestures for pulling and bending a shape," Ramani said. "You learn the gestures naturally and without any user manual.
" The tool could have applications in areas including games, architecture, art and engineering design. It uses the Microsoft Kinect camera, which senses three-dimensional space.
 The camera is found in consumer electronics games that can track a person's body without using handheld electronics. Researchers created advanced algorithms that recognize the hand, understand that the hand is interacting with the shape and then modify the shape in response to the hand interaction.
 (A video showing how the system works is available at https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/?p=1221) "The algorithms are very intelligent," Ramani said.
 "They represent state-of-the-art synthesis of machine learning, geometric modeling and human-computer interaction." Note to Journalists

venere@purdue.edu ABSTRACT We present the paradigm of natural and exploratory shape modeling by introducing novel 3-D interactions for creating, modifying and manipulating 3-D shapes using arms and hands.
 Though current design tools provide complex modeling functionality, they remain non-intuitive and require significant training since they segregate 3-D shapes into hierarchical 2-D inputs, thus binding the user to stringent procedural steps and making modifications cumbersome.
 In addition, the designer knows what to design when they go to CAD systems and the creative exploration in design is lost. We present a shape creation paradigm as an exploration of creative imagination and externalization of shapes, particularly in the early phases of design.
 We integrate the capability of humans to express 3-D shapes via hand-arm motions with traditional sweep surface representation to demonstrate rapid exploration of a rich variety of fairly complex 3-D shapes.
 We track the skeleton of users using the depth data provided by low-cost depth sensing camera (Kinect). Our modeling tool is configurable to provide a variety of implicit constraints for shape symmetry and resolution based on the position, orientation and speed of the arms.
 Intuitive strategies for coarse and fine shape modifications are also proposed. We conclusively demonstrate the creation of a wide variety of product concepts and show an average modeling time of only a few seconds while retaining the intuitiveness of communicating the design intent.

 New hire to help students with off-campus housing 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - University Residences and Purdue's dean of students have teamed up to create a new position to help students navigate the world of off-campus housing.
 Ashley Darnell, who previously worked in a similar capacity at the University of Pennsylvania, started Jan. 3 as Purdue's new assistant director of off-campus student services.
 Darnell's job is to help students make informed decisions when deciding between on- and off-campus housing and to help them understand the often-complicated process of securing the latter, said Bob Heitert, director of administration for University Residences.
 The idea to create the position arose last year when it became apparent that more freshmen would be living off campus because the class size was larger than normal, Heitert said.
 Also, Barbara Frazee, director of University Residences, and Danita Brown, dean of students, wanted to provide students living off-campus with more resources.
 "The creation of this position was aimed at students living off campus in general, but there also were some very specific groups we all agreed needed attention, including international students," Heitert said.
 "Also, in University Residences we house about 90 percent of the incoming student class. We felt the other 10 percent needed a resource to help with housing, too.
" Before coming to Purdue, Darnell most recently worked for five years as the coordinator of off-campus services at the University of Pennsylvania.
 Before that, he worked as a residence coordinator at Florida State University and as a community director at George Washington University.
 This month, Darnell will begin coordinating residence hall programming at Purdue. It will offer students information, including the pros and cons of off-campus and on-campus housing, how to go about securing off-campus housing, and how to approach landlord-tenant issues.
 In addition to helping students feel more comfortable with the off-campus housing process, Darnell's work will help support the students' academics, he said.
 "If we can assist them so that they're not having issues with housing - on campus or off - certainly there's a benefit because it allows them to focus on their academics," Darnell said.

 New Krannert program aimed at helping undergrads launch careers
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University's Krannert School of Management has begun a program to ensure that its undergraduates leave school with not only a degree but skills that will provide the foundation for starting a career while striving for a personal and professional life built on high ethical standards, community service and social responsibility.
 This fall, all of Krannert's incoming freshmen are participating in Launching Business Leaders, an initiative designed to develop skills and competencies that reach beyond academics that they'll need in their careers and personal lives.
 "In this program, students develop a personal brand," said Charlene Sullivan, associate dean for undergraduate programs and associate professor of management.
 "Throughout their undergraduate years, they'll learn skills and participate in activities that will produce well-rounded young professionals with experiential-based learning that goes beyond that gained in the classroom.
" Specifically, the students will build their personal portfolios with work, leadership, academic, project and global experiences.
 An eight-week class that had been used to introduce freshmen to the options within Krannert and at Purdue has been expanded with Launching Business Leaders to put students on the path to building their portfolio.
 The Launching Business Leaders message continues in a second eight-week class that focuses on information literacy, including written and oral communication and research.
 Finally, in their junior year, all Krannert students will enroll in an upper-level 16-week course that focuses on personal portfolio assessment, résumé building, interviewing skills and professional behavior and etiquette.
 The students will use Passport, a tool designed at Purdue by ITaP, which can then be attached to their LinkedIn site. "Through these courses, our students will work on various components of professional and personal success, including critical thinking, oral communication, global awareness and networking skills to name a few," Sullivan said.
 "They'll learn to think and analyze and will leave Purdue with the leadership skills necessary to tackle the toughest challenges.
 "They'll also work to develop their personal brand that includes trustworthiness and integrity, professionalism, personal responsibility and a drive for results.
" Krannert graduates are highly sought after by job recruiters who ranked Krannert third in a 2012 Bloomberg Businessweek survey of undergraduate business schools.
 "Why shouldn't our students be No. 1?" asked Sullivan, who said Krannert's new challenge will be to increase the number of community, company, state, local and world leaders who it graduates.
 "We have world-class academic programs at Purdue. We get wonderfully talented students. Now we have the Launching Business Leaders program designed to work on the 'whole person' and allow our tremendous resources to have an impact on a broad range of challenges in the world," she said.

 New microtweezers may build tiny 'MEMS' structures
 Purdue researchers have created a new type of microtweezers capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures, print coatings to make advanced sensors, and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research.
 (Birck Nanotechnology Center photo) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Researchers have created new "microtweezers" capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures, print coatings to make advanced sensors, and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research.
 The microtweezers might be used to assemble structures in microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, which contain tiny moving parts.
 MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes currently are being used in commercial products. A wider variety of MEMS devices, however, could be produced through a manufacturing technology that assembles components like microscopic Lego pieces moved individually into place with microtweezers, said Cagri Savran (pronounced Chary Savran), an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University.
 "We've shown how this might be accomplished easily, using new compact and user-friendly microtweezers to assemble polystyrene spheres into three-dimensional shapes," he said.
 Research findings were detailed in a paper that appeared online in December in the Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, or JMEMS.
 The paper was written by Savran, mechanical engineering graduate students Bin-Da Chan and Farrukh Mateen, electrical and computer engineering graduate student Chun-Li Chang, and biomedical engineering doctoral student Kutay Icoz.
 Purdue researchers have created a new type of microtweezers capable of manipulating objects to build tiny structures, print coatings to make advanced sensors, and grab and position live stem cell spheres for research.
 (Birck Nanotechnology Center photo) The new tool contains three main parts: a thimble knob from a standard micrometer, a two-pronged tweezer made from silicon, and a "graphite interface," which converts the turning motion of the thimble knob into a pulling-and-pushing action to open and close the tweezer prongs.
 No electrical power sources are needed, increasing the potential for practical applications. Other types of microtweezers have been developed and are being used in research.
 However, the new design is simpler both to manufacture and operate, Savran said. The design contains a one-piece "compliant structure," which is springy like a bobby pin or a paperclip.
 Most other microtweezers require features such as hinges or components that move through heat, magnetism or electricity, complex designs that are expensive to manufacture and relatively difficult to operate in various media, he said.
 The tweezers make it feasible to precisely isolate individual stem cell spheres from culture media and to position them elsewhere.
 Currently, these spheres are analyzed in large groups, but microtweezers could provide an easy way to study them by individually selecting and placing them onto analytical devices and sensors.
 "We currently are working to weigh single micro particles, individually selected among many others, which is important because precise measurements of an object's mass reveal key traits, making it possible to identify composition and other characteristics," Savran said.
 "This will now be as easy as selecting and weighing a single melon out of many melons in a supermarket." That work is a collaboration with the research group of Timothy Ratliff, the Robert Wallace Miller Director of Purdue's Center for Cancer Research.
 The microtweezers also could facilitate the precision printing of chemical or protein dots onto "microcantilevers," strips of silicon that resemble tiny diving boards.
 The microcantilevers can be "functionalized," or coated with certain chemicals or proteins that attract specific molecules and materials.
 Because they vibrate at different frequencies depending on what sticks to the surface, they are used to detect chemicals in the air and water.
 Generally, microcantilevers are functionalized to detect one type of substance by exposing them to fluids, Savran said. However, being able to microprint a sequence of precisely placed dots of different chemicals on each cantilever could make it possible to functionalize a device to detect several substances at once.
 Such a sensing technology also would require a smaller sample size than conventional diagnostic technologies, making it especially practical.
 The new microtweezers are designed to be attached easily to "translation stages" currently used in research. These stages are essentially platforms on which to mount specimens for viewing and manipulating.
 Unlike most other microtweezers, the new device is highly compact and portable and can be easily detached from a platform and brought to another lab while still holding a micro-size object for study, Savran said.
 The two-pronged tweezer is micromachined in a laboratory called a "clean room" with the same techniques used to create microcircuits and computer chips.
 The research was based at the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue's Discovery Park. Note to Journalists: An electronic copy of the paper is available from Emil Venere, Purdue News Service, at 765-494-4709, 
venere@purdue.edu This letter reports a compact, versatile, and user-friendly micromanipulator that uses an elastically deformable silicon microtweezer to grab microentities and a micrometer head for rotational manual actuation.
 The micro-/macroconnection is achieved via a graphite interface that results in a compact and portable design and placement on most translation stages.
 The system, which can operate in both air and liquid and transport objects between the two media, has a wide range of applications.
 We demonstrate but a few of them, including in situ construction of microstructures in 3-D, isolation and placement of individual microparticles on designated spots on sensors, on-demand microcontact printing of microparticles, and manipulation of live stem cell spheres.

 New Purdue-developed mobile app helps identify tropical plants of Costa Rica, could be used to create other note-taking apps
 New Purdue-developed mobile app helps identify tropical plants of Costa Rica, could be used to create other note-taking apps This screenshot taken from the Green Notes app provides an image and description of the African oil palm, which is found in Costa Rica.
 (Purdue News Service photo)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Some pictures may be worth a thousand words, but when it comes to plant identification, a snapshot rarely tells the full story.
 Purdue agronomist Lori Unruh Snyder is well aware of the spatial and informational limitations of printed materials. Unruh Snyder, an assistant professor, realized the true limitations of photo sharing when publishing a field guide to tropical plants.
 The pocket-sized book was perfect for field use, but many of the supplemental photos and more detailed plant descriptions she'd collected through years of research had to be sacrificed for portability.
 She couldn't find a good digital guide either, so she decided to make her own mobile application, and she wanted some help. Unruh Snyder partnered with 
ITaP technology consultants to create Green Notes, a mobile app that will help students, tourists, and plant enthusiasts search for and take notes about plants they see.
 While Green Notes is specific to plants, it's built on a platform that can be used to create other photographic note-taking applications in various fields for faculty who are interested in partnering with ITaP.
 In addition to providing a digital, searchable plant library, Green Notes allows users to contribute to the resource by capturing plant images and sending them to their personal email or to their desired instructor.
 The app also contains useful information about the foods in the country to help individuals identify risks and benefits of eating certain plants.
 The app was named Green Notes because it represents a new way to digitally catolog plants and keep notes in a paperless, environmentally friendly way.
 Other key Green Notes functionalities include auto-geotagging of plant locations and a full listing of plant sub-properties, such as medicinal or holistic uses.
 The app retails on iTunes for $3.99 - a fraction of the cost of most plant identification textbooks - and is easily portable, unlike a heavy textbook.
 The app currently lists 95 plants with 260 high-quality color images and is increasing in size. "What we're really trying to do is educate the general public on the plants in Costa Rica and their uses, as eco-tourism is a huge part of the country," Unruh Snyder says.
 "The application will be very important for tour guides and will help them explain plants to their clients, why the plants are seen where they are in the country, and what they are used for.
" To collect data and provide the most relevant and up-to-date content, Unruh Snyder frequently travels to Costa Rica. She also shares her passion for the country by leading study abroad excursions on sustainable agriculture food systems.
 "Many people don't know, for example, that pineapples grow as a ground-dwelling herbaceous fruit and not on a tree, that avocados contain a substance that can prevent hair from turning gray, or that cashews have been used to treat fever and sweeten breath," Unruh Snyder says.
 "The app is not only a wonderful educational resource, but it benefits students, in particular, by giving them more confidence in their skills to understand and communicate about the plants around them when they're participating in our study abroad trips.
 My students and I used the Green Notes app on a daily basis when we visited Costa Rica this past May." Having previously partnered with ITaP on the creation of iFARM, an interactive, multimedia simulation of agricultural learning modules, Unruh Snyder is a proponent of adopting new technologies into her curriculum to boost student interaction, which she believes benefits learning.
 "In many cases, a single snapshot of a tree, vine or flower looks nothing like the plant in its natural environement, so it often stumps my students when they attempt to identify a specimen in the field," she says.
 "For students who don't speak Spanish, Green Notes also bridges the communication gap by enabling them to communicate through images, and provides the common Spanish name of which it is called in Costa Rica.
 With this technology you can zoom in on a photo to see additional morphological details that are helpful when identifying the plant.
" Moreover, Unruh Snyder has the ability to update the app with new information as it becomes available, which costs less and is faster than updating a book.
 The platform also may be expanded to incorporate plants from other regions, and the technology can be applied to field guide material from other faculty.
 Kyle Bowen, ITaP's director of informatics, who worked with Unruh Snyder to create Green Notes, encourages faculty to contact him to discuss additional opportunities in bringing mobility and interactivity to the classroom.
 While several ITaP-developed mobile applications already are available for broad use, Bowen and his team are interested in working with instructors to develop new teaching technologies.
 "We want to partner with instructors in creating new tools that enhance the learning and teaching experience, both within and outside of the classroom.
" Bowen says. "Our students live in a mobile world. We can accommodate them by employing technology that students already own and understand, while reducing the cost of educational materials and improving student engagement and access to information.

 New Purdue efforts focus on Brazil
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University's Global Engineering Program has launched an initiative to form collaborations with academia and industry in Brazil.
The initiative included three study abroad courses this summer oriented toward engineering students in addition to two other classes offered in agriculture, and language and culture.
"More than 50 Purdue students and eight faculty visited Brazil this summer," said William Anderson, director of the Global Engineering Program.
 "This is an important step toward forging our partnerships there."Central to the initiative was a study abroad course involving 26 students who delved into issues including alternative energy production, transportation infrastructure, ecology and the environment.
 The course was developed by Monica Prezzi and Rodrigo Salgado, both professors of civil engineering."The program was very comprehensive, in terms of technical content," Prezzi said.
 "We had university, academic and industrial hosts."Such study abroad efforts benefit the students as well as the local and Purdue communities, Salgado said.
"Any time you can establish or strengthen ties with the fifth-largest economy in the world, you are going to realize benefits," he said.
 "It's beneficial for Purdue students and faculty and for local businesses to interact with this dynamic economy and for our students to be able to work there, whether permanently or temporarily.
 At the same time, Brazil sends thousands of students abroad with full scholarships every year, and Purdue should make an effort to attract these students.
"The Purdue students visited the Itaipu Dam and its bio sanctuary, created to mitigate the impacts of construction on wildlife and the environment, near the border with Argentina and Paraguay; the Santa Cruz Ethanol Plant near Sao Carlos; an airline aircraft maintenance facility in Sao Carlos; the University of Sao Paulo at Sao Carlos; a new subway line construction site in the city of Sao Paulo; a port construction site in the state of Rio de Janeiro; the Port of Acu "superport complex" under construction in Campos; the Petrobras research center in Rio de Janeiro; and the graduate program of COPPE-UFRJ, a university in Rio de Janeiro.
"Brazil is a country of important significance in the world, and its stature and prominence will only continue to grow both politically and economically," said Michael A.
 Brzezinski, dean of international programs. "Purdue is actively engaging the country through faculty research and now, thanks to the College of Engineering, via student learning opportunities as well.
"Melba Crawford, interim head of the School of Civil Engineering and associate dean of Engineering for Research, said all three courses are in areas of strategic interest to the College of Engineering.
 "The interdisciplinary course led by Prezzi and Salgado provided the type of opportunity we strongly endorse for our students to experience multiple aspects of the profession," she said.
One of the other engineering-oriented study abroad courses, led by Lia Stanciu, an associate professor of materials engineering, focused on the use of biosensors for environmental monitoring in the rainforest.
 The other course, led by Anderson, focused on the use of "remote sensing" from satellites and aircraft to study global climate change and the rainforest.
 "The major technical theme of this program was the role of the rainforest in global climatology and how remote sensing is being used to monitor its health," Anderson said.
 Other topics included forest ecology, land use change, and the role of indigenous peoples in conservation efforts. After a series of lectures and visits with academic researchers and to the Brazilian space agency INPE, the students spent four days in Amazonia for firsthand observations.
Inez Hua, a civil engineering professor and Global Engineering Program associate director for Latin America, is leading a College of Engineering initiative to develop research and education collaborations in Brazil.
 Hua and Nicholas Carpita, a professor in the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, led a Purdue delegation to universities, industry, and government agencies in Sao Paulo state.
 "Our meetings were very productive, and I'm confident that we'll develop long-term collaborations with our university and corporate partners in Brazil," Hua said.
Prezzi and Salgado, who are Brazilian, began developing their study-abroad course two years ago, and the other two courses were added later.
"This is something that's natural for us," Prezzi said. "Being from Brazil, we have a network of connections there. We know the geography and the language, we know how institutions and government agencies work, we know the university system.
 This familiarity enables you to provide the best experience possible for the students."Of the 26 undergraduate students in the Brazilian course, 12 were women.
"This is unusual because engineering courses typically have lower percentages of female students," Salgado said. "Even more interesting is the fact that we have students from a broad representation of engineering disciplines, including chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, and aeronautics and astronautics.
 There are many opportunities for jobs in a broad range of industries in Brazil, and there is a well-developed university system.
 Our students need to better understand how business and institutions work there. This program will help them to establish interactions with other students, professors and private industry in Brazil.

 New Purdue Research Park-based firm helps surgeons see cancer cells
 On Target Laboratories LLC is developing probes to illuminate cancer cells, which may help surgeons see more of them during surgery.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Surgeons may benefit from technology developed to target cancer cells one-thousandth of a millimeter in size and make them easier to see during surgery.
 On Target Laboratories LLC is developing probes to illuminate cancer cells. The technology is licensed from Endocyte Inc., and was discovered by Philip S.
 Low, the Ralph C. Corley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Purdue University.On Target Laboratories is based in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette.
 Tom Hurvis is chairman of the board, Marty Low is CEO, Philip Low is CSO and Tim Biro is COO."For our first probe, EC-17, we attach a dye to folate, which is a water-soluble vitamin," Marty Low said.
 "Folate binds to the receptors on the surface of the cancer cell and then enters the cell with the fluorescent dye through a process called endocytosis.
 It will not enter healthy cells, which do not have folate receptors."Low said the probes facilitate work done by surgeons by helping them see more cancer cells.
"The targeted dye will literally act as a lighted road map so surgeons can identify smaller lesions, margins and lymph nodes that are cancerous," he said.
 "We believe that if surgeons can see more, they will be able to remove more and the outcome for patients will be better. It also may reduce costs by potentially saving time in the operating room, recovery time and the need for additional procedures.
"EC-17 will initially be used to help ovarian cancer patients, but surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania and Indiana University are conducting studies to determine the potential use of EC-17 in lung and renal cancer patients.
 On Target Laboratories is in the process of developing other probes for additional cancers including colon, breast, endometrial and prostate.
 Because different cancer cells have different receptors, there will be different targeting drugs and dyes to create the probes. EC-17 will enter Phase II clinical trials in late summer 2012.
Marty Low explained how On Target Laboratories benefits by being a tenant in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette."The proximity to Purdue University and the core technology is a huge benefit," he said.
 "The Purdue Research Foundation provides services that will help us grow, and the park is an environment where innovative people come together.
"About On Target Laboratories LLCOn Target Laboratories is in the business of discovering, developing and commercializing small molecules that, when conjugated with fluorescent dyes, target and illuminate specific cancerous cells.
 These conjugates can be used by doctors and surgeons worldwide to better diagnose and surgically remove a wide range of diseases from cancer to inflammation-related diseases.
 On Target and its partners will succeed by helping doctors dramatically change the outcome for their patients.About Purdue Research Park
The Purdue Research Park has the largest university-affiliated business incubation program in the country. The park's four Indiana sites are in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.
 The nearly 200 companies located in the park network employ about 4,000 people.

 New Purdue Research Park tenant to roll out technology at Detroit conference
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A software and technology consulting firm founded by a father and son team of Purdue alumni will roll out a new product Tuesday (June 5) at an industry conference in Detroit.
 OdditSoft LLC officials will launch 20/20 Envision during a presentation titled "The Cloud is Your Friend" for the Independent Association of Accredited Registrars.
 The company was founded by CEO Jason Blom and his father, Wayne Blom, who is the COO. Jason Blom said registrars, also known as certification bodies, face efficiency issues due to evolving industry trends.
 "20/20 Envision was developed to improve operational efficiency for these certification bodies, which leads to improved results not only for their own bottom line but their clients as well," he said.
 "The software is cloud-based, secure, utilizes Google technologies and is intuitive to use. It also can be customized by the end user if the organization faces special requirements.
" Blom said OdditSoft became a tenant of the Purdue Research Park because the founders and key personnel have strong ties to Purdue and they wanted to leverage the services the park provides.
 The Bloms are Purdue alumni. CMO Jeff Goecker is a communication specialist at Purdue's Birck Nanotechnology Center and also is a Purdue graduate.
 Pat Heck, director of development with Lieberman Technologies, and Tim Korb, assistant head of Purdue's Department of Computer Science, are members of the firm's advisory board.
 "Purdue is acknowledged as one of the leading research universities in the world, and the Purdue Research Park has a reputation as an outstanding place to develop new and established companies," Blom said.
 "My colleagues and I know we can grow our company through the professional contacts we make with park officials and park-based companies, and the amenities that are offered allow us to focus on our customers and ongoing product development.
" The Bloms have written into OdditSoft's operating agreement that the company will donate 10 percent of its gross profits to a charity, the MWGA Foundation.
 "The foundation is a charitable organization that develops personal finance curriculum for high school and collegiate classes. These courses are aimed at adequately preparing youth to succeed in the real world," Blom said.
 "It would be our hope that these courses be a mandatory requisite for graduation. The foundation hopes to provide scholarships to deserving individuals for college in the near future.
" OdditSoft LLC is a software and consulting firm based in the Kurz Purdue Technology Center in West Lafayette, Ind. It was founded in 2011 by father and son duo, Wayne and Jason Blom.
 The firm was set up to initially serve the registrar/certification body industry. Utilizing Google technologies and proprietary software, the company has built its flagship product, 20/20 Envision, which it is proud to launch in June.
 The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The parks are home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.

 New 'self-calibrating MEMS' bringing accuracy to nanotech
 This picture shows a new device called a self-calibratable MEMS. Purdue researchers have demonstrated the tiny machines, which could make possible super-accurate sensors and motors with far-reaching applications.
 (Purdue University Birck Nanotechnology Center image/Jason Vaughn Clark)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Researchers have demonstrated tiny machines that could make possible super-accurate sensors and motors, with far-reaching applications from computer storage to altimeters, detecting petroleum deposits to measuring DNA-binding forces.
 The machines are called self-calibratable micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. Although MEMS are in commercial use, the new device is the first of its kind capable of self-calibration, a step critical for applications requiring high performance and accuracy, said 
Jason Vaughn Clark, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and mechanical engineering at Purdue University.
 "Self-calibration is needed because each MEMS device is slightly different due to variations that occur in manufacturing," he said.
 "Small variations in microstructure geometry, stiffness, and mass can significantly affect performance. Because of this variability, no two MEMS behave identically.
 Since conventional methods to measure MEMS properties are usually impractical, expensive, have unknown accuracy and large uncertainty, enabling MEMS to calibrate themselves is a game-changing innovation.
" Clark previously developed the self-calibration theory. He and doctoral student Fengyuan Li have now created the device and conducted experiments to validate the theory.
 Findings are detailed in a paper to appear later this year in the IEEE Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, or JMEMS. The peer-reviewed work received a grade of A for "innovation" and an A for "importance to the field," which testifies to the significance of the research, Clark said.
 "I think it's important to note that in 1990 MEMS pioneer Richard Muller said research on the mechanical properties of the materials in these devices is needed to provide the engineering base that will make it possible to exploit fully this technology," he said.
 "And during a 2007 visit to Purdue, physics Nobel laureate John Hall said that without accurate and precise measurements, no reliable form of science or engineering is possible.
" The self-calibrating technology makes it possible to accurately measure displacement, or how far a measuring device moves, on a scale of micrometers to less than a nanometer - a range that spans a fraction of the diameter of a human hair to a fraction of the width of an atom.
 "The difficulty in accurately measuring small displacements represents a bottleneck in MEMS and nanotech advancements," Clark said.
 "Accurate metrology is a problem that has eluded researchers since the beginning of MEMS and nanotech in the late 1980s. Displacement is fundamental to science and engineering.
 We know that quantities like velocity, acceleration, force, stiffness, frequency, and mass can be related to displacement. Now, using a $15 chip that can fit on your fingertip, we showed that our technology is able to measure MEMS displacements better than a $500,000 electron microscope.
" Introducing accurate measurement methods made the difference between alchemy and chemistry about 230 years ago, and self-calibrating MEMS might bring a similar transformation in the world if nanotechnology, he said.
 "The ability to perform accurate measurements is of paramount importance to technological advancement," he said. "In the late 1700s, Antoine Lavoisier transformed alchemy to chemistry by introducing quantitative measurements.
 Today, some compare the state of micro and nanotechnology to alchemy, where nanotechnologists can precisely sense small signals, but they have not had a practical way to accurately measure most mechanical quantities.
 That is, no two nanotechnology labs have been able to show that they can measure the same phenomenon and obtain the same numerical result.
" The heart of the self-calibrating MEMS are two gaps of differing size, electrostatic sensors and tiny actuators called comb drives, so named because they contain meshing comb-like fingers.
 These meshing fingers are drawn toward each other when a voltage is applied and return to their original position when the voltage is turned off.
 The comb drives measure the change in an electrical property called capacitance while gauging the distances of the two gaps built into the device.
 The fine measurements reveal the difference between the device's designed layout and the actual dimensions. "Once you learn the difference between layout and fabrication, you have calibrated the device," Clark said.
 "Many MEMS designs with comb drives can be easily modified to implement our technology. Our research results suggest the days of inaccurate micro and nano-mechanical measurements are numbered.
" MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes currently are being used commercially in products such as the Nintendo Wii video game, iPhone, automobiles, the Segway human transporter and walking robots.
 However, those MEMS don't require ultrahigh accuracy like those used in tactical- and navigation-grade inertial sensors, which must undergo a complex calibration procedure in the factory.
 The chips are tested using machines that translate, rotate, shock, and heat the devices. "The new self-calibratable MEMS could eliminate or reduce the need for rigorous factory calibration, cutting manufacturing costs," Clark said.
 "Something like 30 percent of manufacturing costs are related to calibration." The self-calibratable MEMS could lead to high-performance data storage technologies and advanced lithography to create next generation computer circuits and nanodevices.
 Researchers will use the new self-calibration approach to improve the accuracy of atomic force microscopes, or AFMs, which are tools essential for nanotechnologists.
 Purdue operates about 30 AFMs, and Clark's research group will use the calibrated MEMS to calibrate AFM displacement, stiffness, and force.
 The group also will use a calibrated MEMS to measure the difference in gravity between different heights above the ground. The ability to measure gravity with such sensitivity could be used as a new tool for detecting underground petroleum deposits.
 "Conventional gravity meters can cost over $200,000," Clark said. "They consist of a large vacuum tube and a mirrored mass. Gravitational acceleration is determined by measuring the drop time of the mass in free fall.
 Since oil or mineral deposits have a different density than surrounding material, the local gravity is slightly different." The bulky and expensive gravity meters could be replaced with a small and inexpensive MEMS chip.
 Another potential application is as an altimeter for aircraft. Conventional altimeters measure height by using air pressure, which fluctuates.
 "These altimeters aren't really accurate," Clark said. "Having a sensor that could accurately determine height would be an asset while flying at night, through fog, or bad weather.
 The self-calibratable technology also could allow MEMS to recalibrate themselves after being exposed to harsh temperature changes or remaining dormant for long periods.
 Yet another potential application is the study of exotic phenomena such as forces between molecules and within tiny structures on the scale of nanometers.
 "A more accurate MEMS device could make it possible to measure physical phenomena that have been beyond the resolution of conventional technology," Clark said.
 "To fully understand and exploit the attributes of the nanoscale, you really have to be able to accurately measure subtle phenomena.
 Without accurate measurement tools, it becomes difficult to discover or resolve these phenomena, to develop accurate physical models, and to subsequently use the models to explore possibilities leading to useful innovations.
" The work is based at the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue's Discovery Park. The research is funded by the National Science Foundation.

venere@purdue.edu We present a practical method for measuring planar gaps of MEMS with comb drives by on-chip or off-chip electrical probing.
 We show that our method is practical, accurate, precise, and repeatable. The option of on-chip, postpackaged electrical measurement enables MEMS to be autonomously self-calibratable.
 We use the measurement of gap to determine the geometrical difference between layout and fabrication, which can lead to measurements of other properties such as displacement, force, stiffness, mass, etc.
 Our method consists of applying enough voltage to close two unequal gaps and measuring the resulting changes in capacitances. Many MEMS designs with comb drives can be easily modified to implement our technology.
 Our results are an order better than convention, and suggest means for further improvement.

 New soybean virus found, confirmed in Indiana
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Soybean vein necrosis virus, a new disease in Indiana soybeans, was confirmed earlier this month, a Purdue Extension plant pathologist says.
 A soybean sample exhibiting symptoms of the virus, also known as SVNV, was sent to Purdue's Plant and Pest Diagnostic Laboratory.
 The laboratory sent the plant sample to Agdia Inc. for further testing. Molecular test results confirmed the presence of a tospovirus, or a disease causing cell death, in the sample.
 "SVNV is one of our newer viruses that we've confirmed in soybeans," said Kiersten Wise. "This is the first year that we've confirmed it in Indiana, although we've seen suspect symptoms in the past.
" While the disease doesn't appear to affect yield, it does cause foliar symptoms similar to herbicide injury, including yellowing in or near plant veins and light green patches or mottled green and brown speckled areas associated with veins.
 Leaves will show a blotchier, scorched appearance in shades of orange and yellow. As the season progresses, Wise said the virus could cause tissue death, which can leave a scorched appearance on severely affected plants.
 Since the discovery of SVNV by a University of Arkansas professor in 2008, the virus had been reported in 12 states: Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Kansas, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia.
 "When those insects are feeding on the soybeans, they may be transmitting this virus as well," Wise said. "We suspect that's why we're seeing more symptoms this year, because we've had more thrips damage in soybeans.
" Calling the virus an "oddity," she said farmers are seeing more of it this year than ever before. "It's all across Indiana from the Kentucky border all the way up to the Michigan border.
 And growers are concerned about what these blotches are on their soybeans," Wise said. "We are still learning more about this virus, and we're going to continue to monitor it in the future," Wise said.
 "But at this point in time we wouldn't recommend any changes in production practices." Wise encouraged growers and crop consultants to inspect any still-green soybean plants for symptoms of soybean vein necrosis and email images of possible cases to

 New students begin Purdue experience with orientation program
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Boiler Gold Rush, a student orientation program involving about 5,500 new students, this year features a supplemental program for international students and an induction ceremony for all new students.
 Boiler Gold Rush International (BGRi) began Wednesday (Aug. 8) and runs through Saturday (Aug. 11). It is designed to help new and transferring undergraduate international students adjust and acclimate to university life and also will help transition them into the one-week Boiler Gold Rush (BGR) program that is Aug.
 12-17. During BGRi, students will temporarily live in one residence hall and be assigned student mentors. Time also will be allotted for them to work with the Office of International Students and Scholars.
 The programming will include topics on Purdue resources and aspects of higher education in the United States. The small-group format will help new students build relationships with their mentors and with one another.
 "We're excited about this new program that will help prepare these students to be successful here," said Joe Potts, associate dean of international programs and director of the Office of International Students and Scholars.
 "It will connect them before classes begin to other students and the community. Purdue's large international student body enables the university to create a diverse, enriched learning environment for all students.
 BGRi will help our new international students and strengthen that diversity." BGRi is a joint effort of the Office of International Students and Scholars; Student Access, Transition and Success programs; and University Residences.
 Purdue has the second-largest international student population among U.S. public universities, according to the 2011 Open Door report by the Institute of International Education.
 The institute also reported that international students and their families contributed $20.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2010-11, with Purdue international students and their families contributing more than $219 million to the Indiana economy.
 Boiler Gold Rush begins Saturday (Aug. 11) with student volunteers helping students move into the residence halls. Students spend the week in small teams as they participate in a variety of activities.
 Among those activities is the New Student Induction and BGR opening ceremonies at 8:30 p.m. Sunday (Aug. 12) in Elliott Hall of Music.
 "The deans of the colleges and schools, along with the president and provost, will be at this formal ceremony that is intended to preview commencement," said Daniel Carpenter, associate director of Student Access, Transition and Success Programs.
 "The goal is to acknowledge the beginning of students' experience at Purdue just as commencement formally recognizes the successful completion of their undergraduate career.
" Another twist for this year's BGR is the Boiler Up Rally from 9-11 a.m. Monday in Ross-Ade Stadium. The rain location is Mackey Arena.
 "This expanded program gets students excited about Purdue athletics," Carpenter said. Also new are mock lectures on Thursday, where students can attend one of five 50-minute sessions by the College of Science to find out what it takes to be successful in some of their large lecture courses.
 "With the help of our top student leaders, the new students always enjoy Boiler Gold Rush, but at the same time, every aspect of the program is helping lay a foundation for student success," Carpenter said.
 "Students at Purdue who participate in these programs have higher retention and graduation rates compared to those who do not." 
Carpenter said each of the colleges and schools at Purdue will have new-student welcome programs during BGR. Other activities during the week include a Get Involved Fair and information sessions about academic life, student life and campus resources.
 Students also will learn about campus initiatives such as the Common Reading Program. Current undergraduate students work with Student Access, Transition and Success Programs to plan programming and serve as the student leaders who actually deliver the program.

 New system could predict solar flares, give advance warning
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Researchers may have discovered a new method to predict solar flares more than a day before they occur, providing advance warning to help protect satellites, power grids and astronauts from potentially dangerous radiation.
 The system works by measuring differences in gamma radiation emitted when atoms in radioactive elements "decay," or lose energy.
 This rate of decay is widely believed to be constant, but recent findings challenge that long-accepted rule. The new detection technique is based on a hypothesis that radioactive decay rates are influenced by solar activity, possibly streams of subatomic particles called solar neutrinos.
 This influence can wax and wane due to seasonal changes in the Earth's distance from the sun and also during solar flares, according to the hypothesis, which is supported with data published in a dozen research papers since it was proposed in 2006, said 
Ephraim Fischbach, a Purdue University professor of physics. Fischbach and Jere Jenkins, a nuclear engineer and director of radiation laboratories in the School of Nuclear Engineering, are leading research to study the phenomenon and possibly develop a new warning system.
 Jenkins, monitoring a detector in his lab in 2006, discovered that the decay rate of a radioactive sample changed slightly beginning 39 hours before a large solar flare.
 Since then, researchers have been examining similar variation in decay rates before solar flares, as well as those resulting from Earth's orbit around the sun and changes in solar rotation and activity.
 The new findings appeared online last week in the journal Astroparticle Physics. "It's the first time the same isotope has been used in two different experiments at two different labs, and it showed basically the same effect," Fischbach said.
 The paper was authored by Jenkins and Fischbach; Ohio State University researchers Kevin R. Herminghuysen, Thomas E. Blue, Andrew C.
 Kauffman and Joseph W. Talnagi; U.S. Air Force researcher Daniel Javorsek; Mayo Clinic researcher Daniel W. Mundy; and Stanford University researcher Peter A.
 Sturrock. Data were recorded during routine weekly calibration of an instrument used for radiological safety at Ohio State's research reactor.
 Findings showed a clear annual variation in the decay rate of a radioactive isotope called chlorine 36, with the highest rate in January and February and the lowest rate in July and August, over a period from July 2005 to June 2011.
 The new observations support previous work by Jenkins and Fischbach to develop a method for predicting solar flares. Advance warning could allow satellite and power grid operators to take steps to minimize impact and astronauts to shield themselves from potentially lethal radiation emitted during solar storms.
 The findings agree with data previously collected at the Brookhaven National Laboratory regarding the decay rate of chlorine 36; changes in the decay rate were found to match changes in the Earth-sun distance and Earth's exposure to different parts of the sun itself, Fischbach said.
 Large solar flares may produce a "coronal mass ejection" of highly energetic particles, which can interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, triggering geomagnetic storms that sometimes knock out power.
 The sun's activity is expected to peak over the next year or so as part of an 11-year cycle that could bring strong solar storms.
 Solar storms can be especially devastating if the flare happens to be aimed at the Earth, hitting the planet directly with powerful charged particles.
 A huge solar storm, called the Carrington event, hit the Earth in 1859, a time when the only electrical infrastructure consisted of telegraph lines.
 "There was so much energy from this solar storm that the telegraph wires were seen glowing and the aurora borealis appeared as far south as Cuba," Fischbach said.
 "Because we now have a sophisticated infrastructure of satellites, power grids and all sort of electronic systems, a storm of this magnitude today would be catastrophic.
 Having a day and a half warning could be really helpful in averting the worst damage." Satellites, for example, might be designed so that they could be temporarily shut down and power grids might similarly be safeguarded before the storm arrived.
 "We have repeatedly seen a precursor signal preceding a solar flare," Fischbach said. "We think this has predictive value." The Purdue experimental setup consists of a radioactive source - manganese 54 - and a gamma-radiation detector.
 As the manganese 54 decays, it turns into chromium 54, emitting a gamma ray, which is recorded by the detector to measure the decay rate.
 Research findings show evidence that the phenomenon is influenced by the Earth's distance from the sun; for example, decay rates are different in January and July, when the Earth is closest and farthest from the sun, respectively.
 "When the Earth is farther away, we have fewer solar neutrinos and the decay rate is a little slower," Jenkins said. "When we are closer, there are more neutrinos, and the decay a little faster.
" Neutrinos have the least mass of any known subatomic particle, yet it is plausible that they are somehow affecting the decay rate, he said.
 Physicist Ernest Rutherford, known as the father of nuclear physics, in the 1930s conducted experiments indicating the radioactive decay rate is constant, meaning it cannot be altered by external influences.
 "Since neutrinos have essentially no mass or charge, the idea that they could be interacting with anything is foreign to physics," Jenkins said.
 "So, we are saying something that doesn't interact with anything is changing something that can't be changed. Either neutrinos are affecting decay rate or perhaps an unknown particle is.
" Jenkins discovered the effect by chance in 2006, when he was watching television coverage of astronauts spacewalking at the International Space Station.
 A solar flare had erupted and was thought to possibly pose a threat to the astronauts. He decided to check his equipment and discovered that a change in decay-rate had preceded the solar flare.
 Further research is needed to confirm the findings and to expand the work using more sensitive equipment, he said. Jenkins and Fischbach have previously collaborated with Peter Sturrock, a professor emeritus of applied physics at Stanford University and an expert on the inner workings of the sun, to
 examine data collected at Brookhaven on the decay rate of radioactive isotopes silicon-32 and chlorine-36. The team reported in 2010 in 
Astroparticle Physics that the decay rate for both isotopes varies in a 33-day recurring pattern, which they attribute to the rotation rate of the sun's core.
 The group found evidence of the same annual and 33-day effect in radium-226 data taken at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig, Germany, and those findings were published in 2011.
 They also found an additional 154-day recurring pattern in both the Brookhaven and PTB data, published in 2011, which they believe to be solar related and similar to a known solar effect called a Rieger periodicity.

 Additional experimental evidence is presented in support of the recent hypothesis that a possible solar influence could explain fluctuations observed in the measured decay rates of some isotopes.
 These data were obtained during routine weekly calibrations of an instrument used for radiological safety at the Ohio State University Research Reactor using 
36Cl. The detector system used was based on a Geiger-Müller gas detector, which is a robust detector system with very low susceptibility to environmental changes.
 A clear annual variation is evident in the data, with a maximum relative count rate observed in January/February, and a minimum relative count rate observed in July/August, for seven successive years from July 2005 to June 2011.
 This annual variation is not likely to have arisen from changes in the detector surroundings, as we show here.

 New tool gives structural strength to 3-D printed works
 Bedrich Benes, an associate professor of computer graphics at Purdue University, is working with Advanced Technology Labs of Adobe Inc.
 to develop a computer program that automatically strengthens objects created using 3-D printing. The innovation is needed because the printed fabrications are often fragile and fall apart or lose their shape, as evidenced by some of the failed or misshapen objects on display here.
 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Objects created using 3-D printing have a common flaw: They are fragile and often fall apart or lose their shape.
 "I have an entire zoo of broken 3-D printed objects in my office," said Bedrich Benes, an associate professor of computer graphics at Purdue University.
 "You can go online, create something using a 3-D printer and pay $300, only to find that it isn't strong enough to survive shipping and arrives in more than one piece," said Radomir Mech, senior research manager from Adobe's Advanced Technology Labs.
 The 3-D printers create shapes layer-by-layer out of various materials, including metals and plastic polymers. Whereas industry has used 3-D printing in rapid prototyping for about 15 years, recent innovations have made the technology practical for broader applications, he said.
 "Now 3-D printing is everywhere," Benes said. "Imagine you are a hobbyist and you have a vintage train model. Parts are no longer being manufactured, but their specifications can be downloaded from the Internet and you can generate them using a 3-D printer.
" The recent rise in 3-D printing popularity has been fueled by a boom in computer graphics and a dramatic reduction of the cost of 3-D printers, Benes said.
 Researchers at Purdue and Adobe's Advanced Technology Labs have jointly developed a program that automatically imparts strength to objects before they are printed.
 "It runs a structural analysis, finds the problematic part and then automatically picks one of the three possible solutions," Benes said.
 Findings were detailed in a paper presented during the SIGGRAPH 2012 conference in August. Former Purdue doctoral student Ondrej Stava created the software application, which automatically strengthens objects either by increasing the thickness of key structural elements or by adding struts.
 The tool also uses a third option, reducing the stress on structural elements by hollowing out overweight elements. "We not only make the objects structurally better, but we also make them much more inexpensive," Mech said.
 "We have demonstrated a weight and cost savings of 80 percent." The new tool automatically identifies "grip positions" where a person is likely to grasp the object.
 A "lightweight structural analysis solver" analyzes the object using a mesh-based simulation. It requires less computing power than traditional finite-element modeling tools, which are used in high-precision work such as designing jet engine turbine blades.
 "The 3-D printing doesn't have to be so precise, so we developed our own structural analysis program that doesn't pay significant attention to really high precision," Benes said.
 The paper was authored by Stava, now a computer scientist at Adobe, doctoral student Juraj Vanek; Benes; Mech; and Nathan Carr, a principal scientist at Adobe's Advanced Technology Labs.
 Future research may focus on better understanding how structural strength is influenced by the layered nature of 3-D-printed objects.
 The researchers may also expand their algorithms to include printed models that have moving parts. Note to Journalists: The research paper is available from Emil Venere, 765-494-4709, 
venere@purdue.edu ABSTRACT The use of 3-D printing has rapidly expanded in the past couple of years. It is now possible to produce 3-D-printed objects with exceptionally high fidelity and precision.
 However, although the quality of 3-D printing has improved, both the time to print and the material costs have remained high. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a printed model is structurally sound.
 The printed product often does not survive cleaning, transportation, or handling, or it may even collapse under its own weight. We present a system that addresses this issue by providing automatic detection and correction of the problematic cases.
 The structural problems are detected by combining a lightweight structural analysis solver with 3-D medial axis approximations. After areas with high structural stress are found, the model is corrected by combining three approaches: hollowing, thickening, and strut insertion.
 Both detection and correction steps are repeated until the problems have been eliminated. Our process is designed to create a model that is visually similar to the original model but possessing greater structural integrity.

 Nielsen: Indiana drought worst on crop conditions since 1988
 Leaves curl tightly on drought-stressed corn in a Tippecanoe County, Ind. field. A majority of Indiana is in severe to extreme drought, according to the U.S.
 Drought Monitor, http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu (Purdue Agriculture Photo/Jennifer Stewart) INDIANAPOLIS - Indiana crop conditions continue to deteriorate daily as the drought worsens to a level not seen since 1988, Purdue Extension corn specialist Bob Nielsen said Thursday (July 5).
 The state’s corn crop has fallen off such that only 19 percent was rated good to excellent by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Nielsen said during a news conference at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.
 As of July 1, more than 90 percent of the crop acres were rated as short to very short for soil moisture. As a majority of the corn crop enters the crucial and sensitive pollination period, there is little chance for recovery, Nielsen said.
 Without rain and cooler temperatures, he said, corn could lose up to 10 percent yield potential daily. “A break in the drought and heat for the remainder of the season would certainly minimize further deterioration of the corn crop but would not result in recovery to anywhere close to normal yields,” he said.
 Rain that parts of Indiana received in the past week prevented the drought from worsening, but more rain more often would be needed to bring the state out of drought.
 Most of the state continued to experience various intensity of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?IN,MW
) update on Thursday. The southwest and northeast remained in extreme drought, the second-highest level of drought. Purdue Extension agricultural economist Chris Hurt estimated that as of July 1, Indiana had already lost 20 percent of the expected corn yields - down to 133 bushels per acre, compared with 166 expected at spring planting.
 Soybeans fared slightly better in the yield projections, down 15 percent at 41.3 bushels per acre instead of 48.6 bushels expected early in the season.
 Part of the reason is because soybeans still have time to recover somewhat with a return to more normal rainfall. “Soybean yields are significantly related to August temperatures and precipitation,” Hurt said.
 “There is still potential for yield recovery in soybeans up until late July and even into August.” Commodity markets already have taken notice of the projected yield losses.
 At the end of trading on Tuesday (July 3), corn cash prices were up about 27 percent, and soybean prices were up about 5 percent.
 But Hurt said that might not be enough to compensate producers’ lost farm income from low yields. “Indiana is the worst hit of the major corn and soybean states,” he said.
 “This is a situation where Indiana’s average yield losses might not be compensated by high enough prices, and revenues can fall sharply - a potentially difficult financial situation.
” The higher grain prices also could have a ripple effect on animal agriculture, which relies heavily on corn and soybean meal to feed livestock.
 Forages also will be in short supply. “The animal production sector also faces the potential for large financial losses due to much higher feed prices for corn, soybean meal and forages for dairy, beef and sheep herds,” Hurt said.
 The effects of the drought also could touch agricultural businesses, such as handlers and processors, equipment dealers, and seed, fertilizer and pesticide providers.
 Ultimately, consumers are likely to see an increase in food prices of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent into 2013, Hurt said. One bright spot for crop farmers is that they enter the 2012 drought in a better financial situation than what farmers experienced leading up to the drought of 1988, which devastated crops.
 Hurt said farm incomes have been stronger in the past two years and that with land values at record-high levels, crop farmers have generally higher net worth.
 Crop insurance also could play a major role in helping farmers avoid devastation this year, Hurt said. About 75 percent of Indiana crop acres are covered by some form of crop insurance.
 “But crop insurance generally does not provide for full recovery of losses,” he noted. “It is often used to help avoid catastrophic financial losses.
” Crop insurance commonly covers 65 percent to 85 percent of a crop’s overall estimated value, depending on the type and levels of coverage farmers select.

 'No-sleep energy bugs' drain smartphone batteries
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Researchers have proposed a method to automatically detect a new class of software glitches in smartphones called "no-sleep energy bugs," which can entirely drain batteries while the phones are not in use.
 "These energy bugs are a silent battery killer," said Y. Charlie Hu, a Purdue University professor of electrical and computer engineering.
 "A fully charged phone battery can be drained in as little as five hours." Because conserving battery power is critical for smartphones, the industry has adopted "an aggressive sleep policy," he said.
 "What this means is that smartphones are always in a sleep mode, by default. When there are no active user interactions such as screen touches, every component, including the central processor, stays off unless an app instructs the operating system to keep it on.
" "For example, a mailer may need to automatically update email by checking with the remote server," Hu said. To prevent the phone from going to sleep during such operations, smartphone manufacturers make application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to app developers.
 The developers insert the APIs into apps to instruct the phone to stay awake long enough to perform necessary operations. "App developers have to explicitly juggle different power control APIs that are exported from the operating systems of the smartphones," Hu said.
 "Unfortunately, programmers are only human. They make mistakes when using these APIs, which leads to software bugs that mishandle power control, preventing the phone from engaging the sleep mode.
 As a result, the phone stays awake and drains the battery." Findings are detailed in a research paper being presented during the 10th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications and Services, or 
MobiSys 2012, June 25-29 in the United Kingdom. The paper was written by doctoral students Abhinav Pathak and Abhilash Jindal, Hu, and Samuel Midkiff, a Purdue professor of electrical and computer engineering.
 The researchers have completed the first systematic study of the no-sleep bugs and have proposed a method for automatically detecting them.
 "We've had anecdotal evidence concerning these no-sleep energy bugs, but there has not been any systematic study of them until now," Midkiff said.
 The researchers studied 187 Android applications that were found to contain Android's explicit power control APIs, called "wakelocks.
" Of the 187 apps, 42 were found to contain errors - or bugs - in their wakelock code. Findings showed the new tool accurately detected all 12 previously known instances of no-sleep energy bugs and found 30 new bugs in the apps.
 The glitch has been found in interactive apps, such as phone applications and services for telephony on Android that must work even though the user isn't touching the phone.
 The app may fail to engage the sleep mode after the interactive session is completed. "You don't see any difference," Hu said. "You put it in your pocket and you think everything is fine.
 You take it out, and your battery is dead." To detect bugs in the applications, the researchers modified a tool called a compiler, which translates code written in computer languages into the binary code that computers understand.
 The tool they developed adds new functionality to the compiler so that it can determine where no-sleep bugs might exist. "The tool analyzes the binary code and automatically and accurately detects the presence of the no-sleep bugs," Midkiff said.
 The Purdue researchers have coined the term "power-encumbered programming" to describe the smartphone energy bugs. Researchers concentrated on the Android smartphone, but the same types of bugs appear to affect other brands, Hu said.
 The research has been funded in part by the National Science Foundation. Pathak is supported by an Intel Ph.D. fellowship. Note to Journalists
: An electronic copy of the research paper is available by contacting Emil Venere, Purdue News Service, at 765-494-4709, venere@purdue.edu
. Abhinav Pathak (pathaka@purdue.edu), Abhilash Jindal (jindal0@purdue.edu), Y. Charlie Hu (ychu@purdue.edu) and Samuel P. Midkiff, (
smidkiff@ecn.purdue.edu) Despite their immense popularity in recent years, smartphones are, and will remain, severely limited by their battery life.
 Preserving this critical resource has driven smartphone OSes to undergo a paradigm shift in power management: by default every component, including the CPU, stays off or in an idle state, unless the app explicitly instructs the OS to keep it on.
 Such a policy encumbers app developers to explicitly juggle power control APIs exported by the OS to keep the components on during their active use by the app and off otherwise.
 The resulting power-encumbered programming unavoidably gives rise to a new class of software energy bugs on smartphones called no-sleep bugs, which arise from mishandling power control APIs by apps or the framework and result in signi&#64257;cant and unexpected battery drainage.
 This paper makes the &#64257;rst advances towards understanding and automatically detecting software energy bugs on smartphones.
 It makes the following three contributions: (1) We present the &#64257;rst comprehensive study of real-world no-sleep energy bug characteristics; (2) We propose the &#64257;rst automatic solution to detect these bugs based on the classic reaching de&#64257;nitions data&#64258;ow analysis algorithm; (3) We provide experimental data showing that our tool accurately detected all 12 known instances of no-sleep bugs and found 30 new bugs in the 86 apps examined.

 Normal fall foliage expected despite summer's drought
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Rain that Indiana has received the past few weeks could help produce normal colors on fall foliage even though many trees were damaged by the summer’s drought, a Purdue Extension forester says.
 Some trees have lost leaves, and others have leaves that have been scorched by drought, but rains could bring recovery and more coloration, said Lenny Farlee.
 "It's too early to say whether the drought will be a major factor in leaf coloration," he said. "If we continue to get a little rain and lots of sunny weather we could have decent fall color.
" The green color in tree leaves during the spring and summer comes from chlorophyll, which is used in the food-making process for plants.
 Sunlight, water and carbon dioxide combine to make sugars so the plant can survive. Other colors are present in leaves, too, but as a tree makes food for itself the green chlorophyll dominates other colors, such as yellow or orange.
 "As day length gets shorter and we start to get some cooler weather, chlorophyll will start breaking down and stop masking the other colors in the leaves," Farlee said.
 Trees prepare themselves for winter dormancy as the green fades and photosynthesis production stops. With decreased sunlight and water, the tree will rest and live off food stored during the summer.
 Anthocyanin remaining in the leaves after photosynthesis can cause a reddish tint. Tannin, a waste product stored in cells, causes a brown or golden color to show.
 Yellows and oranges are caused by carotenoids. Leaf coloration varies by tree species and the weather an area experiences late in the summer, Farlee said.
 Normal fall leaf colors include yellows, oranges and reds for maple trees; yellows for tuliptrees; yellows and golds for hickories; and browns or deep reds for oak trees.
 The amount of sunlight trees receive also affects color intensity. More sunlight brings more intense colors. "The best weather for colorful fall foliage is when we have bright, sunny days and cooler nights," Farlee said.
 Trees on the outside of woodlands typically are more colorful because they receive more direct sunlight. "The best fall color can often be seen in trees on the edge," Farlee said.
 "That's why trees along roads are more colorful and sometimes are the best way to view fall foliage." More information on fall color is in the publication "Why Leaves Change Color - the Physiological Basis" at

 The simulations must be operated on supercomputers containing thousands of processors, but doing so has posed reliability and accuracy problems, said 
Saurabh Bagchi, an associate professor in Purdue University's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Now researchers at Purdue and high-performance computing experts at the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have solved several problems hindering the use of the ultra-precise simulations.
 NNSA is the quasi-independent agency within the U.S. Department of Energy that oversees the nation's nuclear security activities.
 The simulations, which are needed to more efficiently certify nuclear weapons, may require 100,000 machines, a level of complexity that is essential to accurately show molecular-scale reactions taking place over milliseconds, or thousandths of a second.
 The same types of simulations also could be used in areas such as climate modeling and studying the dynamic changes in a protein's shape.
 Such highly complex jobs must be split into many processes that execute in parallel on separate machines in large computer clusters, Bagchi said.
 "Due to natural faults in the execution environment there is a high likelihood that some processing element will have an error during the application's execution, resulting in corrupted memory or failed communication between machines," Bagchi said.
 "There are bottlenecks in terms of communication and computation." These errors are compounded as long as the simulation continues to run before the glitch is detected and may cause simulations to stall or crash altogether.
 "We are particularly concerned with errors that corrupt data silently, possibly generating incorrect results with no indication that the error has occurred," said Bronis R.
 de Supinski, co-leader of the ASC Application Development Environment Performance Team at Lawrence Livermore. "Errors that significantly reduce system performance are also a major concern since the systems on which the simulations run are very expensive.
" Advanced Simulation and Computing is the computational arm of NNSA's Stockpile Stewardship Program, which ensures the safety, security and reliability of the nation's nuclear deterrent without underground testing.
 New findings will be detailed in a paper to be presented during the Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks from June 25-28 in Boston.
 Recent research findings were detailed in two papers last year, one presented during the IEEE Supercomputing Conference and the other during the International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing.
 "You want the system to automatically pinpoint when and in what machine the error took place and also the part of the code that was involved," Bagchi said.
 "Then, a developer can come in, look at it and fix the problem." "Streaming data to a central server works fine for a hundred machines, but it can't keep up when you are streaming data from a thousand machines," said Purdue doctoral student Ignacio Laguna, who worked with Lawrence Livermore computer scientists.
 "We've eliminated this central brain, so we no longer have that bottleneck." Each machine in the supercomputer cluster contains several cores, or processors, and each core might run one "process" during simulations.
 The researchers created an automated method for "clustering," or grouping the large number of processes into a smaller number of "equivalence classes" with similar traits.
 Grouping the processes into equivalence classes makes it possible to quickly detect and pinpoint problems. "The recent breakthrough was to be able to scale up the clustering so that it works with a large supercomputer," Bagchi said.
 Lawrence Livermore computer scientist Todd Gamblin came up with the scalable clustering approach. A lingering bottleneck in using the simulations is related to a procedure called checkpointing, or periodically storing data to prevent its loss in case a machine or application crashes.
 The information is saved in a file called a checkpoint and stored in a parallel system distant from the machines on which the application runs.
 "The problem is that when you scale up to 10,000 machines, this parallel file system bogs down," Bagchi said. "It's about 10 times too much activity for the system to handle, and this mismatch will just become worse because we are continuing to create faster and faster computers.
" Doctoral student Tanzima Zerin and Rudolf Eigenmann, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, along with Bagchi, led work to develop a method for compressing the checkpoints, similar to the compression of data for images.
 "We're beginning to solve the checkpointing problem," Bagchi said. "It's not completely solved, but we are getting there." The checkpointing bottleneck must be solved in order for researchers to create supercomputers capable of "exascale computing," or 1,000 quadrillion operations per second.
 The research has been funded by Lawrence Livermore and the National Science Foundation. The work also involves Lawrence Livermore scientists Greg Bronevetsky, Dong H.
 Ahn, Martin Schulz and IBM Austin researcher Mootaz Elnozahy. Laguna was awarded a George Michael Memorial High Performance Computing Fellowship during the Supercomputing 2011 Conference in recognition of his work on the project.
 The Supercomputing Conference paper can be accessed online at IEEExplore or ACM Digital Library or from the research group's home page at 
https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl Purdue researchers did not work with the actual classified nuclear weapons software code, but instead used generic benchmarks, a set of programs designed to help evaluate the performance of parallel supercomputers.
 Donald B. Johnston, senior editor, press officer, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 925-423-4902, johnston19@llnl.gov Enterprise and high-performance computing systems are growing extremely large and complex, employing many processors and diverse software/hardware stacks [1].
 As these machines grow in scale, faults become more frequent and system complexity makes it difficult to detect and diagnose them.
 The difficulty is particularly large for faults that degrade system performance or cause erratic behavior but do not cause outright crashes.
 The cost of these errors is high since they significantly reduce system productivity, both initially and by time required to resolve them.
 Current system management techniques [2], [3] do not work well since they require manual examination of system behavior and do not identify root causes.
 When a fault is manifested, system administrators need timely notification about the type of fault, the time period in which it occurred and the processor on which it originated.
 Statistical modeling approaches can accurately characterize normal and abnormal system behavior [4]. However, the complex effects of system faults are less amenable to these techniques.
 This paper demonstrates that the complexity of system faults makes traditional classification and clustering algorithms inadequate for characterizing them.
 We design novel techniques that combine classification algorithms with information on the abnormality of application behavior to improve detection and characterization accuracy significantly.
 Our experiments demonstrate that our techniques can detect and characterize faults with 85% accuracy, compared to just 12% accuracy for direct applications of traditional techniques.

 Online app helps agricultural growers track, manage insect populations 
 Johnny Park, president and CEO of Spensa Technologies, reviews insect data collected in an agricultural field and placed on Mytraps.com.
 Mytraps.com is an online application that will help growers and pesticide consultants electronically track the number of insects in crops to better control insect crop damage and improve the use of insecticides.
 (Purdue Research Park photo)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – An upgraded online application designed and developed by Purdue Research Park-based companies can help growers and pesticide consultants electronically track the number of insects in their crop fields so they can better control crop damage caused by insects and improve the use of insecticides.
 The enhanced MyTraps.com enables growers and consultants to electronically manage insect data and pesticide records on a secure website by entering the data into the site through a Web browser or smart phone.
 The information can then be exported into an Excel document to help growers and pesticide consultants review and update data as often as necessary.
 Spensa Technologies Inc. developed and launched MyTraps.com this year, and Allegro Dynamics LLC developed the software for the program.
 Both companies are based in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette. "Having definitive data that identifies the location and numbers of insects in a given field will help growers target the use of insecticides to areas where there are concentrated insect populations," said Johnny Park, president and CEO of Spensa and a Purdue research assistant professor in electrical and computer engineering.
 "Reducing insecticide use not only reduces the cost to the growers, it reduces the amount of chemicals that are released in the environment.
" Insect management programs are a fundamental aspect of the agricultural business, Park said. In the United States in 2010, crop growers lost $20 billion to insect damage and spent $4.5 billion on insecticides.
 The online application Mytraps.com shows the insect data collected in agricultural fields and an aerial map of the fields so growers and pesticide consultants can electronically manage insect numbers and better control crop damage due to insects.
 (Purdue Research Park image)Download Photo MyTraps.com can be used with any type of crop including corn, green beans, soybeans, apples, oranges, pears and grapes.
 "As an online subscription service, MyTraps.com maintains insect data in a fast, efficient manner that not only shows the current insect population, but also historical data that can help growers anticipate future growing seasons," Park said.
 "Another important feature is that the program provides aerial field images taken from satellite cameras and places the insect data over the image of the fields so growers can see the insect population data on photographs of the fields.
" Spensa also is commercializing the Z-Trap, which automatically detects the number of target insects captured by the trap and sends the data wirelessly to the grower's mobile phone or computer.
 The technology, which was developed by Park at Purdue University, is being used to collect data on codling moths, Oriental fruit moths and leaf rollers in apple orchards, but will eventually be used to collect insect data from other types of crops.
 Park said that Spensa is in pre-production of 75 Z-Traps and will carry out large-scale field experiments and evaluations during the 2012 growing season with an expected launch of the Z-Trap in 2013.
 Spensa Technologies is a startup housed in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette. The company was founded in 2009 by Johnny Park, president and CEO.
 Spensa's mission is to design, develop and deliver novel technologies for the agricultural industry that will reduce reliance on manual labor, foster eco-friendly farming and enhance crop production efficiency.
 Their technologies leverage the team's world-leading expertise in wireless sensor networks, robotics and computer vision. Allegro Dynamics, LLC is a software design company specializing in Web and mobile technologies.
 Allegro works with entrepreneurs to turn their technology ideas into products. Allegro was founded in 2009 by Ben Brame, president, and Zach Mason, director of technology.
 Before coming to Purdue University for graduate school, Brame and Mason worked together at a software company building applications for the Web and for mobile devices.
 Allegro Dynamics focuses on those strengths to build innovative Web and mobile applications. The Purdue Research Park has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country in four locations across Indiana.
 The parks are home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Merrillville, Indianapolis and New Albany.

 Op-Ed: Understanding Media Violence
 Once again, the horror of a violent assault has spread around the globe at the speed of light. Just as the many incidents that preceded it, the recent tragedy in Aurora, Colo.
, has reignited the cultural debate on media violence. It is difficult to know to what extent, if any, the consumption of media messages had to do with the killer’s decision to unleash his assault on an unsuspecting movie audience.
 In response to some voices that react to such assaults by talking about the possible influence of media, some others shout back, “Movies don’t kill people—people kill people.
” Of course, this is true, and many of those who make this point bristle at the notion that by talking about media influence on behavior, the spotlight is redirected away from personal responsibility for one’s actions.
 But we ought to resist feeling forced to choose between a view that emphasizes personal responsibility for behavior and an understanding that the media messages that fill our culture surely have an impact upon us.
 Both are true. Just as we are all personally responsible for our purchasing decisions, we are all responsible for our choice to either refrain from or to engage in violence.
 But few of us believe that the barrage of commercial messages in our culture have no influence upon us. Advertisers and researchers know better.
 Similarly, we ought to know better than to accept the premise that media violence has no impact on us. Decades of research clearly establish that media messages have power.
 The late George Gerbner, who spent most of his career studying media violence at the University of Pennsylvania, pointed out that prior to the advent of electronic media, the central storytellers of culture were parents, educational institutions and the church.
 The primary motivation for telling those stories was to inspire, teach and preserve important values. But the structure of electronic media has altered the balance of influence of those traditional sources.
 Today, many of the most influential stories that permeate our cultural environment are told by folks who care less about the stories they tell—and more about how many stories they can sell.
 Media violence is relatively cheap to produce and speaks in a universal language that is easily exported across cultures to make billions in profits.
 Violence is part of life and to think that it ought never to appear in any of the stories that humans tell is unrealistic. We can learn some important lessons from stories that contain violent themes.
 But, today, the level of graphic violence being produced for entertainment and commercial profit is completely unprecedented in human history.
 To think that we can immerse ourselves and our children in this entertainment without being affected by it is absolutely naïve.
 Decades of research show otherwise. Surely, we all have personal responsibility for our actions. But just as surely, the cultural environment created by the steady stream of media messages that surround us have their impact.
 Viewers who consume large amounts of violence over time are desensitized to it. This puts us at risk. We ought to be cognizant of both of these truths and attempt to live our lives accordingly—striving for the best that we can do for ourselves and for each other.
 Sometimes, the best thing to do is to just turn the TV off—or change to a different channel. Glenn G. Sparks is professor and associate head of the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue University

 Organizers hope statue of Purdue's founder connects him, students
 A statue of Purdue University founder John Purdue is scheduled to be unveiled in late fall. The statue will be on Memorial Mall, near Purdue's grave and across from University Hall.
 The project has been spearheaded by the Order of the Iron Key, a Purdue student society devoted to service-oriented leadership. Iron Key leaders and advisers, gathered outside University Hall, are (front row from left) associate professor of history Nancy Gabin, Sam Lame, Purdue President France A.

 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Helping Purdue students form a stronger connection to the university's founder is the goal of a group building a statue of John Purdue.
 The project is being spearheaded by the Order of the Iron Key, a Purdue student society devoted to service-oriented leadership. 
The statue, honoring the man who started Purdue University, will be located near Purdue's grave on the west side of Memorial Mall, across from University Hall.
 The statue is scheduled to be unveiled late this fall. Purdue was founded in 1869 as a land-grant university under the Morrill Land-Grant Acts.
 This year is the 150th anniversary of when President Abraham Lincoln signed the acts into law. "We believe that many students did not have a clear understanding of who John Purdue was," said Mike James, the president of Iron Key in 2012 who has been involved with the project.
 "Although people recognized the name, their connection with the university's founder did not go much deeper. We want to put a face to John Purdue's entrepreneurial spirit, passion for education and his willingness to give back to the community.
" Chris Foster, Purdue's K-12 STEM coordinator and adviser to Iron Key, said the students did extensive research about Purdue and were impressed with what they learned.
 "They found out he had a lot of the attributes we like for students to have at Purdue today," Foster said. "He was an entrepreneur who worked very hard and started a lot of businesses.
 He also was very philanthropic and helped a lot of people, especially his family and friends." "He was a self-made man and was passionate about education," James said.
 "He came from very humble beginnings and had to drop out of school at the age of 12. His first profession was teaching. Not only did he donate the land and money to start Purdue University, he felt very strongly about how the university should be run.
 In fact, he and the trustees clashed during the university's first few years." The statue, which will be 1 1/4 life-size scale, will feature Purdue seated on a bench, or plinth, and will allow space for students and visitors to sit with him.
 "The students wanted to put the statue in a place where students and visitors would have easy access and be able to sit next to him," Foster said.
 "There will be information about him available so the students can learn more about him." "The Iron Key students felt it was important to associate the statue with the oldest remaining building on campus, University Hall, " Staley said.
 The location was chosen so the statue and University Hall could be captured in a single photograph." After deciding on their project, Iron Key students had to present it to faculty committees and have it approved by the Capital Projects Council.
 They then submitted the proposal to 10 artists and in June selected Julie Rotblatt-Amrany of Highland, Ill. Rotblatt-Amrany's studio has made several statues, including tributes to basketball player Michael Jordan, Chicago Bears coach George Halas, astronaut James Lovell and hockey player Gordie Howe.
 It will cost approximately $150,000 to build the statue, and Foster said Iron Key is now in a fundraising mode. "We hope that by placing a statue of John Purdue on campus, students will gain an interest in learning more about him," James said.
 "We also hope that the statue serves as a source of inspiration to students for years to come." Students are chosen for Iron Key based on leadership and character.
 Their mission is to accomplish something without individual recognition and to learn how to move behind the scenes to achieve goals.

 Pill some day may prevent serious foodborne illness, scientist says
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Modified probiotics, the beneficial bacteria touted for their role in digestive health, could one day decrease the risk of Listeria infection in people with susceptible immune systems, according to Purdue University research.
 Arun Bhunia, a professor of food science; Mary Anne Amalaradjou, a Purdue postdoctoral researcher; and Ok Kyung Koo, a former Purdue doctoral student, found that the same Listeria protein that allows the bacteria to pass through intestinal cells and into bloodstreams can help block those same paths when added to a probiotic.
 "Based on the research, it looks very promising that we would get a significant reduction in Listeria infections," said Bhunia, whose findings were published this month in the journal PLoS One.
 Bhunia's earlier work showed that Listeria triggers intestinal cells to express heat shock protein 60 on their surfaces. That allows Listeria to bind to the intestinal cells using an adhesion protein and pass into them, acting as a sort of gateway to the bloodstream.
 Once in the bloodstream, even small doses of Listeria can cause fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea, as well as headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions if it spreads to the nervous system.
 It can also cause abortion and stillbirth in pregnant women. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it sickens about 1,500 and kills 255 people each year in the United States and primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults and those with weakened immune systems.
 "We're seeing fewer Listeria infections, but the severity of those infections is still high," Amalaradjou said. The researchers found that probiotics alone were ineffective in combatting Listeria, so they stole a trick from the bacteria's own playbook.
 By adding the Listeria adhesion protein to the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei, they were able to decrease the number of Listeria cells that passed through intestinal cells by 46 percent, a significant decrease in the amount of the bacteria that could infect a susceptible person.
 With the adhesion protein, Lactobacillus paracasei interacts with heat shock protein on the surface of intestinal cells just as Listeria would.
 The probiotic then attached to the intestinal cells, crowding out Listeria. "It's creating a competition," Bhunia said. "If Listeria comes in, it doesn't find a place to attach or invade.
" Bhunia said he could one day foresee the development of a pill or probiotic drink that could be given to at-risk patients to minimize the risk of Listeria infection.
 The results came from tests on human intestinal cells. The next step would be animal testing. Bhunia said that would allow him to see whether different doses would have a greater effect.
 Bhunia used funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in previous work on Listeria, but the current study was internally funded.
 Recombinant Probiotic Expressing Listeria Adhesion Protein AttenuatesListeria monocytogenes Virulence In Vitro Background: Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular foodborne pathogen, infects immunocompromised hosts.
 The primary route of transmission is through contaminated food. In the gastrointestinal tract, it traverses the epithelial barrier through intracellular or paracellular routes.
 Strategies to prevent L. monocytogenes entry can potentially minimize infection in high-risk populations. Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) aids L.
 monocytogenes in crossing epithelial barriers via the paracellular route. The use of recombinant probiotic bacteria expressing LAP would aid targeted clearance of Listeria from the gut and protect high-risk populations from infection.
 Methodology/Principal Findings: The objective was to investigate the ability of probiotic bacteria or LAP-expressing recombinant probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei (LbpLAP) to prevent L.
 monocytogenes adhesion, invasion, and transwell-based transepithelial translocation in a Caco-2 cell culture model. Several wild type probiotic bacteria showed strong adhesion to Caco-2 cells but none effectively prevented L.
 monocytogenes infection. Pre-exposure to LbpLAP for 1, 4, 15, or 24 h significantly (P<0.05) reduced adhesion, invasion, and transepithelial translocation of L.
 monocytogenes in Caco-2 cells, whereas pre-exposure to parental Lb. paracasei had no significant effect. Similarly, LbpLAP pre-exposure reduced L.
 monocytogenes translocation by as much as 46% after 24 h. LbpLAP also prevented L. monocytogenes-mediated cell damage and compromise of tight junction integrity.
 Furthermore, LbpLAP cells reduced L. monocytogenes-mediated cell cytotoxicity by 99.8% after 1 h and 79% after 24 h. Conclusions/Significance: Wild type probiotic bacteria were unable to prevent L.
 monocytogenes infection in vitro. In contrast, LbpLAP blocked adhesion, invasion, and translocation of L. monocytogenes by interacting with host cell receptor Hsp60, thereby protecting cells from infection.
 These data show promise for the use of recombinant probiotics in preventing L. monocytogenes infection in high-risk populations.

 Poor pollination leads to moldy growth in corn
 Smut, a fungal disease in corn, grows on an ear where corn kernels typically would be found. Drought, heat and poor corn pollination have lead to higher-than-normal incidences of the disease in Indiana fields this summer.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Jennifer Stewart)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Indiana corn farmers are seeing high incidences of a specific mold in their fields this year after a season-long drought hindered the crop's pollination.
 Smut, a gray, moldy growth on corn ears, is present in Indiana cornfields every year, but rarely at the level of 2012. "Researchers have debated about what conditions favor smut development, but it is reported that poor pollination, dry weather and warm temperatures can increase smut development," said Kiersten Wise, Purdue Extension plant pathologist.
 "That certainly fits the conditions experienced during the majority of the 2012 growing season." Smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago maydis
, which overwinters in crop residue and soil for several years. It tends to infect stressed leaf tissues, typically through wounds caused by hail or insect feeding.
 Smut also infects ear kernels through silks. Tassels and nodes also can be infected. "Once tissue is infected, the fungus causes plant cells to divide and expand, which results in the diagnostic white 'galls' that we see with smut," Wise said.
 "Mature galls are filled with dark spores that may break open and leave a powdery residue on surrounding tissue." Even with the abnormally high incidence of smut, it doesn't affect yield.
 And while seed and foliar fungicides aren't effective against the disease, there are some other management options in the off-season.
 "Management options include tillage and rotation to reduce the amount of debris that harbors the fungus, promoting proper corn fertilization and limiting wounding of corn by mechanical equipment," Wise said.
 Smut is non-toxic and often grown to be consumed as a delicacy. However, Wise cautioned against harvesting and eating the galls from just any cornfield - especially once they start to turn black.
 She also said corn growers and farm workers with lung ailments or mold allergies, and those undergoing immune-compromising medical treatments, need to be cautious during harvest, including wearing mold-rated respiration masks.

 Prof: Be wary of calling Japan's nuclear disaster a cultural problem
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Citing cultural problems as the reason for the 2011 Japan nuclear reactor disaster is risky because some of the key problems involving regulation and technical issues could happen anywhere, says a Purdue University expert.
 "I'm skeptical about putting too much blame on the Japanese culture, because saying something is a cultural problem implies that it may be too big to fix or that it is limited to one group or country," says Daniel Aldrich, an associate professor of political science.
 He studies civil society's influence on the placement of controversial facilities, specifically nuclear power plants. In March 2011, an earthquake and tsunami damaged three nuclear reactors in Fukushima, and that led to radiation exposure in what is called history's second worst nuclear disaster.
 On Thursday (July 5), an independent commission released a report identifying causes of the nuclear tragedy. The report emphasizes Japanese cultural traits, such as not questioning authority, devotion to sticking with the program and insularity, played a role.
 "Instead," Aldrich says, "the focus should be on technical and institutional problems and what can be fixed." He cites the overlap of organizations that regulated and promoted nuclear energy, the lack of evacuation plans for communities outside of the official boundaries of the plant, and the physical design of the nuclear reactor facilities.
 "Such realities are not just a Japanese problem because there can be similar regulatory overlap or concerns regarding resources in other countries.
" Aldrich suggests that some of these concerns can be fixed by separating regulation and promotion agencies. He also suggests including citizens, activists and citizen groups on regulatory panels, as well as improved methods of reporting and attributing scientific findings.
 "Even though the disaster took place in Japan, there has been impact felt around the world," Aldrich says. "Other countries - such as Italy, Germany and Switzerland - suspended their nuclear energy programs, and no matter the resource, countries can learn from what Japan has been through.
" Aldrich, who is the author of "Site Fights: Divisive Facilities and Civil Society in the Japan and the West," says one major change for Japan is how the disaster has motivated the country's civil society.
 The country historically has not reflected public disagreement through protests or lawsuits. Since the nuclear tragedy, large protests toward nuclear energy policy occur regularly, and a number of lawsuits have been filed.
 Websites that support citizen science - where citizens themselves collect and analyze data on radiation levels, for example - also continue to grow.
 "We've seen an explosion in the way civil society expresses its interests," he says. "Before the reactor disaster, almost two-thirds of the population supported nuclear energy, and now two-thirds are against it.
" Source: Daniel Aldrich, daniel.aldrich@gmail.com. Aldrich is in Washington, D.C., and can be contacted by email to schedule phone or Skype interviews.

 Prof: Be wary when 'disgust' tactics used in campaigning
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Political candidates may use disgust as a way to attack, undermine or discredit their opponents when campaigning, but the emotional tool is dehumanizing, says a Purdue University expert.
 "Disgust can be effective in persuading and influencing people, and has been used throughout history as a tool of oppression," says 
Daniel R. Kelly, an associate professor of philosophy who specializes in cognitive science. "Flagrant uses can be found in the past, with egregious and well-known examples coming from Nazi propaganda designed to dehumanize and direct disgust against Jewish people.
 But more subtle appeals to disgust are still made today, often in conjunction with attempts to cast a group of people as outsiders, and thus not deserving of equal treatment or the full spectrum of rights.
 When used in a political context, it can be thought of as analogous to fear mongering." Kelly, who is author of "Yuck! The Nature and Moral Significance of Disgust," says disgust is a powerful tool that elicits aversion.
 "When most people think of disgust, they think of visceral stuff like bodily waste or germs, but research from the past 20 years has revealed that disgust can exert a subliminal influence on social and moral judgments," Kelly says.
 "If people are disgusted by something, they are likely to think it is dirty, tainted, unnatural or just wrong. Political rhetoric that excites disgust is a powerful tool that can be used to discredit or demonize an opponent or position.
 A common way to trigger the emotion is to portray someone as infecting the values or integrity of one's own social group." People, including voters, should be aware of how disgust affects the social process and the judgments they make, he says.
 "I think we should all be suspicious of drawing moral conclusions from disgust reactions, our own or anyone else's," Kelly says.
 "Feeling grossed out by spiders doesn't imply there's anything morally wrong with spiders, and merely feeling queasy about, say tongue piercings or stem cell research shouldn't be taken as a reason to think there's anything morally wrong with either of those either.
 There might be other reasons, of course, but when it comes to deciding the morality of such practices, disgust is irrelevant."

 Prof: Movie violence plays a role in real life
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - While the recent killings at a Batman movie premiere have critics blaming media violence for such crimes and others defending the entertainment industry, a Purdue University mass media expert says the truth about media violence is rarely captured in such debates.
 "We should resist feeling forced to choose between a view that emphasizes personal responsibility for behavior and an understanding that media messages that fill our culture surely have an impact upon us," says 
Glenn Sparks, a professor of communication who studies the effects of frightening images. "We are all personally responsible for our choice to either refrain from or engage in violence.
 To better understand violence in media there are two things to keep in mind. The first is that media messages can be incredibly powerful.
 "Just look at the influence that commercial messages have on us. The advertisers and researchers know this, and decades of research clearly establish that media messages can exert strong influence on consumers.
" The second aspect is that graphic violence in films and television is increasing, and youths are growing up with access to such violence and gore via movies and digital content on the Internet.
 "Today's level of graphic violence is unprecedented, and that is concerning because we know from research that viewers become desensitized when consuming large quantities," Sparks says.
 "We need to be more sensitive to how much violence people, especially young people, are exposed to and carefully weigh the extent to which such exposure is unhealthy.
" Sparks says people need to take breaks from watching so much media violence, and instead spend that screen time connecting with people face to face.
 Parents also need to consider how much their teenagers are consuming. "Parents should tune into children's reactions and ask them about what they thought of the film or what scenes were most disturbing," he says.
 "For the long-term, parents, educators and other adults need to evaluate how much violence is a part of their daily diet and the diets of their family members.
 At this rate, if we fast forward a couple of decades, I expect we'll see a larger component of the population prone to more anxiety problems, and we will live in a society that has become increasingly desensitized to violence.
 Those are consequences that most of us find undesirable."

 Prof: Rewriting history by altering Penn State record is risky
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Vacating 112 of Penn State University's football wins means rewriting history, and that can be dangerous, says a Purdue University historian.
 "It's a bad precedent to alter the historical record to meet the ends of a current problem," says Randy Roberts, a distinguished professor of history who specializes in American and sports history.
 "I am in support of changing the culture that led to these horrific crimes, and while vacating games makes sense if a program was caught cheating with ineligible players, there is great risk in trying to erase Paterno or the success of the program.
 When history is revised - such as when some try to alter slavery's role in the American Civil War or how the former Soviet Union government would literally omit political figures when they fell out of party favor - the larger truth is lost.
" As part of the sanctions in the Penn State child abuse scandal, the NCAA vacated 14 years of the football program's victories dating back to 1998.
 This also means former head coach Joe Paterno is no longer college football's winningest coach. "Dismissing Paterno as the winningest coach as a form of punishment is not the answer.
 He'll always be associated with this tragedy, and I don't see that as a bad thing," Roberts says. "We need to be reminded that humans, programs and institutions can fail.
 History should always honestly record failures and successes. We need to be more sophisticated about how we remember people and events.
" For example, Roberts says that O.J. Simpson's NFL record as the first professional football player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season is still recognized even though he is in prison.
 Roberts has written more than 30 books on topics including Mike Tyson, Joe Louis, Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Oscar Robertson, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Boston sports.

 Prof: Utilizing former presidents in campaign plays to strengths
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Those hoping to be president often reach out to past presidents as a campaign tool, says a Purdue University presidential scholar.
 "Whether a past president is present during an election year can be telling on how history views their legacy," says Bert Rockman
, a professor of political science. "Notice that Bill Clinton is being given an important speaking role at this year's Democratic National Convention, but we rarely hear about Jimmy Carter.
 It's a strategy that is based on the popularity of each former president." Rockman is co-editor of a book series that assesses the terms of former presidents George W.
 Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. He also is working on a book about presidential accountability and is a visiting scholar at the University of Pittsburgh.

 Professor named as next Entrepreneur-in-Residence by Purdue’s Burton D. Morgan Center
 Jessica Huber, an associate professor in Purdue's Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences, will serve as the 2012-13 faculty entrepreneur-in-residence for the Burton D.
 Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship. She has developed a new technology, called SpeechVive, which helps Parkinson's disease patients overcome the tendency to speak too quietly.
 (Purdue University photo/Andrew Hancock)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University speech, language and hearing sciences
 professor Jessica Huber has been named the 2012-13 faculty entrepreneur-in-residence at Discovery Park's Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship
. Huber plans to develop a group of "Entrepreneurial Liaisons" from a variety of Purdue departments and units who can serve as resources for faculty on entrepreneurship.
 She also will host a series of discussion meetings on common issues faced by faculty who are working toward commercialization with their research.
 "It is extremely important that we, as researchers, translate our findings into practice, whether that is through for-profit or nonprofit commercialization," she said.
 "Purdue has demonstrated a strong commitment to commercialization efforts through the development of resources like the Burton D.
 Morgan Center and Discovery Park. I am committed to helping faculty and students who need help finding resources to develop their ideas.
" Huber succeeds Purdue biomedical engineering professor Alyssa Panitch, who served as the inaugural entrepreneur-in-residence for the Burton D.
 Morgan Center. "Purdue is fortunate to have some of the most innovative faculty in the world, including many who have successfully translated that innovation into high-impact commercial products," said Richard Cosier, the Avrum and Joyce Gray Director of the Burton D.
 Morgan Center for &#8232;Entrepreneurship and Purdue's Leeds Professor of Management. "The Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship is pleased to welcome one such person, Dr.
 Jessica Huber, as the 2012-13 academic year faculty entrepreneur-in-residence. She will share her extensive experience and expertise with faculty and students wishing to develop and commercialize their technologies.
" Huber has developed SpeechVive, a device that cues patients to speak louder and more clearly. The device, which rests in the patient's ear, provides a stream of noise similar to the background chatter at a party, cueing the patient to naturally talk louder.
 This response is known as the Lombard effect. A member of the Purdue faculty since 2001, Huber is working with the Purdue Research Foundation to bring the device to market, which could be as early as 2013, for addressing a need for those battling Parkinson's disease.
 The first clinical trial with 39 patients was positive, and even inspired a new wireless version. Purdue has filed a patent on her SpeechVive concept.
 A critical part of Huber's research is to integrate the voice-detection sensor, or an accelerometer, developed in work led by biomedical engineering doctoral students Matias Zanartu and Julio C.
 Ho, and biomedical engineering professor George Wodicka, head of Purdue's Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. Jim Jones, engineering resources manager at Purdue, and senior research engineer Kirk Foster led the design of the first-generation of SpeechVive that was used in the human clinical trials.
 Parkinson's affects 1.5 million people in the United States and is one of the most common degenerative neurological diseases. About 89 percent of those with Parkinson's have voice-related change, which is related to how loudly they speak, while 45 percent of those with Parkinson's are affected by how clearly they speak.
 Huber also was a member of Purdue's Entrepreneurial Leadership Academy class of 2011-12, which she said helped her understand how to share her experiences with faculty members and students to better prepare them for the challenges of entrepreneurship and industry.
 The program is part of the Kauffman Campuses Initiative at the Burton D. Morgan Center. Huber received her doctoral degree in speech science and a master's degree in speech and language pathology, both from the University at Buffalo - State University of New York.
 Her bachelor's degree is in English from St. John Fisher College in Rochester, N.Y. The Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, through its sponsored initiatives and partnerships - including the Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Technology Realization Program, Entrepreneurial Leadership Academy and business plan competitions - aims to stimulate entrepreneurship at Purdue and serves as a state, regional and national resource.
 Opened in 2004, the 31,000-square-foot, two-story Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship was the first building completed in Discovery Park, the university's $750 million interdisciplinary research complex for large-scale projects.
 The Burton D. Morgan Foundation provided funding for the $7 million building.

 Program at Purdue to train grad students in food security
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Thirty-one graduate students from 19 U.S. universities will gather at Purdue University for two weeks in July to study the array of problems involving world hunger in their quest to develop expertise as tomorrow's leaders in helping to find solutions.
 The first Borlaug Summer Institute on Global Food Security will be held July 8-20. It is part of a five-year program to train U.S.
 graduate students in food security and global challenges in sustainable agriculture and related fields such as climate change, water, energy, economics, policy, technology and the environment.
 The U.S. Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security program is funded by a $5 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development.
 "The institute targets the brightest graduate students across our nation and sets the stage for them to become the next generation of leaders tasked with tackling global hunger," said Gary Burniske, managing director of the 
Purdue Center for Global Food Security, which will conduct the program annually. The students come from a variety of educational backgrounds, including animal husbandry, grain processing and storage, climate change, sociology and engineering.
 The institute will open with a reception for the students at 7 p.m. Sunday, July 8, at the center in Discovery Park, a complex of organizations leading large-scale collaborative research efforts on campus.
 Gebisa Ejeta, the 2009 World Food Prize laureate and director of the center, will give opening remarks the next day to begin the training, which will include daily presentations from experts in agriculture, international trade, government policy, the environment and other fields affecting global food security.
 Among speakers are: * Julie Borlaug, assistant director for partnerships of The Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture at Texas A&M University.
 Training will include field trips to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, four farm operations in Hancock County east of Indianapolis, and Historic Prophetstown in Battle Ground, Ind.
 In addition to the summer institute, the Borlaug fellows program will involve a thesis and dissertation research opportunities for U.S.
 graduate students to work in developing countries for 6-24 months. They will lay foundations for new and long-term collaborative research in food and natural resource systems between food insecure nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the United States.

 Purdue, IU Health Arnett launch colorectal cancer research partnership 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University and Indiana University Health Arnett on Wednesday (Sept. 12) announced a joint clinical research study on colorectal cancer, focused on broadening participation from patients in more rural parts of the state.
 Research teams from the two universities are working with colorectal cancer data to develop tools for helping improve prevention, treatment and care of those with cancer.
 With the clinical data, researchers are refining statistical and engineering simulation models to predict how to treat and possibly prevent cancer.
 "This is another terrific example of how great things can happen when IU, Purdue and the private sector collaborate on a major challenge facing our world - in this case, colorectal cancer," said Vic Lechtenberg, acting executive vice president for academic affairs and provost at Purdue.
 "This partnership between IU Health Arnett and Purdue widens the bridge for our scientists and clinicians." Added Dr. Wael Harb, director of Oncology and Research for IU Health Arnett in Lafayette and a partner in the Purdue-IU research advocacy effort: "Cancer won't be eradicated in a single laboratory by an individual researcher.
 We all must come together to assist the research that's being done to give doctors the tools they need to better diagnose and treat cancer.
" This research partnership, with a goal to consent 100 cancer patients, expands the university-led Cancer Care Engineering project, which was launched by Purdue in partnership with the 
Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center in 2006 through $5 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, the Walther Cancer Foundation and the Regenstrief Foundation.
 "Here in a community setting like Lafayette-West Lafayette, that's where 90 percent of cancer patients are treated," said Marietta Harrison, associate vice president for research at Purdue and director of Discovery Park's 
Oncological Sciences Center who is leading the Purdue portion of the partnership with IU Health Arnett. Since the clinical study gained federal approval on July 31, the cancer study has gained more than a dozen participants.
 The key to conquering cancer is early detection, Harrison said. A focus of the Cancer Care Engineering project is to discover biomarkers in individual's blood and tissue that will predict susceptibility to colon cancer, its early onset and which treatment is most likely to work.
 This research requires this type of partnership with the medical community and help from local individuals who wish to participate in research studies.
 "Partnership with IU Health Arnett in this clinical trial on colorectal cancer will help our researchers from Purdue and IU gather samples that will give us a more complete picture of the progression of cancer in patients," Harrison said.
 According to Dr. Harb, more than 1,000 drugs designed to treat cancer are in the pipeline. But it can take 15-20 years of regulatory hurdles and other steps for a single drug to reach a patient.
 At the same time, 5 percent or fewer of all cancer patients currently participate in clinical trials. That percentage must climb if the medical community stands any chance of defeating cancer, he said.
 "People are still dying of cancer, and that's not acceptable. So we need to find answers," Harb said. "Research is the only way to find a cure for cancer.
 Without research, we'd have zero chance to treat cancer." In conjunction with this partnership, Purdue and IU Simon Cancer Center received a $500,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health this spring to launch a regional 
Research Advocacy Network for educating the public about the role they can play in cancer research. The community-based project, awarded to Purdue and the IU Simon Cancer Center through their joint 
Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute project, is housed at IU Health Arnett in Lafayette. It involves the Dallas-based Research Advocacy Network (RAN), which is a nonprofit organization formed in 2003 to bring together participants in the research process with a focus on educating, supporting and connecting patient advocates with the medical research community.
 "We can't change what has already happened. But we can make a difference in how cancer is fought for those yet to come," said project partner Lori Miller, outreach coordinator for the Lafayette-based Community Cancer Network in north central Indiana.
 "Cancer is survivable. And we can make it so for more people." Miller knows that firsthand. She has battled three separate cancers in the past decade and today is cancer free.
 Now, she spends her time encouraging people to participate in cancer research. Even those not currently suffering from cancer can help in this cause.
 "Without more people participating in these trials, drugs that researchers at Purdue and elsewhere will not get the approval in time to help people," Miller said.
 The Cancer Care Engineering project is applying systems-engineering principles, data visualization and statistical modeling to the broad spectrum of cancer prevention, treatment and care delivery.
 The multi-institutional project brings together oncologists, health service researchers, engineers, biologists and others in the war on cancer.
 Included are Purdue researchers from the Oncological Sciences Center and the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, Bindley Bioscience Center, Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering and the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing along with collaborators from the IU Simon Cancer Center, IU Health Arnett, Regenstrief Institute/Indiana University Center for Health Services & Outcomes Research, Notre Dame and the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
 The Oncological Sciences Center, created through a gift from Lilly Endowment in 2005 and housed in the Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, is the 
Discovery Park arm of the Purdue Center for Cancer Research. It builds on existing research areas and is expanding Purdue's thrust into nanotechnology, drug delivery, and cancer care and prevention.
 The Indiana CTSI is a statewide collaboration of IU, Purdue and Notre Dame, as well as public and private partnerships, which facilitates the translation of scientific discoveries in the lab into clinical trials and new patient treatments in Indiana and beyond.
 Led by Anantha Shekhar, the principal investigator of the Indiana CTSI and professor and associate dean for translational research at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Indiana CTSI was established in 2008 with a $25 million Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health, together with nearly $60 million from the state, the three member universities, and public and private donors.
 The Indiana CTSI is a member of a national network of 55 CTSA-funded organizations across the United States.

 Purdue, UNC Charlotte professors lead voluntary code of ethics effort for journals
 The following news release is being issued jointly by Purdue University and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.
 - Professors from Purdue University and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte are bringing editors of academic journals together to reaffirm their commitment to research integrity.
 Journal editors are being asked to sign the Journal Editor Ethics Code, which includes guidelines to promote data transparency when reporting research findings, communicating ethical standards to its audiences and authors, keeping the financial aspects of the journal separate from the peer-review process, and refraining from coercive citation practices.
 For example, a report published earlier this year in the journal Science found that some journals were encouraging authors to add citations to articles that were not needed but could help improve a journal's impact factor.
 "Most authors, reviewers and editors are following ethical practices and do exemplary work, but recent research has revealed that some unethical practices, such as coercive citations, do happen," said Deborah Rupp, the William C.
 Bynam Chair in Industrial/Organizational Psychology at Purdue. "The Journal Editor Ethics Code builds on the ethical standards already in place within various professional associations, publishing groups and journals.
" Rupp is co-leading this effort with Steven Rogelberg, professor and director of organizational science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
 "As a journal editor community we need to take a strong public stance about our ethics around publishing," he said. "Our science depends on editors acting with great integrity and not engaging in practices that directly or indirectly promote corruption of the scholarly process.
 We are pleased with people's interest and commitment to support research integrity by affirming the code." So far, 165 editors and associate editors have signed up to show their support for the Journal Editor Ethics Code.
 The code and a list of editors who affirm they will its guidelines are available at http://editorethics.uncc.edu Rupp and Rogelberg began by contacting editors in their fields of management and psychology, but interest has expanded to other fields such as anthropology and sociology.
 Rupp is the editor of the Journal of Management and Rogelberg is the editor of the Journal of Business and Psychology.

 Purdue, West Lafayette to welcome students living off campus
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - For the 13th consecutive year, volunteers from Purdue University and the city of West Lafayette will go around the New Chauncey and Northwestern Heights neighborhoods on Tuesday (Aug.
 21) evening to meet students living off campus and welcome them to West Lafayette and Purdue. "This is a wonderful tradition that welcomes students living off campus and shows them they are a valued and vital part of both the Purdue and West Lafayette communities," said Melissa Exum, vice president for student affairs.
 "Our goal is to meet students face-to-face as they move into their new neighborhoods and ease their transition into the community.
" Joe Rust, president of Purdue Student Government, said Meet and Greet is a positive way to kick off the new academic year. "The volunteers and the students benefit equally from this event," Rust said.
 "Lexi Hiland (PSG vice president) and I ran on the idea of 'ONE Purdue' in an effort to bring more unity to campus. Meet and Greet is an important step toward our goal of ONE Purdue.
" Volunteers will meet at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Purdue Visitor Information Center, 504 Northwestern Ave. Each volunteer will get a gold Meet and Greet T-shirt, a street map of the near-campus neighborhoods showing student residences, and door hangers with information about Purdue and West Lafayette that they will leave at each residence they visit, Exum said.
 Volunteers will then divide into small teams and walk around the neighborhoods to make their visits. Meet and Greet is arranged jointly by the Purdue University and West Lafayette Community Partnership teams.
 Exum is chair of the Purdue team and Rust is a member of the group. "The main purpose of the teams is to work together to build on the strong relationship between Purdue and the city of West Lafayette," said Beverly Shaw, chair of the West Lafayette team and marketing and grants administrator for West Lafayette.
 "Those of us already here know that West Lafayette and Purdue are great places to be," Mayor John Dennis said. "We want to share that sense of pride in our community with students who may be new to West Lafayette.
" Meet and Greet is open to any West Lafayette resident and Purdue community member who wants to volunteer.

 Purdue ag, biological engineering earns top ranking again
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – U.S.News & World Report's ranking of Purdue University's agricultural and biological engineering program as the top graduate specialty in the nation for the fourth consecutive year reflects a commitment to sustained excellence in developing innovators of the future, the program's leader said.
 "Our graduate programs have grown significantly over past seven years or so, with current enrollment nearly doubled," said Bernard Engel, head of the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering.
 "The ranking confirms the value of graduate studies in our program. It also speaks to the quality of faculty, staff, students and alumni.
" U.S.News & World Report's complete rankings in America's Best Graduate Schools will be available on newsstands April 3. It has published graduate school rankings annually since 1987.
 The magazine in September also rated Purdue's agricultural and biological engineering program as the nation's best undergraduate specialty.
 Engel noted that the university underscored its commitment to students in both agricultural and biological engineering and agricultural systems management with the opening in January of the $4.2 million ADM Agricultural Innovation Center, which offers greater laboratory and classroom opportunities for students.
 Archer Daniels Midland Co. was Purdue's primary partner in the center's construction.

 Purdue again urges bicycle, pedestrian safety
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - With the opening of the academic year, a new campaign aimed at keeping pedestrians and bicyclists safe is again under way at Purdue University.
 Strategically placed crosswalks and bicycle paths are located on and around campus, and Purdue police want people to use them instead of crossing streets at improper places.
 Members of Purdue Student Security Patrol also will be placed at areas in which heavy pedestrian and automobile traffic mix for a few weeks.
 Purdue police Capt. Eric Chin said it is the responsibility of pedestrians and motorists to be aware of the laws pertaining to crosswalks.
 Message boards are at key locations to alert people about crosswalk locations in areas of high pedestrian traffic. Police can warn or cite pedestrians for jaywalking.
 Another police focus, Chin said, will be on bicyclists. The main complaints Purdue police receive are about bicyclists disregarding traffic lights and stop signs, and that they're seen going the wrong way on one-way streets.
 Bikes also should have the proper equipment, such as headlights and taillights, and cyclists should wear helmets and visible clothing.
 Campus regulations do not allow bicycles in university buildings unless approved by the appropriate authority. Bicycles may be ridden on designated drives and bike paths but not on sidewalks unless otherwise posted.
 Cyclists are encouraged to dismount their bikes at crosswalks and walk them to the other side of the street and do the same in crowded pedestrian areas.
 The university requires that bicycles on university property be registered with the Purdue Police Department. Registration is free and is valid for five years.
 Details on bicycle registration are available on the police department's website. Bike owners can pick up a sticker at the police department, 205 S.
 Martin Jischke Drive. * A person riding a bicycle on a roadway has all the rights and responsibilities that apply to those driving a motor vehicle.

 Purdue announces energy master plan, seeks public comment
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University is accepting comments on its Comprehensive Energy Master Plan that was presented Tuesday (Jan.
 10) to the Board of Trustees' Physical Facilities Committee. The plan was designed to meet the university's future energy needs in an affordable and sustainable manner.
 For the next 30 days, beginning Wednesday (Jan. 11), the public can review and comment on the plan at http://www.purdue.edu/ees/cemp 
 Trustees requested the plan last February. Robert McMains, vice president for physical facilities, said his department worked to craft an energy plan that includes stakeholder input and aligns with the university's existing New Synergies and sustainability strategic plans.
 "We intend to implement several of the plan's recommendations to improve operating performance in ways that meet increased demand, contain costs and maintain the environment," McMains said.
 "Because the energy industry is so dynamic, we will revisit and update the plan as needed." Purdue currently is replacing a coal boiler with a natural gas boiler, and staff members continually seek ways to reduce campus energy usage.
 A number of planned new campus buildings will increase demands on the university's heating and cooling capacity, which led to several of the plan's recommendations, including: 
 * Replace Boiler No. 1 with a combined heat and power (CHP) unit by 2014. A CHP is a natural gas-fired turbine similar to a jet engine that also produces electricity.
 * Replace coal-fired Boiler No. 2 with a cleaner-burning alternative. * Build a second satellite chiller plant and add electric water chillers to augment building cooling capacity.
 * Build an 8,000-ton thermal energy storage tank that will allow water to be chilled overnight when electric rates are lower, and then use the chilled water to cool buildings during the day.
 * Increase and improve distribution systems to deliver steam from the Wade Utility plant on the south end of campus to buildings and residences on the north end, and move chilled water eastward from the Northwest Satellite Chiller Plant.
 Those making comments on the plan must submit their name, mailing address, a valid email address, their designation (Purdue student, faculty or staff; in-state community member; or out-of-state community member), and whether they are commenting as an individual or on behalf of a group.
 Comments can also be mailed to Senior Director Energy, Engineering and Sustainability, Frehafer Hall of Administrative Services, 2nd floor, 401 S.
 Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2024. Comments, limited to three minutes per person, also will be received at a public meeting from 7-8 p.m.
 Wednesday, Feb. 15, in Stewart Center, Room 310. Those wanting to comment at the public meeting must preregister by noon on Tuesday, Feb.
 14, by contacting Debbie Johnson at 765-494-2306 from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays. All comments become public record and may be incorporated into the energy plan's final report to be compiled by consultant Burns & McDonnell.

 Purdue apps aiding law enforcement, public safety agencies
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Public safety and homeland security agencies are adopting tools developed by a Purdue-led center to help officials manage emergency response and allocate resources efficiently, sometimes using smart phones or other portable electronic devices.
 The U.S. Coast Guard has used one of the tools to see how hypothetical station closures around the Great Lakes would impact response time, public safety and property loss while highlighting which regions would be exposed to greater risk.
 The system, which has now been adopted nationwide by the agency, allows for a thorough assessment of search-and-rescue operations at each Coast Guard station, said David Ebert, Purdue's Silicon Valley Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and director of the Purdue-led center Visual Analytics for Command, Control and Interoperability Environments, or 
VACCINE. Another tool, called MERGE, for Mobile Emergency Response Guidebook, is being tested by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to evaluate potential hazardous materials dangers on trains.
 Using the MERGE system, the user shoots a picture of hazardous materials placards or signs that are displayed on vehicles or buildings.
 The system then identifies the hazardous materials present based on the images and displays the appropriate response protocol and evacuation perimeters.
 Federal, regional and state officials will meet during an annual VACCINE conference on Sept. 20 at Purdue to discuss subjects including the VACCINE-developed tools, maritime safety, public safety, social media, security checkpoints and the high volume of traffic passing through airport terminals.
 A keynote talk will be given by Vice Admiral Robert C. Parker, commander of the U.S. Coast Guard Atlantic Area. VACCINE is a U.S.
 Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence, and Parker will talk about the value of the centers of excellence and how they can help the Coast Guard and first responders face challenges in today's data-driven society.
 The conference, 8:30 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. in Lawson Hall, Room 1142, will draw participants from the Coast Guard, TSA, Purdue, the Indianapolis Police Department, and homeland security and public safety agencies from Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina.
 The meeting is open to the public and is free, with registration from 8 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. An official from the Indianapolis Police Department will talk about the agency's use of a VACCINE-developed application that allows officers to use cell phones and other portable devices to translate the meaning of gang graffiti.
 GARI, for Gang Graffiti Automatic Recognition and Interpretation, and MERGE use "lightweight algorithms" that operate quickly, have low-energy consumption and require low memory.
 The meeting will include speakers and panelists addressing topics such as the use of visual analytics and technology in public safety and other specialized areas.
 Representatives from VACCINE partner institutions will share information on specific research projects taking place within their organizations during the past year.
 "We will also feature demonstrations of tools and technologies developed by VACCINE and a poster session of research projects being conducted by current graduate students in our Homeland Security Career Development Program," Ebert said.
 More information about the VACCINE Annual Meeting is available by contacting Deb Denno at ddenno@purdue.edu. VACCINE is funded by the U.S.
 Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate.

 Purdue Band Day packs musicians from end zone to end zone
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Thirty-one high school marching bands from across Indiana will help Purdue's "All-American" Marching Band flood Ross-Ade Stadium with color and musical pageantry for the Boilermakers' football game Saturday (Sept.
 15) against visiting Eastern Michigan. "Looking out on the field and seeing 2,000 performers will be pretty impressive," said Matt Conaway, Band Day coordinator and Purdue Bands' newest faculty member.
 The Purdue band will perform pop music, such as "Raise Your Glass" by Pink and "Born This Way" by Lady Gaga, to start the halftime show.
 The massed bands will perform a rendition of the classic TV theme song from "Gunsmoke" under the baton of guest director Keith Rudolph.
 Rudolph, who recently retired from Penn High School. The show also features the auxiliary units of all the schools in the theme from "Peter Gunn.
" It closes with "America On Parade," combining arrangements of "America" and "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." Conaway brought his former high school band to Purdue Band Day and has memories of going with his band as a high school student to a Band Day at Eastern Michigan University.
 "It was my first college football game, and I remember it as being a fun experience," he said. "For most of them, this is their first time to be in a strong intercollegiate athletic environment, and nothing compares to that," Conaway says.
 "The opportunity to stand next to the Purdue Band and to perform with it - not as a warm up act - that's really special." Along with the stadium performances, the Purdue Band also will perform at "Thrill on the Hill," a concert and pep rally at 10 a.m.
 on gameday at Slayter Center. Fans are invited to follow the band back to the Hovde Hall fountain following the game for its final performance of game day and the traditional drum major breakdown.

 Purdue band members to fly world's largest drum into Lake Michigan
 A team of Purdue band members is building a full-size replica of the World's Largest Drum that will fly into Lake Michigan on Sept.
 8 as part of Red Bull Flugtag 2012. The craft was designed by aeronautical engineering student Chris Yamamoto. (Photo provided by Chris Yamamoto)
Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Members of Purdue University's "All-American" Marching Band are building a new version of the World's Largest Drum that will fly over, and into, Lake Michigan.
 The "Droppin the Bass" glider will be launched off a four-story lakefront platform in Chicago on Sept. 8 when it competes in a Red Bull Flugtag
. Team captain Chris Yamamoto, a senior in aeronautical engineering from Cortland, New York, says the big drum design was a natural theme because of how iconic it is throughout the Big Ten conference and beyond.
 "Purdue students have a long history of pushing the frontiers of flight," Yamamoto said. "None is more well known than Purdue band alumnus Neil Armstrong.
 Of course, he flew farther than we will." Yamamoto also will pilot the craft. As a freshman he served as chief engineer for a smaller team that launched a "Speed Train" version of the Boilermaker Special into a second-place finish at the 2010 Flugtag in Miami, just three feet behind a top team of NASA engineers from nearby Cape Canaveral.
 "I hope to use that experience and my now-increased aerospace engineering education to propel us to victory," Yamamoto said. "Of course, my thrust is completely dependent on the muscles of bandmates.
 Unfortunately, all of the football players are busy that day pushing people around at Notre Dame." Successful Flugtag teams typically provide the crowd with a high-energy song and dance routine before launching their craft into the drink.
 Yamamoto says his team’s inherent musicality will help. "We entertained an entire nation at the head of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade," Yamamoto said.
 "We can handle this crowd." Team Droppin the Base includes Heather Robinson of Gary, Ind.; Zach Haley of New Washington, Ind., Alex McHolick of Houston; and Ben Kuttecsh of Brentwood, Tenn.
 The team will be feverishly building its big, winged drum every day through Sept. 5. Volunteer opportunities still exist. The finished craft will be displayed outside the Neon Cactus, the team’s sponsor, at 360 Brown Street in West Lafayette, IN, at approximately 7 p.m.
 on Thursday (Sept. 6). The team departs West Lafayette at approximately 4 p.m. Friday (Sept. 7). Note to Journalists: For broadcast-quality video and photos, contact Jim Schenke, Purdue News Service, 765-237-7296 or

 Purdue chef suggests putting on the dog for your tailgate
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A tailgate menu doesn't have to start with exotic ingredients to be tasty and creative, says Ambarish Lulay, chef in Purdue University's Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management.
 Lulay says the humble hot dog and its big brother, the brat, tailgate staples, can be made over as a not-so-ordinary centerpiece to a football tailgate party.
 -- Add shaved corned beef, potato salad and some crushed crunchy potato chips for a St. Pat's dog. -- Top with a generous helping of shredded barbequed pork and French fried onions for a barbeque dog.
 To add pizzazz to brats, Lulay suggests simmering them with lots of onion in beer. When the brats are plump, move them to the grill to char.
 Meanwhile, reduce the beer and onions until the mixture reaches the consistency of marmalade. Add a dash of soy sauce before topping the grilled brats with the onions.
 -- Cut them into two-inch pieces, wrap the pieces in strips of bacon and put three on a skewer. Grill until done and serve with spicy ketchup.
 -- Cut crusty baguettes into six-inch pieces, hollow them out with a spoon, then shove a grilled brat into the baguette. Add cheese and garlicky mustard.
 -- Wrap brats in rolled-out pizza dough with cheese, mustard and sauerkraut. Bake on the grill with a pizza stone and a lid. -- Top a brat placed in a pretzel hoagie with Thousand Islands dressing, sauerkraut and mustard

 Purdue College of Veterinary Medicine's Priority 4 Paws to benefit animal shelters, students
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University's College of Veterinary Medicine is ready to roll out Priority 4 Paws, a program featuring a mobile surgery unit that will be taken to animal shelters to spay and neuter shelter pets up for adoption.
 The program, scheduled to begin July 30 when the mobile unit will go out for the first time, also will help train veterinary medicine students, said Lyn Freeman, a veterinarian and associate professor of veterinary clinical sciences.
 "The program has three goals. One is to provide care for the shelters," said Freeman, who also is the program's coordinator. "We hope to do 5,000 or more surgeries a year and that those animals will be adopted by new owners who will bring the pets to local veterinarians for future medical care.
 The second goal is to provide practical surgical experience for our students. "Lastly, we want to instill in the students a philanthropic spirit so that when they graduate they will want to help animal shelters wherever they work.
" Donors for the mobile surgery unit include PetSmart Charities, the Tony Stewart Foundation, the Ryan Newman Foundation, Midmark, Purdue University and LifeLine Mobile.
 "Priority 4 Paws is a ground-breaking initiative that furthers our commitment to shelter medicine by enhancing our ability to help animal shelters in Indiana," said Willie M.
 Reed, a veterinarian and dean of the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine. "As Indiana's only college of veterinary medicine, we are excited to launch this program to provide needed spay and neuter surgeries for shelter animals while also improving educational opportunities for our students.
" Fourth-year veterinary medicine students will have the opportunity to choose a three-week elective rotation in shelter medicine and surgery.
 They will work two weeks in the mobile unit and then one week in a shelter, Freeman said. There will be two to four students in the unit at any one time.
 Nancy Ferguson, a veterinarian and small animal shelter medicine clinician hired by Purdue's veterinary medical teaching hospital, will work with the students.
 "Our best resource is the enthusiasm of the students for what we're going to do," Ferguson said. Ferguson and Carrie McCoy, a Purdue veterinary technician working with the program, will travel to shelters with the students four days a week, Freeman said.
 Each shelter will provide a list of patients and will bring them to the mobile unit, where the surgeries will be performed. People at the shelters will be trained on handling the recovery.
 The unit will stay within approximately 115 miles of West Lafayette, at least at the beginning of the program. "We held an open house in February and shelter representatives came to find out more about the program," Ferguson said.
 "They filled out questionnaires and based on those and visits to the shelters, we selected the initial 11 shelters we're working with.
" Freeman and Ferguson have worked closely with Annette Litster, a veterinarian and assistant professor of small animal medicine, in setting up the program.
 "She is the director of the Maddie's Shelter Medicine Program in the college, which helps educate and train students about shelter medicine and the needs of shelter animals," Freeman said.
 "This program helps build excitement and passion for ending pet homelessness." Freeman and Ferguson said Purdue will be one of just five universities with a mobile unit program.
 The others are the University of North Carolina, Louisiana State University, Mississippi State University and Western University of Health Sciences in California.
 The man who helped start one of those, Philip Bushby, a veterinarian and the Marcia Lane Endowed Professor of Humane Ethics and Animal Welfare at Mississippi State, assisted Purdue's efforts.
 "Dr. Bushby inspired us to begin the project and helped us all along the way," Freeman said. "He got us started and helped us all along the way.
 He's been a great mentor." Kevin Doerr, director of alumni relations and public affairs for College of Veterinary Medicine, 765-494-8216,

 Purdue continues enhancement of Armstrong papers, those of other historical flight figures
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University Libraries is continuing the process of preserving and providing access to the papers of late astronaut Neil A.
 Armstrong. The initiative is part of Purdue's effort to be a focal point for researchers and enthusiasts of space and flight. With 23 alumni astronauts, including Armstrong and Eugene Cernan - the first and most recent people to walk on the moon - the university is known as the "Cradle of Astronauts.
" Women's flight pioneer Amelia Earhart was in an aircraft funded by the Purdue Research Foundation during her attempted around-the-world flight from which she never returned in 1937.
 Earhart was a career counselor for women students and an adviser to the Department of Aeronautics at Purdue before the flight. Cernan also donated personal papers to the Libraries' Division of Archives and Special Collections.
 The division, housed in the Virginia Kelly Karnes Archives and Special Collections Research Center on the fourth floor of the Humanities, Social Science and Education Library in Stewart Center, also has the George Palmer Putnam Collection of Amelia Earhart Papers.
 It is the world's largest compilation of papers, memorabilia and artifacts related to the late aviator. Alumni astronauts Roy Bridges Jr.
 and Janice Voss also have donated personal papers to the archives. "The Neil Armstrong papers document his life achievements before and after the moon landing and the manner in which he, a true hero, never took the credit alone but always conveyed that achieving a goal is done through collaboration and teamwork," Purdue Libraries Dean James L.
 Mullins said. "Archiving and stewarding the papers of Armstrong, Cernan and other leaders in flight and space exploration will be one of the most important responsibilities Purdue Libraries has now and into the future.
" Last April, the university announced Purdue Libraries was receiving a $2 million grant from Barron Hilton and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation to endow an archivist for its Flight and Space Exploration Archives.
 Tracy Grimm in July became the inaugural Barron Hilton Archivist for Flight and Space Exploration. "Neil Armstrong's papers served as the impetus for the creation of what ultimately became known as the Barron Hilton Flight and Space Exploration Archives," said Sammie Morris, head of the Division of Archives and Special Collections.
 "Neil's gift of his papers inspired additional Purdue alumni astronauts, engineers and pilots to donate their papers as part of a larger collecting effort.
 Through the generosity of Eugene Cernan, Roy Bridges, Janice Voss and others, the collections have grown, and now the initiative has been endowed by the Hilton Foundation.
 None of this would have been possible without Neil's initial donation." Armstrong graduated from Purdue in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering.
 The papers represent his personal files and date to the beginning of his career. "Neil Armstrong's papers represent one of our most prestigious archival collections," Grimm said.
 "Libraries, Archives and Special Collections builds unique and distinctive original collections to support research and teaching needs.
 The research interest in Armstrong is international and includes historians, biographers and other scholars around the globe. Additionally, teachers will utilize the collection for K-12 educational opportunities to engage schoolchildren in learning about space exploration and the importance of math and science.

 Purdue continues trend of high-caliber students, including many of the state's best
 Purdue University continues a multiyear trend of its first-year students setting foot on campus with higher test scores and better grades than ever before, which helps position them to be successful college students.
 These students, many of whom participated in the orientation program called Boiler Gold Rush (pictured), represent an all-time high in test scores and average high school grade point averages.
 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University continues a multiyear trend of its first-year students setting foot on campus with higher test scores and better grades than ever before, which helps position them to be successful college students.
 "Our retention and graduation rates also are increasing, which shows that these students arrive on campus better prepared and ready to work hard," said Purdue acting President Timothy Sands.
 "College isn't easy, and Purdue has high expectations for students, so we support their strong academic foundation with campus resources, facilities and technologies to help them excel at Purdue.
" The 6,291 first-year students, include 3,432 Indiana residents, 1,851 U.S. nonresidents and 1,008 international students. These students represent an all-time high in test scores and average high school grade point averages.
 The class average SAT score increased by 18 points to a combined 1749 on the critical reading, math and writing sections. This follows an increase of 14 points last year and nine points in 2010.
 The average ACT score increased to 26.9 from 26.6 and 26.3, from 2011 and 2010. The average high school grade point average of the freshmen is 3.66, which is up from 3.62 in 2011 and 3.57 in 2010.
 A number of Indiana's best students also are enrolling at Purdue. There are 621 top students graduating from Indiana high schools, according to the College Board.
 This year, Purdue enrolled 281 Indiana students that match the board's criteria, which is based on SAT scores and grade point averages.
 "We are a higher education destination," Sands said. "Purdue has been noted as one of the top 'best value' colleges and as one of the top universities for job recruiters, and people recognize the value of a Purdue degree in the state, nation and around the world.
" Interest in the university also was captured with the institution's all-time high number of applicants for both levels - graduate at 17,507, and undergraduate at 30,903.
 This year's freshman class size, which is 368 fewer than last year, also represents the university's move toward target student populations of 30,000 undergraduates and 9,000 graduate students.
 "Admissions is strategically moving toward this target enrollment goal by 2014 to continue serving students with high-quality instruction, while matching the size of the student body with our physical and educational resources," said Pamela T.
 Horne, associate vice provost for enrollment management and dean of admissions. During the last several years, Purdue has focused on improving its retention and graduation rates, and for the first time in several years, both the four-year and six-year graduation rates increased.
 Last year the four-year and six-year rates were 42.4 percent and 68.7 percent, and this year they increased to 45.7 percent and 70.2 percent, respectively.
 This follows another increase in retention rates with the first-year retention rate at 90.6 percent compared to last year's 90.2 percent, and the second-year retention rate, 83.7 percent compared to last year's 82.5 percent.
 "Retaining students and improving graduation rates is a higher education issue for all universities, and Purdue is seeing record rates because of our focus on programming in academics and student life," said Victor Lechtenberg, acting provost.
 "The Student Access, Transition and Success area has played a key role with programs such as Boiler Gold Rush and Learning Communities, and we continue to develop more strategic and research-based approaches that establish a framework for student success.
" The total system enrollment - which includes West Lafayette, Purdue Calumet, Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, select programs at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Purdue North Central and the Statewide Technology Program - is 75,703.
 All but 502 Indiana students who applied to the West Lafayette campus were offered admission to the Purdue system. Indiana residents make up 68.8 percent of students in the Purdue system.
 * Statewide Technology, 1,145 College of Technology degrees are offered in Anderson, Columbus/Greensburg, Indianapolis, Kokomo, Lafayette, New Albany, Richmond, South Bend and Vincennes.
 The number of international students on the West Lafayette campus is 8,562, which is 628 students more than last year. "This large and diverse international student population is a valuable component of the educational experience because students have a global experience every day in classrooms, student groups and campus life," said Michael Brzezinski, dean of international programs.
 The Graduate School also saw a record number of total students at 8,163. Last year's graduate school enrollment was 7,937. "The interest in advanced degrees is part of a national trend, and we're glad to see the ongoing interest in Purdue's graduate studies," said Mark J.
 T. Smith, dean of the Graduate School. * Ethnicity: Black or African-American, 1,284; Asian, 1,840; Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 23; Hispanic/Latino, 1,393; American Indian/Alaska Native, 77; and two or more races, 599
 * Undergraduate residency: Indiana students, 17,405; U.S. non-Indiana students, 7,768; and international students, 4,974

 Purdue Convocations offers ways for students to get involved
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue Convocations offers students two ways to get involved this year through participation in their student organizations, 
Convocations Voice Network and Student Concert Committee. Convocations Voice Network, also known as CVN: The Student Ushering Club, was created to support and promote the performing arts presentations brought to campus by Convocations.
 Currently, more than 350 students volunteer their nights and weekends ushering patrons at performances in Elliott Hall of Music, Loeb Playhouse and Fowler Hall.
 Students who participate in ushering at performances are permitted to stay and watch the show at no cost. CVN members may usher for as many or as few shows as they like.
 Callout will be 8:30 p.m. Tuesday (Aug. 28) in Wetherill Laboratory of Chemistry, Room 200. The Student Concert Committee (SCC) helps to advise Purdue Convocations about popular entertainment selections for students on Purdue's West Lafayette campus.
 SCC is a group of 16 student members who are selected through an application and interview process. Those chosen experience the equivalent of an internship in the entertainment industry.
 In addition to weekly meetings, SCC members work on-sale days for SCC shows, are involved in publicity and promotional duties for their events, and work backstage the day of show.
 Each year the committee selects eight new members. Callout will be at 7 p.m. Wednesday (Aug. 29) in Stewart Center's Fowler Hall.

 Purdue Convocations to kick off 110th season with Green Day's 'American Idiot'
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The national tour of the explosive Broadway hit "American Idiot," called "wonderfully raucous" and "emotionally charged" by The New York Times and "flat-out electrifying" by the Boston Globe, will make its West Lafayette premiere at Purdue University's Elliott Hall of Music at 8 p.m.
 Sept. 1 and 3 p.m. Sept. 2. "American Idiot," a 2010 Tony Award-nominated best musical and 2010 Grammy Award winner for best musical show album, features the music of Green Day with the lyrics of its lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong.
 The book is by Armstrong and Michael Mayer and direction is by Tony Award winner Mayer ("Spring Awakening"). The acclaimed creative team also includes choreography by Olivier Award winner Steven Hoggett ("Black Watch"), and music supervision, orchestrations and arrangements by Pulitzer Prize winner Tom Kitt ("Next to Normal").
 The Tony Award-winning scenic design by Christine Jones and the Tony Award-winning lighting design by Kevin Adams also will be featured in the tour.
 Winner of two Tonys, "American Idiot" is the story of three boyhood friends, each searching for meaning in a post 9/11 world. "American Idiot" began its Broadway run at the St.
 James Theatre (March 2010 - April 2011) and its national tour launched in December 2011 in Toronto. "Since its inception, audiences have been surprised by the emotional journey the show takes them on, told almost exclusively through Green Day's songs, including many they are already familiar with and love," said producer Tom Hulce.
 "This is such a potent time for our country and the search of our characters for what to believe in is gorgeously celebrated through Billie Joe and Green Day's wonderfully lush score.
" The musical features the hits "Boulevard of Broken Dreams," "21 Guns," "Wake Me Up When September Ends," "Holiday" and the blockbuster title track "American Idiot" from Green Day's 2004 Grammy Award-winning, multi-platinum album.
 Also included in the score are several songs from Green Day's 2009 release "21st Century Breakdown," and an unreleased love song, "When It's Time.
" "American Idiot" premiered at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2009 and played through November of that year. When the musical opened on Broadway reviews were unanimously positive, with Charles Isherwood of the New York Times calling the show "the most adventurous musical to brave Broadway in the past decade," and the Toronto Star naming it "the first great musical of the 21st century.
" Tickets are $22-$52 for adults and $22-$39 for children 18 years and younger, Purdue students and Ivy Tech Lafayette students. Tickets are available at the Elliott Hall and Stewart Center box offices at 765-494-3933 or 800-914-SHOW.
 Tickets are also available through Ticketmaster outlets. Discounted tickets for groups of 10 or more can be ordered at 765-496-1977.
 Initiated in 1902, Purdue Convocations was one of the first professional performing arts presenters in the United States. Each year, Convocations offers the region 20-30 performances of widely varying genres.
 Purdue Convocations aims to promote frequent exposure to and familiarity with human cultural expression in a multitude of forms and media.

 Purdue creates graduate certificate in hybrid vehicles
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University has launched a new graduate engineering certificate program in hybrid vehicles, a specialty that is expected to grow in demand as hybrids become more common.
 "This program is a great example of integrating research and education," said Leah H. Jamieson, the John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering and Ransburg Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
 "The program gives students technical depth and also breadth, and is responsive to industry needs." The new certificate program is administered by the School of Mechanical Engineering but open to any graduate student in engineering.
 "We expect the program to grow and become permanent at Purdue," said Gregory Shaver, an associate professor of mechanical engineering.
 "After the program ramps up, we hope to issue 10 certificates per year and to have 30 students enrolled at any given time." Participants will be required to take one course in each of three areas: the architecture, or the integrated layout of the powertrain, which consists of the engine, electric or hydraulic motor and generator, transmission and other components; energy storage and controls, with courses focused on batteries or the design of algorithms needed to control the system; and "prime movers," which refers to the design of engines, electric motors and generators, hydraulic motors and pumps, and systems that capture braking energy with flywheels.
 The systems use electric motors as generators while the vehicle is braking, producing power to recharge the battery pack. The Hybrid Vehicle Systems Certificate program was developed through the Hoosier Heavy Hybrid Center of Excellence (H3CoE), which was formed last year and funded with a $1 million grant from the U.S.
 Department of Energy's Graduate Automotive Technology Education initiative. The center will hold a hybrid vehicles workshop at Purdue on Sept.
 12. Experts from industry and academia will gather to discuss the latest technologies and challenges for hybrid trucks and cars.
 Engineers from Cummins Inc., Allison Transmission Inc. and Navistar International Corp., will give talks to address the promise and challenges facing widespread use of hybrid technologies in medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
 The center is leading an effort to cut fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in half for commercial vehicles by perfecting hybrid technologies for the world's burgeoning bus and truck fleets.
 Buses and trucks, particularly vehicles used to transport goods, represent a huge percentage of global fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, said Shaver, who co-directs the center with Maryam Saeedifard, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering.
 The center falls under the umbrella of the Purdue Energy Center Advanced Ground Vehicle Power and Energy Storage initiatives. More information about the workshop is available by contacting Pankaj Sharma, managing director of the Energy Center, 765-496-7452, 
sharma@purdue.edu. The workshop will be from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. in the Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, Room 121, at the university's Discovery Park.
 Registration is free but limited to students and faculty members who are working in, or interested in areas related to medium and heavy duty hybrid vehicles.
 Seating is limited, and prior registration is needed by Sept. 11 before 9 a.m. (The registration site is https://purdue.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_etTQJ7rtTKBnStf
) Registered students will have an opportunity to meet with representatives from companies. A luncheon will include a presentation about future center activities, including industry co-funded projects.
 The Purdue center is one of seven "centers of excellence" at U.S. colleges, universities and research institutions formed through $6.4 million in DOE funding over the next five years.

 Purdue-designed fiber may improve digestive health
 A patent-pending fiber designed by a Purdue University food scientist and tested at Chicago-based Rush University Medical Center could improve digestive health and decrease the risk of colon cancer and Crohn's disease.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., and CHICAGO - Fiber designed by a Purdue University food scientist may improve digestive health and decrease the risk of colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease and diverticulosis.
 Bruce Hamaker, the Roy L. Whistler Chair in Carbohydrate Science in the Department of Food Science, has developed a patent-pending designer fiber that is digested slower than other fiber, which could reduce digestive intolerance.
 "The initial goal of the research was to address the problem of dietary fiber intolerance," he said. "Intolerance is mainly caused by rapid fermentation, which occurs when bacteria extract energy from fiber.
 Nearly everyone is affected by intolerance, depending on the amount of fiber they digest and how rapidly it ferments." The Purdue-designed fiber travels through the large intestine, including the descending colon where colon cancer, diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis commonly occur.
 The fiber can be designed to target different locations. This enables the bacteria in the large intestine to receive important nutrients from the fiber, which promotes overall health.
 "Butyrate, which is produced in high levels by the Purdue-designed fiber, is a beneficial by-product of the fermentation process," Hamaker said.
 "It has an anti-inflammatory effect and is an energy source for the cells that line the colon." The Purdue-designed fiber has undergone two human clinical trials conducted at Chicago-based Rush University Medical Center under the supervision of Dr.
 Ali Keshavarzian, the Josephine M. Dyrenfort Chairperson of Gastroenterology. "The first trial determined the fiber is well tolerated by patients and produces no side effects," he said.
 "The second trial compared the fiber to psyllium, a dietary fiber that is used as an ingredient in high-fiber foods. This trial, which received support from the National Institutes of Health and the state of Indiana, showed the fiber was tolerated significantly better than psyllium, increased butyrate and promoted the growth of good bacteria.
" Hamaker disclosed the development of the fiber to the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization, which filed the patent application.
 Technology managers from the office exclusively licensed the fiber to Nutrabiotix LLC, a Purdue Research Park-based company. Mark Cisneros, president and CEO, said Nutrabiotix is developing a granular fiber product and a soluble fiber product.
 "My colleagues and I believe Nutrabiotix fiber can be sold in the dietary supplements market, the functional foods market and the medical foods market," he said.

 Purdue donations of nearly $300 million second highest in university history
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University reported fundraising activity of nearly $300 million for the fiscal year that ended June 30, marking the second highest annual total ever for Purdue fundraising.
The fiscal year 2012 total of $298.8 million is 32 percent higher than 2011 and second only to the $311.7 million raised in 2003.
 "We're grateful to the alumni and friends of Purdue who made our progress possible," said Purdue President France A. Córdova. "Much of what our faculty, staff and students have accomplished would not have happened without their philanthropy.
 Our donors help make a Purdue degree attainable for students with limited finances, they encourage our best and brightest to reach higher, and they provide the additional support needed for the basic research breakthroughs and inspire the innovations that drive our economy.
"Signature gifts included:* A $10 million anonymous gift for construction of the Center for Student Excellence and Leadership, the centerpiece of a student success corridor that will bring academic enhancement programs, student organizations and extracurricular activities into a new campus core.
* More than $10 million to endow undergraduate and graduate student scholarships and named faculty chairs. Donors signed more than 416 endowment agreements with Purdue this fiscal year, a significant increase that development directors credit to new matching gift programs.
* $10 million to Purdue's international programs for research, training and scholarships from Nanshan Group Co. Ltd., a leading aluminum company based in China.
 The company is building a $100 million, 435,000-square-foot aluminum extrusion facility in Lafayette in part for its proximity to Purdue.
• A gift-in-kind valued at $61.2 million for Synopsys electronic design automation software used in graduate and undergraduate engineering programs and microelectronic and nanoscale research in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
 President's Council membership reached 18,456 members in December, exceeding an 18,000-member goal set five years ago. The President's Council was established in 1972 to recognize the alumni and donors whose private giving is key to moving educational and discovery goals forward at Purdue.
Lisa Calvert, vice president for development, said the total fundraising reached $1.1 billion over Córdova's five-year tenure. "We have achieved campaign-like results without holding a public campaign, which is a significant testament to the generosity of our donors, alumni, faculty and staff," Calvert said.
 "Fewer than five universities with official campaigns have accomplished results such as Purdue."Annual fundraising totals at Purdue are reported according to the standards provided by the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education.
 Net fundraising production includes cash, real estate, gifts-in-kind, deferred gifts and new pledges. Payments made on pledges that were booked in previous fiscal years are not counted.
 A full report on Purdue fundraising efforts will be given to the Board of Trustees on July 20. Sources: France A. Córdova, president@purdue.edu
 Lisa Calvert, 765-494-1704, lcalvert@purdue.edu Note to Journalists: FY 2007 previously held the highest annual total for fundraising net production at Purdue.
 It has been adjusted to account for the rescission of the Alfred Mann Institute pledge, and 2003 now has the record at $311.6 million.

 Purdue economist predicts record losses for pork industry
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The nation's pork industry willcontinue to experience some of its worst economic losses in recent history asrecord-setting drought decimates feed supplies, says Purdue Extensionagricultural economist Chris Hurt.
 Producers could lose about $30 per head this summer andnearly $60 per head during the final quarter of the year as continuedliquidation of herds drives down market hog prices and drought drives up feedprices.
 This exceeds the previous record quarterly losses of $45 per head inthe final quarter of 1998. In the next 12 months, losses could average $33 per head,meaning about $4 billion in losses for the U.S.
 pork industry. "A tsunami of red ink is about to wash across thepork industry, which is facing losses unseen even in the fall of 1998 when hogprices approached zero value," Hurt said.
 "Stressors include morehogs than expected in the market, rapid sow liquidation and record feedprices." The market anticipated a 1 percent increase in slaughternumbers, but in recent weeks, slaughter has jumped by 6 percent.
 The unexpectedaddition of hogs to the market has caused a more than $10 per hundredweightdrop in prices since late July with prices now in the high-$50s.
 A number of factors could be driving the slaughterincrease, but, according to Hurt, it's likely related to the high cost of feedand a desire by producers to sell pigs before market prices tumble evenfurther.
 Based on current lean hog futures, prices for the finalquarter this year are predicted to fall to the mid-$50s per hundredweight.
 Butthe cost associated with raising hogs continues to rise. "Tragically, costs of production are expected to beabove $75 per live hundredweight for the remainder of this summer, fall andwinter," Hurt said.
 Hurt referred to it as a "short-term carnage"and said he expects losses to continue through the winter but for the industryto return to near the break-even point by late spring.
 He expected losses near $38 per head inthe first quarter of 2013, but by the second quarter those should fall to $5per head. The first wave of national hog breeding herd reductionbegan in early August and has continued to intensify.
 Slaughter data show thatin August alone nearly 30,000 sows were sent to market. That's a reduction ofabout 0.6 percent of the national sow herd in just one month.
 That rate willcontinue to increase if corn prices stay at current levels or move higher. Hurtsaid the breeding herd could decline 4 percent to 6 percent from now untilJanuary, but sow liquidation should slow sharply after the winter.
 In the short term, however, hog producers should focus oncost-saving management for market hogs. "The dilemma for the industry is that enormous lossesare going to occur for pigs that are already born," Hurt said.
 "Shortof euthanizing young pigs, reduction of market weights could be a viable optionfor the industry. The weight reductions would reduce total pork supplies, useless feed and enhance hog prices.
" President Barack Obama authorized the government to buy asmall portion of the nation's pork supply, but Hurt doesn't think it will beenough to significantly change falling prices.
 "The volume of pork the government will purchase isso small it will reduce the losses by less than $1 per head," he said. Hurt's more in-depth projections for the pork industry areavailable in his podcast and article, "Pork Industry Faces RecordLosses," in Farmdoc Daily's Weekly Outlook at

 Purdue Enterprise Co. matches faculty consultants, businesses
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue Enterprise Co., started more than a year ago to offer a new way for engineering faculty to provide technical consulting services for private and public companies, has grown to include faculty and staff from throughout the university.
 "It started as a gateway between Purdue University engineering and industry," said Bob Davis, PEC general manager. "But as word spread across campus and through the business community, we've expanded to bring in expertise from other colleges and schools.
" PEC serves as a conduit, matching companies with tough problems and Purdue faculty who can provide solutions. So far, PEC has matched companies with faculty in technology, agriculture and communications, as well as engineering.
 Faculty consultants have looked at issues ranging from the use of non-wood fibers for consumer products to the market for biofuels to the reasons behind a product failure.
 A company engineering manager used faculty to do workshops that helped his staff members improve their communication skills for work sent to senior management.
 Time Compressions Strategies of Indianapolis worked with Vijay Pai, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, to get independent confirmation of the speed of its Ancelus database, which has the capacity to exceed 1 billion transactions per minute.
 "Dr. Pai independently audited the test software, monitored the execution of the benchmarks, audited the stored and retrieved results, and confirmed the recording of results," said John Layden, Time Compression Strategies CEO and a Purdue alumnus.
 As part of the program, PEC provides marketing, contract negotiation and other business support, as well as professional liability insurance.
 "Purdue faculty consultants have extensive technical knowledge and experience in their own fields plus a cross-disciplinary, collaborative approach to solving problems," Davis said.
 "It's that body of knowledge that PEC offers to industry.

 Purdue entomology, engineering professors to receive presidential research awards
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Two Purdue University researchers will receive Presidential Early Career awards for Scientists and Engineers next week from President Barack Obama.
 Assistant entomology professor Ian Kaplan and Alice Pawley, an assistant professor in the School of Engineering Education, are among 96 recipients announced Monday by the White House.
 The award - also known as PECASE - is the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers.
 Awardees are selected for their pursuit of innovative research at the frontiers of science and technology and their commitment to community service as demonstrated through scientific leadership, public education or community outreach.
 The honors will be given during a July 31 ceremony in Washington, D.C. "This is a big honor, and I'm looking forward to the opportunities this will afford me to further my research," said Kaplan, who has been at Purdue for nearly three years.
 "We try to apply ecological principles and ecological theory to best management practices for pests." Those principles and practices include understanding plant-insect interactions, the chemical ecology of insects and sustainable biological control of pests through natural predators.
 "This is an area of increasing importance, and we could not be more proud that Ian has received this recognition," said Jay Abridge, Glenn W.
 Sample Dean of the College of Agriculture. Pawley, who is studying why some groups, including white women and people of color, have remained chronically under-represented in engineering degree programs, also was excited when she was informed of her selection.
 "It's a huge honor to be recognized by the White House," said Pawley, who also is an affiliate faculty member in Purdue's Women's Studies program and the Division of Environmental and Ecological Engineering.
 "Such recognition encourages the American public and funding agencies to support studies aimed ultimately at improving diversity in engineering.
 I am thrilled that feminist research methods hailing from women's studies, blended with engineering education research questions have been recognized in this way.
" Pawley was among six Purdue faculty members to receive a Faculty Early Career Development award in 2010, the National Science Foundation's most prestigious honor for outstanding young researchers.
 Women represent about 18 percent of undergraduate engineering students - a proportion that hasn't changed much in two decades. To address issues of under-representation, Pawley uses information from the personal experiences of under-represented undergraduate students to better understand how different institutional structures affect their persistence and success.
 The research may help policymakers learn how to better structure institutions to better meet the needs of under-represented students.
 She is developing tools, including systematically collected and analyzed stories from students, to teach policy makers to "learn from small numbers" of under-represented engineering students, rather than through statistics alone.
 "Dr. Pawley's pioneering research represents an important component in efforts to increase diversity in engineering," said Leah H.
 Jamieson, Purdue's John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering. "She is working to learn some of the root causes underlying why women and people of color continue to be under-represented in engineering fields.
" The federal agencies involved in nominating the presidential award winners include the National Science Foundation; the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
 The award was established in 1996. Four previous Purdue faculty members to win the award were Demetrio Evangelic and Monica Cox in the School of Engineering Education, Douglas Adams in the School of Mechanical Engineering and Carol Anne Clayson in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.
 Other engineering faculty members to receive the award before joining Purdue are Shirley Dyke, a professor of mechanical and civil engineering, John Sutherland, a professor of mechanical engineering and head of the Division of Environmental and Ecological Engineering, and David Bahr, recently named as head of the School of Materials Engineering.

 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Sharon Katz) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana State Fair visitors of all ages will get a full serving of helpful, practical advice on how to plan healthy meals when they go through a new 
Purdue Extension exhibit. The interactive exhibit in the DuPont Food Pavilion is one of a variety of Extension exhibits and activities during the Aug.
 3-19 fair on the Indiana State Fairgrounds in Indianapolis. The new exhibit "To MyPlate and Beyond" illustrates the U.S. Department of Agriculture's tool that emphasizes the five food groups that are part of a healthy diet: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins and dairy.
 "Visitors will learn how easy it is to shop for food, grow their own, plan meals and eat together," said Lisa Graves, Extension specialist in the College of Health and Human Sciences' Department of Nutrition Science.
 "From child to adult, the exhibit will feature tips and ideas for everyone to build a healthy plate." Participants will "travel" with Max and his dog, Munch, in a flying saucer as they explore simple reminders and other information about eating well.
 Included is a short quiz that will help them understand the exhibit's key messages, such as make half of your plate fruits and vegetables, switch to fat-free or low-fat milk, and enjoy your food but eat less.
 The exhibit was created by the Purdue Agricultural Communication Exhibit Design Center and specialists and faculty in the Department of Nutrition Science.
 Funding was provided by the American Dairy Association and Indiana's Dairy Farm Families. Purdue Extension educators will be available to answer questions and help guide visitors through their MyPlate experience.

 Purdue expert can speak about arsenic in rice
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Purdue University scientist is available to comment on a report alerting consumers to levels of arsenic in rice.
 Consumer Reports plans to release a report detailing arsenic found in rice and rice products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it found similar results in its tests.
 There are no federal limits on arsenic in rice, but the FDA is planning more tests before making any reccomendations on rice consumption.
 Jody Banks, a professor of botany and plant pathology, studies how plants accumulate and tolerate arsenic. Banks has cloned a gene responsible for arsenic tolerance in an unusual fern that hyperaccumulates arsenic.
 Rice plants could be modified with the gene to keep arsenic from accumulating in grains, she says.

 Purdue expert: Making a difference key to attracting young women to engineering, science
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Beth Holloway, director of Purdue University's Women in Engineering Program (WIEP), isn't surprised that a European Commission video designed to attract young women to the sciences has been withdrawn.
 The video, part of a campaign called "Science: It's a Girl Thing!", was withdrawn after stirring up controversy because it featured young women in stiletto heels and short skirts and juxtaposed test tubes with tubes of lipstick.
 "Young women need a wide variety of role models to look up to in engineering and science, not just very stereotypically feminine ones," Holloway said.
 At Purdue, those involved in WIEP and the College of Engineering talk to prospective students about engineering careers both in ways that are relevant to their daily lives and in ways that reflect the global challenges that they will be asked to address, Holloway said.
 "What that means is that we might talk about how engineers work on global issues like water scarcity, food production, and natural disaster prevention, relief and rebuilding.
 Or we might talk about how engineers work on things that affect their everyday lives, such as household items, games and smartphones, and entertainment sources like zoos and amusement parks," she said.
 Last year, Purdue reported a nearly 31 percent increase in enrollment of women in first-year engineering compared to a year earlier.
 The 460 first-year women was the highest number ever for the college. The College of Engineering had 1,534 women undergraduates, also the highest ever.
 Holloway said research done by the Extraordinary Women Engineers Project has shown that what draws young women to engineering and science are the opportunity to make a difference, career flexibility, a good working environment, satisfaction in what they do, and the ability to make a good living.
 "Using these messages has helped us talk to students, especially young women in high school, in a way that makes engineering more appealing and engaging," she said.

 Purdue expert: Obama, Romney appeal to different voter emotions
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — As the presidential campaign intensifies, Democrat incumbent Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney will appeal to different voter emotions, says Chris Kowal, an assistant professor of consumer science at Purdue University.
 Obama's message appeals to the emotion of hope, while Romney's message appeals to the emotions of power and security, says Kowal, who, as part of his work with consumers, studies the communication of emotions.
 He says these were among the emotions the candidates drew from their audiences at their respective conventions. "Obama challenged Democrats to become part of a movement, while Romney asked Republicans to focus on how to recapture the reins of power to secure the future," Kowal says.
 He says those appeals are important because voting is an emotional process. "We vote based on attraction, connection and message.
 We then justify our choice through a cognitive process, looking at the issues," Kowal says. He says this is more likely to hold true in a presidential race than local elections.
 "On the local level, the process is likely to be more rational. The needs of the community take precedence over personality." "A lot of delegates were crying during Obama's speech," Kowal says.
 "That's because once a few started crying, the emotion spread around the convention center."

 Purdue expert: Replacement ref controversy could be good for NFL
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — The mostly negative publicity surrounding the use of replacement referees for professional football games just might have an upside for the NFL, says Richard Feinberg, a Purdue University professor of consumer sciences and retailing.
 The NFL is in a labor dispute with its regular referees, so the league has been using replacements since the start of the preseason game schedule.
 Three weeks into the regular season, the refereeing has generated lots of criticism, including over a controversial call at the end of Monday (Sept.
 24) night's game that led to a Seattle Seahawks win over the Green Bay Packers. "It's a case of all publicity is good publicity since we know that repetition increases awareness and interest," Feinberg says.
 "Although the information is negative, more people will be attracted to watching games. Some of these people may never have seen an NFL game before.
 Some occasional viewers will watch longer. And all of them will talk about what they saw. That's good for viewership." "People will be attracted to NFL games because they anticipate seeing blown calls and furious coaches," he said.
 "This should increase viewership at the same time the viewers are lamenting how bad it all is. People want to do what other people are doing.
 The fact that everyone is talking about this means that if you are not doing the same, you are out of it. And people don't want to be out of it.
" Feinberg says that even when a team and its fans think they've been robbed, there can be a positive. "It builds brand cohesiveness," he says.
 "Fans are more strongly backing their team. This may increase sales of tickets and merchandise."

 Purdue expert says Super Bowl ads may not be worth the money
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — NBC has reported that it sold out advertising time for this year's Super Bowl broadcast before the end of last year.
 And 30-second spots sold for a record $3.5 million. Despite the demand, Super Bowl commercials probably aren't worth the premium prices paid to air them, says Richard Feinberg, a consumer psychologist in Purdue University's Department of Consumer Sciences and Retailing.
 More than 100 million people are expected to watch the Feb. 5 Super Bowl matchup between the New England Patriots and New York Giants, which will be played at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
 When they aren't watching football, fans will be entertained by commercials for everything from beer to clothing to cars. This year, more ads than normal are expected to be longer than the traditional 30 seconds.
 The problem, Feinberg says, is that repetition is the key to sales, and, beyond the Super Bowl, some of the commercials don't get much on-air play to the specific consumer groups who buy the products and services advertised.
 "Since repetition to the right consumer is the foundation of purchases, companies just might be better off with 10 $350,000 commercials targeted to specific consumers than one $3.5 million commercial targeted to a lot of consumers, but not necessarily the right ones," he says.
 Research suggests that many viewers like the ads as much or more than the game itself, Feinberg says. While the extra attention further enhances the effect of a 30-second commercial, liking an ad doesn't necessarily lead to sales.
 A study by Feinberg suggests that even if people watch the commercials, they have a limited impact on longer-term memory. And if consumers cannot remember the companies or the products, the commercials do not lead to sales.
 He asked 100 consumers who watched the 2010 Super Bowl to recall details from as many commercials as they could. About 30 percent could accurately recall at least one company with a commercial, but respondents had low confidence in their memory, indicating that they "thought" that the company had a commercial.
 Few could accurately recall details of the commercials. Feinberg says the most effective Super Bowl commercials are connected to a range of social media, other advertisements and promotions.
 The use of animals, humor, special effects and celebrities increase memorability, but that alone does not mean an increase in sales, he says.
 "The best commercials tap into helping consumers solve a problem, fill a need, make them look better, feel better or be better. The problem with Super Bowl commercials is that there is so much effort to be creative and cute that the real reason why commercials work is lost and ignored," Feinberg says.
 "Super Bowl commercials are celebrated for their creativity and humor, but that doesn't guarantee that consumers will become more aware of a product or make a purchase more likely than if the money had been spent in a less expensive but more effective way.

 Purdue expert to speak at conference on bioeconomy
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Purdue University expert in public policy issues involving biofuels will be a keynote speaker at a conference in Canada assessing the social, environmental and economic implications of expected growth in the bioeconomy over the next decade and beyond.
 Wally Tyner, the James and Lois Ackerman Professor of Agricultural Economics, will be among featured presenters at the "Growing the Bioeconomy" conference Oct.
 2-5 in Banff in the province of Alberta. The conference is presented by the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, the Association for European Life Science Universities, and the Canadian Faculties of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine.
 Environmentalists, policy experts, and science and agricultural leaders from North America and Europe will develop strategies for managing the continued development of biological processes and products such as ethanol and other fuels and industrial products from plants.
 Tyner will speak on financial, technological and government-policy obstacles that need to be overcome for production of cellulosic biofuels from such sources as corn stover, wheat straw, forest residues, Miscanthus and switchgrass to be feasible.
 "Dr. Tyner's extensive knowledge and expertise will be a tremendous resource in our discussion of the many challenges and opportunities that are before us in the practical and responsible development of cellulosic biofuels," said Jay Akridge, Glenn W.
 Sample Dean of the College of Agriculture and a member of the conference planning committee. Because the conference is jointly organized by groups in Europe and North America, speakers from both continents will share their distinct experiences and perspectives, with the expected outcome of achieving shared understanding of the issues and viewpoints among natural and social scientists, economists and environmentalists as well as policy-makers and industry leaders.
 The conference, to be held at the Rimrock Hotel, will include a graduate student component, with a special focus on helping to create a global community among tomorrow's generation of scientists.
 More details about the conference, including registration information, are on the conference website at http://www.ales.ualberta.ca/Bioeconomy/Program.aspx

 Purdue expert urges safety when mowing near water, slopes
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Rainfall around the state has rejuvenated drought-stressed lawns and pastures, leading many landowners to return to their lawn chores.
 With the increase in mowing after a long period of inactivity comes an emphasis on mowing safety. People operating lawn maintenance equipment near bodies of water or on sloping ground should use extra caution, a Purdue University professor of agriculture and biological engineering department advises.
 "Mowing grass and keeping a lawn looking nice should not cost anyone their life," Bill Field said. There have been reports of lawn maintenance equipment overturning, including cases in which the operator and machine ended up in retention ponds or other bodies of water.
 In some cases, the operators drowned as they were pinned underwater by their machine. "Operators should avoid steep terrain, stream banks, edges of retention ponds and steep roadsides," Field said.
 A mower with a higher center of gravity has a greater risk for overturn, but all self-propelled machines are vulnerable to overturning when crossing sloped ground, Field said.
 Even machines with rollover protective structures, called ROPS, and seatbelts can overturn and endanger operators. Approaches to increasing the stability of a mower include adding extra weight to lower the center of gravity or using wider tires to increase the width of the wheelbase.
 But these approaches do not ensure an operator's safety because embankments may give way under the additional weight. Another idea is to leave the area uncut or trim it with a weed whacker on foot if it is unsafe to mow.
 Field suggests additional alternatives, such as mulching the area, using decorative stones or planting permanent vegetation along steep banks or around bodies of water instead of mowing.
 "If you feel like you need to grip something to stay upright or have to reposition your rear end on the seat to give you a sense of stability, it's time to find another place to mow," Field said.

 Purdue experts: Crop report dismal, but not unexpected

 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell)Download Photo INDIANAPOLIS - The U.S. Department of Agriculture's outlook for the nation's corn and soybean harvests reflects what farmers have been seeing for the past two months: vanishing prospects for a good year as their crops wilt from lack of water.
 The USDA's August crop production report, the first projections of how much corn, soybean and other crops are expected to produce this year, paints a bleak picture as Indiana and other eastern Corn Belt states suffer through the worst drought since at least 1988.
 In the report, released Friday (Aug. 10), USDA estimated Indiana's corn crop would produce 605 million bushels on yields averaging about 100 bushels per acre, a per-acre decrease of 46 bushels from 2011 and 57.4 bushels from Indiana's five-year average.
 Soybeans are projected to yield 37 bushels per acre, down 8 bushels from last year and 9.7 bushels from the five-year average. "These are remarkably low numbers, especially on the corn," said Chris Hurt, Purdue Extension agricultural economist.
 "Indiana is the worst of the major production states in terms of corn production. We knew that early on. It started here and then spread to the west.
" Hurt was among agricultural experts who reviewed the crop production report during a panel discussion at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.
 Greg Matli, deputy director of the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's Indiana field office, summarized the report, which projects that the nation's farmers will produce 10.8 billion bushels of corn.
 That is down 13 percent from last year, which also was not a good crop year because of a less severe drought. Soybean production is forecast at 2.6 billion bushels, down 12 percent from last year.
 The agriculture industry expected bumper crops in Indiana and across the Midwest when farmers began planting earlier than normal this spring in what was then favorable weather - unseasonable warmth and little rain.
 There were forecasts that the nation's farmers could produce a corn crop of 14 billion bushels, nearly 1 billion more than the previous record, if the weather cooperated.

 Hopes for a bountiful harvest evaporated as the drought worsened weekly, preventing many corn and soybean crops from developing enough to produce strong yields.
 By the end of the first week of August, nearly three-fourths of the state's corn crop - 73 percent - and 53 percent of soybeans were in poor to very poor condition.
 Because of that, USDA estimates Indiana's 2012 corn crop will yield nearly 38 percent below trend yields. "This is the worst departure from trend yields in Indiana in at least 75 years," said Bob Nielsen, Purdue Extension corn specialist.
 That includes the 1988 corn crop, which was down 30 percent from the previous year. Soybeans were down 20 percent. This year, Indiana's soybean crop still has potential to recover some yield after widespread rains offered much-needed relief early this month, according to Purdue Extension soybean specialist Shaun Casteel.
 "Beans are flexible, and there is a fair amount of growing season left," he said. "We've had some rainfall and more mild temperatures in early August, and if those continue, we can still make up ground.
" Corn, on the other hand, isn't likely to improve much between now and what is all but certain to be an early harvest. "We need to be prepared for an early harvest because not only was the crop planted early, but it also will mature even faster because of drought stress," Nielsen said.
 Even with short corn and soybean crops, Hurt said growers could still find themselves in a profitable situation, depending on final yields and crop insurance coverage.
 "We assume producers need bushels to have an income," he said. "Corn revenues are up 64 percent from what we expected in the spring and soybean revenues are up 24 percent.
 Some growers might have an opportunity to take advantage of the higher prices. "Crop insurance will be another factor. We estimate that 65-75 percent of Indiana's corn and soybean acres are insured.
 Those compensation dollars will be very large this year." Also key in final incomes will be growers' marketing and forward-contracting strategies and whether farms also include livestock, Hurt said.
 This year's devastating drought has brought more attention to farming, the difficulties farmers face because of situations beyond their control and how poor crop yields affect consumers.
 "The level of interest in what's going on - on the farm - has created opportunity for us to reach across the fence to non-farm friends and explain why this matters to them," said Joseph Kelsay, director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture.

 Purdue experts remind about proper food handling amid salmonellosis outbreak
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University food safety experts are reminding consumers to thoroughly wash and properly store all produce in the wake of a salmonellosis outbreak in Kentucky.
 The Kentucky Department for Public Health issued an alert Friday reporting that a salmonellosis outbreak in that state may be related to cantaloupes, specifically melons grown in southwestern Indiana.
 The alert said an investigation is continuing into other salmonellosis cases in Kentucky that could be related to cantaloupe and watermelon consumption.
 At this point, there has been no confirmation that any particular grower or growers are connected to the outbreak. Haley Oliver, a Purdue food microbiologist, said the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration advises washing cantaloupes under running water with a stiff brush and refrigerating the fruit within two hours of cutting.
 "Proper refrigeration stops the growth of Salmonella and E. coli," Oliver said. "With cantaloupe, especially, you should entirely remove the rind from the fruit since that rind has crevices and is porous.
" Oliver said all fruits and vegetables should be thoroughly washed, and anyone with compromised immune systems, including children or the elderly, should cook those foods.
 "This doesn't mean that people need to stop eating melons. Proper washing of all produce minimizes risks of foodborne illnesses," Oliver said.
 An FDA guide to selecting and safely serving fruits and vegetables can be viewed at: http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm114299
 Daniel Egel, a Purdue Extension plant pathologist who specializes in vegetable pathology, said that salmonella is often transferred to food through manure.
 He said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that manure be applied long before crops are planted, that workers wash their hands and that produce should be thoroughly washed to prevent such incidents.
 Note to Journalists: After hours, Haley Oliver can be reached at 765-491-4775, and Daniel Egel can be reached at 812-890-2704.

 Purdue experts: Still some time left to rebound from drought

Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana farmers and livestock producers still can recover from one of the earliest onslaughts of extremely dry conditions in more than two decades, but that time is growing short for some, Purdue University agricultural experts say.
 While drought so early in the year is drying out crop fields and forages, they say it's not time to hit the panic button - yet. 
"Clearly, there are some truly severely stressed regions of the state," said Bob Nielsen, Extension corn specialist." But if you look at the state as a whole, the corn has hung in there amazingly well.
" Corn in Indiana will begin a crucial period for its development in late June and the first half of July - pollination. Insufficient water during pollination can significantly reduce the amount of corn the crop produces by harvest in the fall.
 Corn in a few fields in southern Indiana already has started to pollinate. "The big concern now is as we approach pollination statewide," Nielsen said.
 "We can lose an awful lot of yield potential per day with drought stress during pollination." Although dryness is not uncommon in Indiana in the summer, it is unusual for drought to hit in the spring as it did this year soon after farmers planted corn and soybeans, annually the state's two biggest crops.
 "It is among the earliest onsets of severe, dry weather we've had in at least the last 25 years or so," Nielsen said. Farmers and agricultural economists harken to 1988, when a season-long drought devastated crops, and to 1991, which also saw major reductions in yield because of drought.
 While only 37 percent of this year's Indiana corn crop was rated good to excellent as of June 17, less than 5 percent of the 1988 crop had that rating by then.
 Yields that year ended up 31 percent below the predicted trend yield for that year. In 1991, when drought began later in the growing season, about 75 percent of the crop was good to excellent in mid-June.
 But by the first week of August, it dropped to below 10 percent, leading to a crop that was 27 percent below trend. "Crop condition ratings at this point are nowhere as bad as they were in 1988," Nielsen said.
 "That’s the good news. The bad news is that we're already worse than we were in 1991." Nielsen said it was still possible for the corn crop to produce yields close to trend, but it would need widespread and timely rains now and for the remainder of the season.
 "We don’t want a repeat of '88 and '91," he said. "It's not a disaster yet. We still have opportunities to recover. There has been yield loss that we won’t recover, but I don't think it has been dramatic yield loss.
" Agricultural economist Chris Hurt estimated that dry conditions already could have trimmed 15 bushels of corn per acre in Indiana yields relative to the five-year trend and projections from early planting.
 He projects that farmers could produce about 151 bushels per acre, down from his estimate of 166 at the start of the growing season.
 With Indiana being a high-production state nationally, projected yield losses are beginning to move corn prices upward, Hurt said.
 And, he added: "It won't take much more damage before we see the corn market start to really light up." Hurt projects the potential of Indiana soybeans to fall to about 45 bushels per acre, down from 49 at the start of the season.
 Soybeans that were planted early in the season - in April and early May - are faring better than those planted in mid-May when the dry spell began, said Extension specialist Shaun Casteel.
 But soybeans that have just barely emerged and look stagnant for several days or longer might not be so bad off. That is because beans are putting their energy into developing their roots in these dry conditions rather than their shoots, Casteel said.
 Although soybeans can withstand dry conditions longer than corn, he said bean plants that are severely stressed by drought will produce fewer nodes, reducing yield.
 "But beans can compensate," Casteel said. "If we get timely rains in July or August, we can make up a lot of ground with pod retention and seed size.
 This is provided those plants are at least sustaining themselves during the current dry period. " Indiana has had less rain than normal because of continued high pressure and lack of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, the state's primary source of moisture, according to the Indiana State Climate Office, based at Purdue.
 That has lowered humidity to the point where rain from the West can evaporate before reaching the ground. Compounding the problem is the insufficient moisture Indiana received in the winter, said state climatologist Dev Niyogi.
 "Entering the growing season, we have low soil moistures and reserves to begin with due to the warm winter, and the soil continues evaporating and losing water rapidly," Niyogi said.
 "The rains we may get in parts can help, but planning with drought in mind will be a judicious strategy at this point." A storm front packing rain was forecast to move into Indiana late this week.
 Aside from that, Niyogi did not expect much to change in the next couple of weeks, with dry areas continuing to get drier. "So, unless storms in coming weeks bring good rains, we could be in it for the long haul," he said.
 The low humidity has had a positive effect for livestock producers: It makes nights cool, helping to reduce heat stress in cows.
 Still, producers could face reproductive failures in cows this year because of heat stress, said Extension beef specialist Ron Lemenager.
 He said producers should consider pregnancy checking and marketing cull cows earlier than normal to reduce feed needs and to avoid seasonally lower prices that typically occur October to December.
 "If we don't manage cows correctly this year, even though we have higher feed costs, calf survival and cow herd reproduction can be compromised in year two, which results in less calves marketed in year three," he said.
 "Unfortunately, there are no cheap solutions." Latest developments in crop-related news is available at the Chat ‘n Chew Café at 
http://www.kingcorn.org/cafe Note to journalists: Purdue Agricultural Communication staff will provide frequent coverage of the drought in coming days and weeks as conditions merit.
 Today, a special report gives an overview of the drought's effects on crops and livestock. It includes historical context from severe droughts in 1988 and 1991.

 Purdue Extension has advice for repairing drought-damaged lawns
 Purdue Extension turf grass specialist Aaron Patton places his hand on a bare spot of a drought-damaged lawn. He says if the damaged area is larger than the size of the hand print, then it most likely needs to be reseeded.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Keith Robinson)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Many homeowners with drought-damaged lawns have some decisions to make about how to repair them now that it's the season.
 A Purdue turf grass Extension specialist says it mostly comes down to answering this question: Do I reseed, or will fertilizing be enough to recover my lawn?
 Most grass species in Indiana are "cool-season grasses," said Aaron Patton, who also is an assistant professor of agronomy. "They like cooler weather with adequate water.
" That's not what lawns got this summer, when rain was scarce and temperatures were often in the 90s - even soaring above 100 degrees.
 Many lawns sustained damage or died from the heat and dry conditions. Patton and Cale Bigelow, an associate professor of agronomy who specializes in turf grass science and management, offer guidance to homeowners on the website 
Purdue Turf Tips. * Seed or fertilize? It depends on the size of the damaged area. Patton advises that if an area between clumps of surviving grass is larger than your hand print, then it probably needs to be reseeded.
 Damaged areas that are smaller could be treated with fertilizer to encourage growth and recovery. When buying fertilizer, look on the label for a high percentage of nitrogen content.
 "That's the nutrient that helps plants grow the most," Patton said. *Seeding: Types of seed to buy will depend on whether the area is sunny, shady or a mix of both.
 Fine fescues, such as creeping fescue, are good for shady areas. Kentucky bluegrass or tall fescue are ideal for lawns with full sun.
 "Tall fescue has gained popularity over the last few years in that it keeps its green color longer during drought," Patton said.
 A mix of tall fescue and Kentucky bluegrass works well in areas of high traffic. Patton advised against buying products stating that the seed establishes itself quickly.
 Such seeds typically have a lot of annual ryegrass, which is not cold-hardy or tolerant of heat and drought. "It is not a long-term species for your lawn," he said.
 "Just be real careful when you're buying seed to make sure you get the right turf species." * Site preparation for seeding: Remove debris and patches of dead grass with a garden rake to ensure that the new seed contacts the soil.
 "If we can get the seed down to that area, it will have a much better chance of getting established," Patton said. In addition, aeration is a good way to prepare lawns for seeding, and you also get the added benefits of reducing soil compaction and improving rooting and water infiltration.
 * Starter fertilizers: Such fertilizers are high in phosphorus - good for new lawns established from seed. "It helps a newly seeded lawn to develop its root system and grow strong," Patton said.
 * Herbicides: They can damage seedlings if applied too soon after seeding. Patton advises reading the product instructions to determine how soon you can apply after seeding, often after cutting the new grass three times.

 Purdue Extension has Q-A guide on salmonellosis outbreak
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue Extension has created a guide to help consumers best protect themselves from the recent outbreak of salmonellosis from cantaloupe.
 The guide, in a question-and-answer format, explains the Salmonella bacterium that causes foodborne illness, and it offers steps that people can take to help safeguard against it.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Aug. 17 issued an alert about the salmonellosis outbreak linked to two deaths and many illnesses across the country.
 On Wednesday (Aug. 22), the Food and Drug Administration announced a recall of cantaloupe from Chamberlain Farms in the southwest Indiana community of Owensville in Gibson County because it may be contaminated with 
Salmonella associated with the outbreak. The CDC continues to work with the FDA and local health officials in the affected states to investigate the outbreak and determine if there are additional sources.
 "Since the announcement of the outbreak last week, we know consumers, growers and marketers have questions about their particular situation, and it can be hard to find answers," said Extension horticultural specialist Liz Maynard.
 "We wanted to pull together information together and provide it in a single place. "There are cantaloupes, watermelons and specialty melons grown across Indiana; sold at farm stands, farmers markets, produce auctions and grocery stores; and enjoyed by many as part of a healthy diet.
 We want to make it easy for individuals and businesses to get the latest information that will help everyone stay healthy and continue to enjoy Indiana melons.
" Below are excerpts from the Q&A guide, which is available online at https://ag.purdue.edu/hla/fruitveg/Documents/outbreak2012/SalmonellaQA.pdf
. It is based on current information, which will be updated as needed. A: We don't yet know where the particular Salmonella that caused this outbreak came from.
 However, there are some basic things we do know about how Salmonella can get on produce. Salmonella is common in the environment.
 A cantaloupe could become contaminated in the field if it came in contact with animal feces or soil, or it could be contaminated during or after harvest through contact with a person, equipment or water that was contaminated with 
Salmonella. Good agricultural and sanitation practices, such as applying manure fertilizer long before crops are planted, ensuring all employees wash hands, and using clean water for irrigation and for washing produce, can minimize the possibility of contamination.
 A: Ask the retailer or wholesale distributor if the cantaloupe came from Chamberlain Farms. If it did, do not eat the cantaloupe and do not feed it to animals.
 Put the cantaloupe in a plastic bag and put it in a sealed trashcan so that animals cannot eat it. More information is available from the CDC.
 A: Cantaloupes from other farms have not been recalled. Follow recommended practices for washing, handling and storing cantaloupe before eating it.
 As with any fresh produce, cut away any damaged or bruised areas and wash cantaloupe thoroughly under running water before eating or cutting.
 Washing with soap or detergent or using commercial produce washes is not recommended. Although you will remove the rind before eating, it is still important to wash it first so dirt and bacteria aren't transferred from the knife onto the flesh of the melon.
 Scrub the rind with a clean produce brush before cutting. Dry the cantaloupe with a clean cloth towel or paper towel to further reduce bacteria that may be present.
 A: When you purchase cantaloupe from a farmers market, fruit stand or other outlet, ask the vendor where the cantaloupe came from.
 Unless the cantaloupe was grown on the farm involved in the recall, there is no specific concern.

 Purdue Extension holds regional meetings on drought
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue Extension is scheduling a series of regional meetings across Indiana to help crop and livestock producers manage their way through the financial and operational consequences of the drought.
 The meetings being held at locations throughout the state enable Extension specialists and other agricultural experts to help farmers by providing information about situations they face in their area.
 "Drought conditions vary around the state, so we can plan meetings that address the big questions that farmers have right now," said Jim Mintert, assistant director of Purdue Extension.
 A meeting held jointly by the Cass and Carroll county Extension offices in northern Indiana underscored the interest among producers; 50 people signed up for the meeting, but 85 showed up.
 The program featured speakers who provided information on a variety of topics, including emergency assistance programs of the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency and how to fill out a crop insurance claim. A beef cattle nutritionist gave producers advice on forages, including drought-damaged corn, to feed their cattle amid shrinking feed supplies.
 Eight farmers brought corn stalks to the meeting to have them tested for nitrates so they could determine whether the substance was safe to feed to cattle.
 Results of six tests showed the nitrate levels were too high. The meeting was successful because it gave timely and relevant information from experts who understood the problems of producers in their area, said Tamara Ogle, agriculture and natural resources Extension educator in Cass County.
 "Speakers were not only qualified to talk about their topic of expertise, but they also were compassionate and sympathetic to the audience," Ogle said.
 The meeting also was an opportunity for producers to meet with each other and discuss both similar and unique problems as well as solutions.
 Producers can check with their local county Extension office for the closest meeting to them. Meetings also are being added to Purdue Extension's Drought Event Calendar at 
https://ag.purdue.edu/extension/eden/pages/drought.aspx#calendar as they are planned. The next meetings are Thursday (Aug. 9) at 11 a.m.
 at the Vigo County Fairgrounds, 3901 S. U.S. Route 41, in Terre Haute, and at 7 p.m. at the Benton County Government Annex, 410 S.
 Adeway, in Fowler. Speakers are listed on the Drought Event Calendar.

 Purdue Extension publication a resource for pesticide users
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – A new Purdue Extension publication is designed to remind producers about the basics of measuring pesticides correctly for their operations.
 "Measuring Pesticides: Overlooked Steps to Getting the Correct Rate" is a recent, expert-reviewed publication that helps producers understand the steps needed to properly measure chemicals for pesticide application.
 According to Fred Whitford, coordinator of Purdue Pesticide Programs, not measuring pesticides prevents producers from gaining control of the weeds, insects and diseases in their crops.
 It also can reduce yields or increase costs when additional applications are needed. "Producers rely so much on technology to do work that they sometimes forget that the equipment will not work if the machine tanks are not correctly filled," Whitford said.
 The publication informs pesticide users about measuring products and using the proper measuring devices. "We get so enamored with technology that we often forget that it's the little things that make technology work," he said.
 "A common mistake by applicators addressed in the publication is the misunderstanding of the difference between dry and liquid ounces," Whitford said.
 The confusion can cause the products to be over applied, which increases costs, or under applied, which may result in less control.
 The publication is unique in that it's the only one on the market that covers the proper measuring practices of pesticides. It is relevant for anyone who uses chemicals to manage land - whether a golf course manager, farmer or homeowner.
 The publication was mailed to every pesticide application business in Indiana that is licensed with the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.
 It is available online and in hard copy. Visit the Purdue Pesticide Program page for more information.

 Purdue Extension to host southern Indiana grazing workshop
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Sept. 14-15 Purdue Extension conference in southern Indiana will help livestock producers integrate management-intensive grazing programs in their operations.
 Grazing 102 will run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sept. 14 and from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 15. It will be at the Southern Indiana-Purdue Agricultural Center, 11371 East Purdue Farm Road, Dubois.
 Management-intensive grazing is a system of dividing large pastures into smaller sections and rotating animals frequently. It can lead to higher forage production and use per acre, control weeds and allow parts of the pasture time to fully regrow.
 More information about this type of system is available in Purdue Extension's free publication, Management-Intensive Grazing in Indiana at 
http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/AY/ay-328.pdf "This program will teach some of the fundamentally important concepts to make a management-intensive grazing program work in a livestock operation," said Margie Zoglmann, Purdue Extension Perry County agriculture and natural resources educator.
 Purdue Extension experts will cover topics such as forage types, soil fertility, rotational grazing, animal nutrition, pasture rent and pasture management.
 Program registration is $65 per person and includes lunch and refreshments both days, reference materials, speaker notes and management tools.
 Additional attendees from the same operation can attend for $30 but will not receive reference materials at the discounted rate.
 The deadline to register is Sept. 7. More information about the workshop and registration is available at http://www3.ag.purdue.edu/counties/perry/Documents/Grazing%20102%20flyer.pdf

 Purdue Extension to offer conservation drainage field day
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A field day focused on conservation drainage practices will be presented by Purdue Extension and the Indiana Land Improvement Contractors Association on Sept.
 27 near Lafayette. The Two-Stage Ditch and Bioreactor Field Day will take place at the Throckmorton-Purdue Agricultural Center, 8343 S.
 State Route 231, Lafayette. A two-stage ditch is one constructed by adding benches that serve as floodplains, which stabilize the channel and remove nutrients that might otherwise runoff.
 Participants will watch installation of benches, which are about 10 feet wide, and erosion blankets. They also can watch installation of a bioreactor, which is a large subsurface trench filled with wood chips, that reduces nitrate in drainage water.
 Wood chips serve as a carbon source for bacteria that turn the nitrate into nitrogen gas. Purdue researchers will be monitoring water upstream and downstream of the conservation practices to determine their water quality benefits.
 "The goal is to quantify the price per pound of nitrogen reduction," said Laura Bowling, Purdue University associate professor of agronomy and research project director.
 The field day will begin at 7:45 a.m. with presentations followed by a guided tour. The presentations and tour will be repeated at 12:30 p.m.
 The site will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. for viewing the construction. "This is a unique opportunity for people to see the latest methods to reduce nitrate loads," said Jane Frankenberger, Purdue Extension agricultural engineer.
 More information also is available by contacting Bowling at 765-494-8051; Frankenberger at 765-494-1194; or Jay Young, superintendent at Throckmorton Purdue Ag Center at 765-538-3422.
 Program partners are the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service, Wabash River Enhancement Corporation and Tippecanoe County Soil and Water Conservation District.

 Purdue fire chief urges fire prevention, safety
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Welcome to campus. As another academic year begins and you're in new surroundings or returning for the semester, it is a good time to consider a few tips to help keep you safe from fire.
 These, along with other prevention measures, are available at http://www.purdue.edu/fire/safety_tips.htm * Never throw any heat source, such as a cigarette, in the trashcan, even if you think the spark is out.
 * Use an approved power fault electrical strip to plug in your electronics, and never overload an outlet or run a cord under a rug.
 Our department, with a staff of 29 firefighters is available to you around the clock. Don't ever hesitate to call 911 if you find yourself in a threatening situation.
 As the academic year begins, the Purdue Fire Department will be proactive in our prevention and safety efforts. We have two fire department staff members whose sole purpose is to educate and ensure that housing is in compliance with Indiana code.
 Starting the first week of classes, they will visit each of the 64 fraternities, sororities and cooperatives to discuss fire safety and deliver a template for a building emergency plan.
 The houses will create their own plans from the template, which includes procedures for evacuations and sheltering in place and emergency arrangements for anyone with a disability.
 Soon, these staff members will begin the process of conducting formal inspections of each house. These inspections are designed to identify any safety issues and ensure that they are corrected.
 We will do another round of inspections during spring semester. The fire prevention staff is always available to assist with event planning.
 We also are already working with residence hall assistants on fire safety and what to do until an ambulance arrives during a medical situation.
 We have our own paramedics and ambulances right here on campus, so we are always close by. We encourage parents to take an active role in student housing by asking questions and speaking to their students about fire safety.
 Please take a few minutes to visit the Purdue University Fire Department website at http://www.purdue.edu/fire/history.htm to learn more about us.
 Kevin Ply is the Purdue fire chief. The Indiana Fire Chief's Association named him the 2010 Indiana Fire Chief of the Year for his efforts in college fire prevention safety.

 Purdue focuses on growing global leaders at 2012 Indiana Black Expo
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Encouraging youth to develop academic and community service skills as well as preparing to be global leaders are the themes Purdue University is supporting at the 42nd annual Summer Celebration of the 
Indiana Black Expo. The Expo started July 12 and concludes on July 22 in Indianapolis. Purdue is sponsoring the Youth Leadership Summit July 20-22, which is themed "Growing Global Leaders.
" The three-day event encourages youth, ages 11-18, to focus on their academic, personal and community service goals and develop leadership skills.
 "We are excited to partner with Indiana Black Expo to help young people in the state of Indiana acquire critical life skills as well as understand themselves as global citizens and leaders," said G.
 Christine Taylor, vice provost for diversity and chief diversity officer at Purdue. "We also want them to think seriously about preparing for college, and we want them to be aware of all the excellent opportunities that are available at Purdue.
" Purdue will again host the Super Friday initiative on Friday (July 20). Taylor said the program, open to all youth ages 11-18, is expected to draw up to 300 students from around Indiana.
 Students from Michigan also attended last year, she said. As part of the Friday event, representatives from several colleges and departments will have display tables with interactive activities for students designed to increase awareness about academic programs and related initiatives at Purdue.
 Workshop topics for the rest of the youth summit will include preparing for college, developing strong leadership skills and effective event planning.
 "Through the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), which was founded here at Purdue, one of the highlights will be a real-time conversation, through Skype, with students in Ghana," Taylor said.
 "Virginia Booth-Gleghorn, director of the Minority Engineering Program at Purdue, is working on an EPICS project in Ghana with a group of Purdue students, and there is a NSBE chapter in Ghana.
 We are excited to connect Indiana students to Ghanaian students to discuss global leadership in the 21st century." Purdue also will sponsor an exhibition booth where visitors can learn more about the university through several hands-on activities.
 Taylor said many people support Purdue’s efforts at the Summer Celebration. "This is a collaborative initiative with many partners throughout the university," she said.
 "We will have a very strong and engaged institutional presence at this year's event through our participation in the youth empowerment summit and the Exhibition Hall.
 We invite people to stop by to see Purdue's booth." The Expo's Summer Celebration is the largest ethnic and cultural event of its kind in the nation and attracts more than 350,000 attendees annually.
 It provides networking, educational, career and cultural opportunities for participants. Through events such as the celebration, the Expo generates resources to support its key initiatives, including education.
 Since 1984, the Expo has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to 2,000 Indiana students.

" (Purdue Theatre photo)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University Galleries opens its 2012-2013 season on Monday (Aug.
 27) with an installation of stage designs from Purdue Theatre and changes to its gallery locations. The name of the Robert L. Ringel Gallery (until recently in Purdue Memorial Union) has been relocated to the gallery in Stewart Center.
 And in spring 2013, a new exhibit space will open in downtown Lafayette. The new as-yet-named gallery will be housed on the Courthouse Square in the historic Perrin Building on Main Street.
 "The Miracle Worker, Iphigenia: Beauty Queen and Blithe Spirit" will be presented from Aug. 27 through Oct. 7 in the Robert L. Ringel Gallery in Stewart Center.
 Highlighting the skilled design work and craftsmanship that goes into a theater production, this exhibit presents a year's worth of Purdue Theatre in a unique setting that brings elements from the stage to a more personal scale.
 A gallery-size art installation will be composed of elements from the 2011-12 season productions of "The Miracle Worker," "Iphigenia and Other Daughters," "The Beauty Queen of Leenane," and "Blithe Spirit.
" The installation is being designed and assembled by Russ Jones, associate professor of theater, scenic design and Department of Theatre staff.
 Purdue Galleries director Craig Martin says the installation allows a second look at set designs that might normally be lost after the productions closed.
 "It's a great review of the work of our talented friends in Purdue Theatre," he said. "So many of their efforts exist only for the brief runs of the shows for which they are created, so it's a rare treat to revisit them and really examine what goes into setting the scene on the stage at the Hansen Theatre.
" * Aug. 30. 5:30-7 p.m. Galleries will host an opening reception for the exhibition in the Ringel Gallery. Purdue Theatre staff will present comments on the installation.

 Purdue gets $5.2 million to develop new biofuel process
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - If Purdue University researchers have their way, the term "biofuel plant" will take on a whole new meaning.
 A team received a $5.2 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to develop a plant that can make substances that could be used directly as a biofuel.
 The idea is to reroute carbon that plants currently use to make lignin - a barrier to cellulosic ethanol production - and turn it into a biofuel.
 "Scientists have been focused on getting the sugars out of cell walls and using microorganisms to ferment those sugars into fuel," said Clint Chapple, the grant's principal investigator and a distinguished professor of biochemistry.
 "We want to take advantage of a plant's metabolic pathways to make biofuel directly." Purdue acting President Timothy Sands said the work is an example of harnessing science to find solutions for global problems.
 "Addressing our world's energy needs will take multiple solutions, and Purdue researchers have long been a part of significant developments in this field," Sands said.
 Chapple said about 25 percent of a plant's biomass is lignin, a rigid compound in plants' cell walls and one that cannot currently be conveniently converted to a liquid fuel.
 Chapple's team wants to reroute the molecule that plants funnel into lignin production - the common amino acid phenylalanine - into an alternative metabolic pathway to create phenylethanol, a combustible biofuel that could then be blended with gasoline, much like ethanol is now.
 "We wouldn't be able to literally squeeze fuel from the plants, but it would be close," Chapple said. Co-investigator Natalia Dudareva, a distinguished professor of horticulture, will focus on increasing phenylalanine production in plants.
 John Morgan, an associate professor of chemical engineering, will analyze the results of these efforts and develop mathematical models to determine the most efficient methods for rerouting phenylalanine and for making phenylethanol.
 Chapple said the team would work with the common research plant Arabidopsis before applying any findings to a biofuel plant such as poplar trees or switchgrass.

 Purdue graduates develop game, create their own jobs
 MorVid Interactive LLC, based in the Purdue Research Park, has launched its Pak Attack game for iPhone and iPad. Recent Purdue graduates designed and developed the game and may create their own jobs depending on its success.
 (MorVid Interactive image)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Recent Purdue University graduates who design art for mobile applications may have created their own full-time jobs at a Purdue Research Park affiliate firm through the success of a new game they developed.
 MorVid Interactive LLC launched the Pak Attack game for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Pak Attack is slated for release for Android devices this fall.
 The game is designed to appeal to adults and children, and is rated E (Everyone) by the Entertainment Software Rating Board. David Nelson, CEO and co-founder of MorVid Interactive, said four graduates from Purdue's College of Technology had previously worked on the company's educational, marketing and business development mobile applications.
 "We originally got into the business of building apps because we wanted to create games," he said. "Everyone met to talk about the idea of building Pak Attack.
 We had limited funds, but we moved forward with this program because there is the promise of ownership in the game and full-time positions if it proves successful.
" Nelson said Pak Attack is a strategy and skill game that allows players to compete against the program or one another in a multiplayer mode.
 "Players choose one of four characters - Dragon, Bunny, El Roboto and Toucan - and an opponent. They build a base around their character with wood beams, metal and other materials, then take turns with the opponent to destroy the other's base with a cannon, trebuchet or missile launcher," he said.
 "Players win power-ups during the game, including health for their character, ink blotches to blind the opponent and shields. The first to destroy the opponent's base, wins.
" Chelsea Bill, Sennett Johnson, Andrew Lind and Stephen Woodall earned their bachelor's degree from Purdue in computer graphics technology and worked on Pak Attack.
 Bill, from West Lafayette, Ind., graduated in 2011. She designed and animated the characters, designed the user interface and was digital illustrator for Pak Attack.
 She was hired as a contractor on MorVid Interactive's HearNSpell iPad app, which led Nelson to ask her to create the art for Pak Attack.
 Johnson, from Carmel, Ind., graduated in 2011. He did design work on an early MorVid Interactive iPhone app, and then designed and animated weapons used by the characters in Pak Attack.
 He now has a job with John Wiley & Sons Inc. Lind, from Valparaiso, Ind., graduated in 2008. He designed sound and music for Pak Attack, worked on game design and helped with post-production marketing.
 He has worked on MorVid Interactive applications since 2007. Woodall, also from Carmel, Ind., graduated in 2009 from Purdue, where he was one of Nelson's classmates.
 He created background scenes and assisted in the user interface design of Pak Attack. Nelson said Pak Attack's success will be measured by the number of downloads and amount of feedback it receives from users.
 He said the sole goal of creating the game was to encourage friends who had worked together to take a small amount of time to develop it and potentially create their own jobs.
 "We want to provide jobs for talented artists, designers and programmers who made the game," he said. "In today's economy I hear people say they may not like what they do for a living, but it's a job.
 Hopefully, if Pak Attack is successful, everyone involved can have permanent jobs doing what they love: creating and upgrading games that everyone can enjoy.
" MorVid Interactive's creative team is skilled in developing content including games and education, marketing and business development applications that will engage our clients' consumers.
 We use our experience in game development to create applications that are built to be social and shared among friends. This allows consumers to experience our clients' brands and share them with the world.
 The Purdue Research Park has the largest university-affiliated business incubation program in the country. The park's four Indiana sites are in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.
 The nearly 200 companies located in the park network employ about 4,000 people.

 Purdue graduates urged to seek opportunities, embrace change
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Acting Purdue University President Timothy Sands on Saturday (Aug. 4) sent more than 1,200 graduates off to the next chapter of their lives with a lot of Purdue pride and a little advice for the future.
 In welcoming graduates into the fold as Boilermaker alumni during the summer commencement ceremony in Elliott Hall of Music, Sands urged them to look at how far they've come during their time at the university and to look to the future with confidence.
 "For those of you who are earning your baccalaureate degrees this summer, your earliest days at Purdue may seem long ago," he said.
 "You probably sat in this same hall at Boiler Gold Rush wondering whether you would be able to fulfill the rigors of college and meet the high standard of excellence that is Purdue.
 "The anxious young freshmen who sat here several years ago have grown, and today we celebrate as you become the future leaders of our communities and corporations, of our academic institutions, and our government agencies.
" Sands, who also is Purdue's Basil S. Turner Professor of Engineering, reminded graduates that they have mastered their chosen areas of study and created knowledge, made significant advancements through research and helped design useful tools that will assist others.
 "Among you may be a best-selling novelist, a hotel manager, an inspirational teacher, a compassionate nurse, a cyberforensics genius, or a crop scientist who will help farmers around the world gain greater yields from land that struggles to produce.
 Sands applauded graduates for the confidence, independence, responsibility and leadership they gained at Purdue. As they begin the next phase of life, he noted a few changes of his own, such as moving from Provost Sands to acting President Sands less than a month ago, and he shared what he has learned through life's changes.
 He told the graduates to repeat what works: be patient, but seek opportunities; and to expect change. "You have been taught and mentored by some of the finest faculty in the world.
 Internalize the skills and traits that you found effective in them and apply them to your own life," he said. "Whether you are going on to a faculty position at another university, starting a company or joining a Fortune 500 corporation, you can always draw useful information from the people around you.
 I encourage you to watch and learn from others who are more experienced, and remember, someday, young people will be learning from you.
" Sands noted that Bureau of Labor Statistics reports show that the average person born in the latter years of the baby boom - 1957-64 - held 11 jobs from ages 18-44.
 "But although change is sometimes tough, or even scary, every new position can be viewed as a step closer to something you really want to do or an opportunity to make a greater impact.
 "It leads to personal growth. It helps you refine what type of person you want to be and what you want to do with your career. It often leads to more money.
 Or you might even discover that money is not a major criterion for you, after all. Maybe for you it is autonomy or a sense of higher purpose, or the opportunity to master your field.
 "And there is something else that is good about change: It is something you can count on. It will be a constant in your life." One thing that will never change, he said, is that they will forever remain Purdue Boilermakers.
 Note to Journalists: The full speech will be available at http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/qt/2012/120804SP-SandsCommence.html after 9:30 a.m.

 Purdue history prof to appear on 'History Detectives'
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A Purdue University professor will answers questions about the role the Ku Klux Klan played in Indiana as part of Tuesday's (July 24) "History Detectives" episode.
 The PBS show will feature Cornelius "Neil" Bynum, an associate professor of history who specializes in 20th century African American history, as one of the experts talking about an old musical record produced by the Klan in Indiana.
 The episode will air at 8 p.m. EST and 7 p.m. CT. "Indiana played a key role in the revival of the Klan outside of the South during the 20th century," Bynum said.
 Bynum recorded the television segment in the spring at the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis. He is not sure which parts of his interview will appear in the final show, but during the interview he talked about the role the Klan played in Indiana politics and how the Klan's focus grew from African Americans to immigrants and religious groups such as Catholics and Jews.
 Bynum also is the author of "A. Philip Randolph and the Struggle for Civil Rights," and he is working on his next book "West Indian Radicals and New Negro Opposition to Jim Crow, 1919 - 1939.
" He teaches classes on the black civil rights movement, African Americans and the 20th century labor movement, and African American thought and ideology.

 Purdue in Princeton Review's top 150 'best value' colleges
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University is listed among the Princeton Review's 150 "best value" colleges for 2012, released Tuesday (Feb.
 7).The education services and test-prep company says the list, which appeared in USA Today, "is considered a guide for prospective college applicants to seek out the best value for their money.
"The listing is based on an analysis from surveys conducted from fall 2010 through fall 2011. The top 10 public and private "best values" are ranked; the rest are listed alphabetically.
It is the second time this academic year that Purdue has been recognized for being a good value. In August, SmartMoney magazine ranked Purdue seventh nationally in its college "payback" survey, which quantified the long-term value of a college degree.
"This survey is more evidence that Purdue is a tremendous value," said Timothy D. Sands, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost.
 "Our students obtain an excellent education at a reasonable price. That's why we're attracting the best students."Schools on the best value list were selected based on surveys of administrators and students at more than 650 public and private colleges and universities.
 Selection criteria included more than 30 factors in academics, costs and financial aid.Robert Franek, Best Value Colleges lead author, told USA Today that value is about more than just "a low sticker price.
 The commitment has to be much deeper than that."Tuition at Purdue for the 2011-12 academic year is $9,478 for in-state students and $27,646 for out-of-state students.
 The average SAT score for current Purdue freshmen is 1,325 on the critical reading, math and writing sections.The Princeton Review summary says, in part, "When people think of Purdue University, what usually comes to mind is its outstanding engineering and agricultural programs, but students pursuing other degrees want you to know there are 'many other prestigious majors.
' ""Regardless of your major, 'Purdue prepares students to be leaders by helping them grow personally and professionally during their collegiate years through a combination of strong academic programs, leadership opportunities and social activities.
' 'It provides one-of-a-kind experiences in research, professors and organizations.' "Other universities in the state included in the "best value" survey are DePauw University, Hanover College, Indiana University and the University of Notre Dame.
 In addition to Purdue and Indiana, other Big Ten universities ranked include the University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and Ohio State University.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Neil Armstrong, the first human to set foot on the moon and a Purdue University aeronautical engineering alumnus died Saturday (Aug.
 25). "Neil Armstrong is likely the most famous and inspirational alumnus Purdue has ever had, and he has been an integral part of campus life from his arrival as a young student in the '50s to today.
 This is a sad day for all of Purdue," said Tim Sands, the university's acting president. "He was a humble and private person, but always willing to talk to students.
 He was passionate about encouraging young men and women to pursue careers in science and engineering." Sands asked that Purdue University flags on campus be flown at half-staff in recognition of Armstrong.
 Armstrong earned a bachelor's degree from Purdue in aeronautical engineering in 1955 and was awarded an honorary doctorate in engineering from Purdue in 1970.
 On July 20, 1969, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon as commander of Apollo 11. Armstrong was a long-time supporter of Purdue, serving as co-chair of a major fundraising campaign with fellow astronaut and Purdue alum Eugene Cernan, the last to set foot on the moon.
 Armstrong made many public appearances at the university and lent his name to the Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering. A statue of Armstrong as a young student and a replica of his footprints on the moon grace the entrance.
 The footprints show how far Armstrong could step in the low lunar gravity. "The Purdue community joins the nation in mourning the passing of a great American," said Keith Krach, chairman of the university's Board of Trustees.
 "Armstrong Hall, which bears his name, serves as a reminder of his contributions, not only to his alma mater, but also to the nation and the world.
 His legacy will inspire generations to come." Armstrong donated his papers to Purdue in 2008. The archive also contains 55 hours of one-on-one tape-recorded interviews conducted by authorized Armstrong biographer James R.
 Hansen. Hansen's book, "First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong," spent three weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers list. Armstrong was an ardent football fan, citing that as one of the reasons he selected Purdue.
 He played the baritone horn in the Purdue "All-American" Marching Band in 1952, He returned years later for several halftime events at Ross-Ade Stadium, where he was honored with an invitation to beat Purdue's World's Largest Drum and wave the university flag during the fourth quarter of a Boilermaker football game.

 Purdue offering new degree in environmental and ecological engineering
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University will award its first bachelor's degrees in environmental and ecological engineering next May.
 The Indiana Commission for Higher Education approved the degree Sept. 14, the final step in establishing a new program. The new degree will be administered by the Division of Environmental and Ecological Engineering (EEE).
 The division was established five years ago as an independent academic unit within the College of Engineering. John W. Sutherland, the Fehsenfeld Family Head of EEE, said that until now, students had earned degrees in multidisciplinary engineering.
 With the approval, 42 students will transition into the new EEE bachelor's degree program. Several additional students are expected to transfer from other programs, bringing the number of EEE majors to more than 50, Sutherland said.
 "The target size for our undergraduate program is 115; we should be producing 35 graduates per year within five to six years," he said.
 "As a division, we are able to engage faculty from across all of engineering to deliver EEE courses," Sutherland said. "This allows us to draw on broad expertise to address fundamental engineering issues with respect to environmental protection and environmental quality.
 "Our approach is different from many other environmental engineering programs. We don't just focus on pollution control and managing legacy and existing environmental problems," he said.
 "In addition, we emphasize the need to design engineered systems to proactively prevent future environmental challenges." Sutherland said the demand for students with an environmental and ecological engineering degree is strong; the rate of environmental engineering job growth is the second-highest of all engineering disciplines, lagging only biomedical engineering.
 He noted that during the recent Industrial Roundtable job fair on campus, the students who are expected to earn EEE degrees in May drew tremendous interest from potential employers.
 EEE also is an attractive engineering discipline for young women. The students in the new degree program are 55 percent female. That compares with 2011-12 enrollments of 21 percent female for all of engineering and 42.6 percent female for all of Purdue.

 Purdue offers rides in plane model in which Armstrong took first flight
 The Experimental Aircraft Association is bringing a 1929 Ford Tri-Motor to the Purdue Airport on Wednesday (Sept 5). Purdue students, faculty and staff will be able to ride in the plane, which served as one of the world’s first airliners.
 (Photo provided by the Experimental Aircraft Association)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue's Experimental Aircraft Association
 Chapter 256 on Wednesday (Sept. 5) will bring to campus a 1929 Ford Tri-Motor airplane, a 1930s icon that revolutionized commercial air travel by making transcontinetal and international flights feasible.
 A limited number of tickets are available to Purdue students, staff and faculty for a series of flights between 9:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.
 at the Purdue Airport. "We're training our students to push the aviation industry forward," said Brent Bowen, aviation technology
 department head. "It is invaluable to get them firsthand experience with an aircraft that dramatically changed the industry." Affectionately known as the "Tin Goose," the 12-passenger plane was easily recognized because of its three prominent radial engines and its corrogated aluminum skin, which led Ford to claim the plane was the "safest around.
" When Neil Armstrong was just 6 years old, his father pulled him from Sunday school one day to take his first flight, an aerial tour of their town of Warren, Ohio, in a Tri-Motor that was visiting as part of an airshow.
 "Neil's dad claimed to be scared nearly to death because the plane rattled so much," said Purdue aviation historian John Norberg.
 "But Neil quickly proceded to fly model airplanes and worked several jobs to afford flight lessons when he was 15." Experimental Aircraft Association pilot Larry Harmacinski, a 1980 Purdue graduate, will fly the Tri-Motor in from Ohio and pilot its flights at Purdue.
 He said it's quite different than the B-737s he flies for a living. "There is a nice solid feel to the Ford, and she has a gentle nature to her, but it is a hands-on, stick and rudder airplane, which is one of the reasons I love flying it so much," Harmacinski said.
 "In its day it was a very large airplane, and it is no exaggeration to say that Henry Ford advanced commercial aviation greater than anybody else in the late 1920s.
" This Tri-Motor is one of only eight surviving. In 1973 the EAA gave the plane a $1 million rebuild after a long career that saw it serve as the flagship plane of the nascent Eastern Airlines, a Cubana Airlines airliner, the Dominican Republic's presidential plane, a Montana crop duster, an airborne forest fire fighter and a smokejumper transport.

 Purdue physicists part of discovery of new particle that could be Higgs boson
 Purdue University professors Ian Shipsey and Daniela Bortoletto stand with Edinburgh University professors Alan Walker and Peter Higgs at CERN.
 Purdue scientists were part of the team of scientists who announced on July 4 the discovery of a new particle that may be the Higgs boson.
 Higgs is the professor for whom the particle is named and was the first to suggest the particle as the mechanism that gives mass to matter.

 — Purdue University scientists were part of a historical event this 4th of July as scientists working on the biggest international experiment in particle physics history announced the discovery of a new particle that may be the long-sought Higgs boson.
 Purdue's particle physics group has been a part of the more than two-decade search for the elusive particle, which could confirm the Standard Model of physics and provide insight into how the universe formed.
 Daniela Bortoletto, the Edward Purcell Distinguished Professor of Physics, and Ian Shipsey, the Julian Schwinger Distinguished Professor of Physics, attended the announcement at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.
 "On a day where fireworks lit up skies across America, the world of science unveiled explosive news concerning the longtime elusive Higgs boson particle," said Shipsey, who also is the co-coordinator of the Large Hadron Collider Physics Center at Fermilab, near Chicago, and was recently elected chair of the Compact Muon Solenoid Collaboration Board at CERN.
 "More data are needed to establish whether this new particle has all the properties of the Standard Model Higgs boson or whether some do not match, which would imply new physics beyond the Standard Model.
 Either way we've discovered one more key to unlock the mysteries of the universe." The announcement was received with cheers during a joint seminar at CERN and the ICHEP Conference in Melbourne, Australia.
 The results came from experiments using the largest machine ever built by mankind, the 27 kilometer-long Large Hadron Collider or LHC.
 Superconducting magnets that drive the collider are kept at 1.9 Kelvins, colder than outer space, and billions of protons traveling near the speed of light collide at the world record energy of 8 trillion electron volts.
 The energy of these collisions transforms into tiny subatomic particles, which may never have been seen before and some of which live for only one-trillionth-of-one-trillionth of a second.
 The Compact Muon Solenoid is one of three detectors at the LHC that captures traces of these tiny particles. It is, in essence, a 14,000-ton camera the size of a four-story office building that almost completely surrounds one section of the collider and takes up to 40 million pictures every second.
 Purdue scientists and students contributed to the design and construction of several key parts of the CMS camera, the software used to operate camera and analyze the collisions, and have contributed to a variety of key measurements with the data.
 Bortoletto and Shipsey led the camera design and assembly teams. Purdue physics professors Virgil Barnes and Laszlo Gutay contributed key design features to two major components of the detector: the Hadron calorimeters, which detect showers of particles coming from high energy quarks; and the Muon detectors, which detect heavy relatives of the electron.
 Bortoletto also is the upgrade coordinator of the U.S. CMS and is responsible for coordinating the 47 U.S. universities working to upgrade the CMS camera.
 In addition, Purdue physics professors Matthew Jones, David Miller and Norbert Neumeister are part of the international CMS team, and 20 other Purdue personnel, including engineers, scientists, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduates have participated in the experiment.
 Neumeister, with close collaboration from Purdue's information technology group, also is contributing to the global distributed computing system that analyzed the data from the experiments.
 The Purdue CMS "Tier 2" data storage and processing center is the largest one of its kind among U.S. universities. Bortoletto has been involved in several of the analyses searching for the Higgs boson, and Neumeister and Shipsey have been involved in the internal reviewing process.
 Higgs bosons, if they exist, are short-lived and quickly decay into other particles. Because scientists cannot look directly for the particle, its discovery relies on observations of excess amounts of the particles into which it can decay.
 However, just as making change for a one-dollar bill can be done using different combinations of coins, Higgs bosons can decay into different combinations of particles.
 Bortoletto's group looked for evidence of specific subatomic particles that would result from one possible decay of a Higgs boson.

(Image courtesy of CERN)Download Photo To avoid any possible bias while analyzing new data and ensure objectivity when looking for much sought-after signs of new physics, physicists draw "blinds" over the region where an excess of decay events is expected, Bortoletto said.
 This region is only "unblinded" when they are satisfied enough with their procedures to give confidence in the ultimate result. 
 "The moment the analysis was unblinded was amazing," Bortoletto said. "The excess at 125.3 GeV was easy to see, and we felt as though a major discovery was appearing in front of us.
 The statistical significance achieved was enough to be classified as a discovery. The probability of the background alone fluctuating by this amount is one in three million.
" CMS reported observations consistent with expectations for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The results were found with a statistical significance of 4.9 sigma, a unit of standard deviation, which means scientists are 99.99997 percent certain of the discovery.
 The Standard Model of particle physics describes the basic building blocks of matter and their interactions, and its explanations of elementary particles and forces have held true through more than four decades of experimental testing.
 The Higgs boson remains the only missing piece of the model and, without it the critical component of how these particles obtain mass cannot be explained.
 "The Standard Model Higgs would tidily complete the Standard Model of particles and forces," Barnes said. "However, the very precise and successful Standard Model does not explain all that we have observed.
" It does not give us guidance on how to unify gravity with the other known forces of nature, explain why there are exactly three pairs of quarks and three generations of leptons or explain why the third generations are some ten-thousand times heavier than the first generations, he said.
 "There are some very appealing theories involving a whole host of new particles, some of which we are really hoping to find at the LHC," Barnes said.
 "It is not impossible that our new particle could be, for example, one of the postulated supersymmetric Higgses." The Higgs boson is named after Peter Higgs, a professor of physics at the University of Edinburgh, who first suggested the particle as the mechanism that gives mass to matter.
 Shipsey was a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh and attended classes taught by Higgs. This announcement was the first time Shipsey had seen Higgs in 20 years.
 "Peter was a brilliant teacher and all the students were in awe of him," Shipsey said. "However, he is an extremely modest person and is somewhat embarrassed that the particle carries his name.
 It was wonderful to see him again and share this moment with him." The LHC continues to deliver new data at an impressive rate. By the end of 2012, CMS hopes to have more than triple its total current data sample.
 These data will enable CMS to further elucidate the nature of this newly observed particle. They will also allow CMS to extend the reach of their many other searches for new physics, Bortoletto said.

 Purdue plans professorship in honor of Lechtenberg
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University President France A. Córdova has announced a challenge match to endow a professorship in honor of Victor Lechtenberg, the university's former vice provost for engagement.
 "Purdue is known throughout the world as an engaged university thanks to the efforts of Vic Lechtenberg," Córdova said. "Vic has worked tirelessly to spur economic development in Indiana and help find answers to global challenges.
" Gifts from donors for the professorship will be matched dollar for dollar by the university. The goal is to raise money for the endowment over the next three years as Lechtenberg phases into retirement.
 "This professorship will raise the profile of scholarly work being done in engagement throughout the state, the nation and the world," Córdova said.
 The professorship will be part of the Faculty Fund for Excellence, announced by Córdova last winter. The program is raising private gifts that are matched by up to $7.25 million in university funds designated for faculty investment.
 Gifts from $750,000 to $1 million are matched dollar for dollar. Lechtenberg currently is special assistant to the president and director of the Center for Regional Development.
 He joined the Purdue faculty in 1971 as a professor of agronomy. He taught crop science and conducted research on forage and biomass crops until 1982.
 From 1982-1993, Lechtenberg served as associate director of agricultural research programs and as executive associate dean of agriculture.
 He was dean of Purdue Agriculture from 1993-2004. From 2004-2011, Lechtenberg served as vice provost for engagement, a position that was established in 2001.
 He was interim provost from 2007-2008, and from 2008-2009 was interim vice president for governmental relations. Lechtenberg served as chair of the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture's national Agricultural Research, Extension, Education and Economics Advisory Board from 1996-2002. In that capacity, he provided written testimony on biosecurity for the U.S.
 Senate. He is a Fellow of the American Society of Agronomy and the Crop Science Society of America. He is a past president of the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, an organization of 30 scientific societies and associations relating to agriculture.
 In recognition of his impact on the state of Indiana, Lechtenberg received the Indiana Economic Development Corporation's (IEDC) 2009 Accelerate Indiana Award.
 He was recognized as the IEDC's best resource for connecting Indiana's strong academic culture with that of the business world. 
In April, Lechtenberg received the Morrill Award, given by Purdue for careers that have demonstrated excellence in teaching, research and engagement missions.
 The Office of Engagement puts Purdue resources to work to address issues affecting the state, nation and world's prosperity and quality of life.
 Areas of focus include economic development, P-12 education, community service and lifelong learning.

 Purdue police offer help, resources when needed
 We at the Purdue University Police Department welcome students back to campus and wish you a great and safe academic year. Safety is the foundation that makes it possible for students to excel and enjoy their time on campus, and it's our job to help provide that environment.
 Here are a few suggestions to keep in mind: * When you have to walk at night, select well-lit areas where other people are present as much as possible and never walk in secluded areas, such as alleys.
 * CityBus is a great transportation option. It's free, and routes are designed to take you close to where you need to be. * Always have your keys in hand when approaching your car or card in hand as you approach your residence hall.
 * Stay with your group at parties. "Go on without me, I’ll be fine," is not good personal policy. * Lock your room or apartment doors when you leave, even if you're going to be gone for only a few minutes.
 * Don't leave valuables in your car where other people can see them, even if the vehicle is locked. It's best to place them in the trunk.
 We have a department of 40 police officers. In addition, we work with a team of students just like you who are part of the Purdue Student Security Patrol.
 They are an invaluable asset to the department and our campus. We urge you to take advantage of the many university resources available.
 For instance, the Purdue Student Security Patrol's Safe Walk program provides escorts around campus 24 hours a day, seven days a week by calling 765-494-SAFE (7233).
 We also offer classes in self-defense and work with the residence halls on educational programs. Also, don't forget to register your bikes and computers with the Purdue Police Department to aid in recovery efforts if they are lost or stolen.
 Lastly, never hesitate to call. If you ever find yourself in a situation in which you're not comfortable and want immediate assistance, call 911.
 If you have tips or suggestions, talk to an officer you see on campus or call our anonymous tipline at 765-496-3784 or the WeTip hotline at 1-800-78 CRIME (1-800-782-7463).
 These hotlines are available around the clock. Please take a moment to visit the Purdue Police Department's website at http://www.purdue.edu/police/
. There, you will find updated information on police activities, a range of tips and resources available to you to keep you safe, and more.
 John Cox is the Purdue University police chief. The Purdue Police Department is accredited by the Commission for Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies - CALEA - the nation's largest law enforcement accrediting organization.

 Purdue prepares funding request for state
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The Finance Committee of the Purdue Board of Trustees on Thursday (Aug. 23) approved the university's 2013-15 legislative request for operating appropriations and line item requests to support several university programs and initiatives.
 The request is based on instructions issued by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education and the State Budget Agency and is tied to performance metrics - primarily related to student success and cost reduction - established by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education.
 Under the ICHE plan, a pool of funds would be created by reducing institutions' operating appropriations - 6 percent for 2013-14 and an additional 1 percent for 2014-15 – and then reallocating those funds based on performance.
 Based on the performance metric values as defined by ICHE, Purdue is requesting $313.4 million in operating appropriations system-wide, up $1.1 million, a 0.3 percent increase over the 2012 fiscal year appropriation level.
 Purdue West Lafayette's performance made it eligible to receive more than what would be withheld from its operating appropriations.
 "Purdue supports the state's effort to increase graduation rates and reduce costs," said acting President Timothy Sands. "Purdue has exceeded goals such as degree completion, and even more notably, completion of what the state defines as high-impact degrees.
 "We have a range of programs in place to ensure that students are well prepared upon arrival and supported once they are on campus.
 These programs help our students earn a quality degree in a timely way, reduce overall costs and increase returns on the state's investment.
" The state is also asked to continue funding for programs and initiatives Purdue oversees for Indiana. These line item appropriations include: 
 Technical Assistance Program (TAP): TAP advances Indiana's economy and the health and quality of life of its residents. TAP supports performance improvement in Indiana companies, health-care providers and governmental units through various programs and services that utilize faculty, students and staff in nine statewide offices.
 Since 1986 TAP has had more than a $1 billion impact on Indiana. Funding request: $4.5 million, up $2.6 million. Almost all of the increase would be used to create an Office of High Performance Government, which would provide technical support to local governments to help them streamline operations.
 This is in response to the 2007 Kernan-Shepard "Streamlining Local Government" report. Agricultural Research and Extension (Crossroads):
 This supports applied research and education for problems and emerging issues specific to Indiana agriculture. These funds are leveraged by federal and competitive funds at the rate of $8 for every $1 of state funding.
 The funding supports the state's Plant and Pest Diagnostic Laboratory and Purdue Agricultural Centers across the state, providing venues for site-specific research and Extension education programs.
 Funding request: $10.23 million, an increase of $3 million to support investments in Indiana plant and animal agriculture and rural entrepreneurship.
 The state investment has not increased since 1998. County Extension Educators: Working in every county in the state, they provide unbiased research-based knowledge to Hoosiers.
 Funding request: $7.6 million, up $400,000 to cover inflation. Statewide Technology: The Purdue College of Technology's statewide education delivery system is a partnership among regional/community education, industry and government.
 The program meets Indiana's need for trained technologists and technicians; provides the means for workers to update their education while still on the job; and offers degree options for recent high school graduates who can't attend the West Lafayette or regional campuses.
 Funding requested: $7.1 million, up $700,000. A portion of the increase would be non-recurring and would establish regional engagement hubs; transfer scholarships for Ivy Tech students; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) experiences in K-12 classrooms.
 Center for Paralysis Research: Based in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the center focuses on research into traumatic neurological injury and subsequent treatment.
 Funding request: $544,217, up $21,659 to cover inflation. Indiana Next Generation Manufacturing Competitiveness Center: Based on a partnership among Purdue, Ivy Tech Community College and Vincennes University,
 the new center would attract, retain and grow the state's high-value manufacturing industries. In collaboration with the state, Indiana companies, and small- and medium-sized manufacturers, the center would provide access to state-of-the art knowledge and practices in manufacturing processes, metrology, materials, systems and information sciences.
 The university is requesting $10 million to establish this center. In addition, the university is asking that the state continue its support for research, based on a formula that would be developed by the commission.
 The state's investment in the previous biennium was $6.1 million, helping make Purdue more competitive for sponsored research grants.
 The funding helps Purdue provide startup packages to attract top researchers and covers costs related to laboratories, fellowships and postdoctoral researchers, and related system or staff infrastructure.
 Purdue has doubled its annual research expenditures to $600 million since 2006-07. At the same time, new sponsored program awards totaled $420 million for 2010-11 - most of them research-related.
 The appropriation request also includes $44.3 million for debt service, an increase of $12.5 million. Also known as fee replacement, debt service represents funds replaced by the state when student fees are pledged against university debt service costs associated with certain academic facilities.
 The university also requests $18.5 million to help with the repair and rehabilitation of buildings, laboratories and classrooms.
 The general fund, which supports the academic enterprise, is $1.22 billion for 2012-13. Of that, the state operating appropriation funded $312 million while student fees accounted for more than $764 million.
 The total budget for Purdue's four campuses and 10 College of Technology Statewide locations for 2012-13 is $2.32 billion. Besides the general fund, it includes revenue from federal grants, gifts from alumni and corporations, student aid, auxiliary enterprises, indirect cost reimbursement payments on sponsored research, and earnings on the university's endowment.
 Purdue's appropriation request will be submitted to the Indiana Commission for Higher Education, which will then forward the request to the General Assembly for consideration during its legislative session.

 Purdue president to graduates: Seek opportunities, embrace change 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Congratulations, graduates! This is a special day for you, for your families and friends, and for all of us at Purdue who have watched you grow your skills, experience, confidence and aspirations during your time here.
 College is indeed a time of transformation. If you don't think you've changed that much, just ask your families. I'm sure they've marveled at how you've developed intellectually and socially since they waved good-bye and drove away from campus that first year.
 For those of you who are earning your baccalaureate degrees this summer, your earliest days at Purdue may seem long ago. You probably sat in this same hall at Boiler Gold Rush wondering whether you would be able to fulfill the rigors of college and meet the high standard of excellence that is Purdue.
 The anxious young freshmen who sat here several years ago have grown, and today we celebrate as you become the future leaders of our communities and corporations, of our academic institutions, and our government agencies.
 We also commemorate our proud graduate students whose hard work has earned them master's, doctorate and professional degrees. You came here wondering if you could be the great thinkers that your advisers wanted you to be - could you keep up with your peers?
 What if they found out what you were really like? I think nearly every student goes through the Imposter Syndrome for at least a little while.
 But the Purdue experience has changed you, too. You've mastered your chosen areas of study. You've created new knowledge, made significant advancements through your research, and helped design useful tools that will assist others.
 Emily Cook has earned a Master of Science in biomedical engineering. Her work at Purdue will help amputees control their prosthetic devices through a miniaturized, radio-frequency-powered, implantable electrode that speaks to targeted muscle sites.
 Arthur Chlebowski, also in biomedical engineering, has earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree. He has designed a device that one day may continuously monitor the intraocular pressure of the eye.
 This will give ophthalmologists better tools for diagnosing and monitoring patients with glaucoma, a disease that is expected to affect nearly 80 million people worldwide over the next 10 years.
 Among you may be a best-selling novelist, a hotel manager, an inspirational teacher, a compassionate nurse, a cyberforensics genius, or a crop scientist who will help farmers around the world gain greater yields from land that struggles to produce.
 All of our graduates today have learned new levels of confidence, independence and responsibility. These leadership skills weren't all gained in the classroom.
 Many were learned in the organizations you joined, the athletic teams you participated in, and the volunteer time you gave to our community.
 Your confidence also came from the enduring love and support of your friends and family. Let's bring up the house lights so you can wave to your parents, siblings, grandparents, and friends and thank them for all they've done for you during your Purdue years.
 Some of you may have noticed that I've been through a few changes of my own lately. Less than a month ago, I was Provost Sands; today, I am honored to be entrusted with the responsibility of acting president for this extraordinary institution.
 I've also been an undergraduate, a graduate student, an industrial researcher, a professor, a graduate student adviser (in fact, two of my students are receiving their doctoral hoods today), a research center director, and, perhaps my most important role, the parent of college students - all Boilermakers, by the way - two graduated, two still here.
 As I've moved through the changes of each new role, I've picked up a few tips that I'd like to share with you on this special day:
 You have been taught and mentored by some of the finest faculty in the world. Internalize the skills and traits that you found effective in them and apply them to your own life.
 Whether you are going on to a faculty position at another university, starting a company, or joining a Fortune 500 corporation, you can always draw useful information from the people around you.
 I encourage you to watch and learn from others who are more experienced, and remember, someday, young people will be learning from you.
 The researchers in the audience know what I'm talking about when I say that sometimes you need to be very patient before you're able to reach your ultimate goal.
 When it comes to your career, it may take a while before you find work that interests you fully. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the average person born in the latter years of the baby boom - that's 1957 to 1964 - held 11 jobs from ages 18-44.
 That's 11 jobs in 26 years. That's a lot of changing - and a lot of opportunities. We expect that your generation will change jobs just as much, if not more.
 But although change is sometimes tough, or even scary, every new position can be viewed as a step closer to something you really want to do or an opportunity to make a greater impact.
 You might graduate from a college that begins with, for example, the letter "P." Then you might go on to earn a law degree and become a corporate leader somewhere in Indiana.
 Perhaps then you'll lead a federal government agency and work for the president of the United States. You might go from there to become the governor of a great Midwestern state - maybe even Indiana again.
 And, then, who knows, someday you might even end up as the president of another university with a name that coincidentally also begins with the letter "P" and happens to be the greatest institution in the entire country.
 It could really happen! Through your life, each step, over time, will lead you closer to something you will love to do - something you were meant to do - something that will make a bigger difference.
 Be patient and seek the opportunities as they present themselves. And when a door opens for you and your immediate reaction is: The opportunity is too early, too much of a jump or not in the original plan, think twice before saying, "No, thanks.
" Don't be afraid to jump in over your head, repeatedly. It leads to personal growth. It helps you refine what type of person you want to be and what you want to do with your career.
 It often leads to more money. Or you might even discover that money is not a major criterion for you, after all. Maybe for you it is autonomy or a sense of higher purpose, or the opportunity to master your field.
 And there is something else that is good about change: It is something you can count on. It will be a constant in your life. But as you do, remember one thing: No matter how many cities you live in or positions you hold, or how many times you completely change careers, one thing will never change.

 Purdue professors to advance breast cancer research partnership through trip to Ghana
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue professors Sophie A. Lelièvre and Ellen Gruenbaum will travel to Africa this month to meet with officials of Peace and Love Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, and outline ways to advance a partnership on breast cancer research and awareness.
Lelièvre, associate professor of basic medical sciences in the School of Veterinary Medicine and associate director of Discovery Groups for the Purdue Center for Cancer Research, also will deliver a keynote lecture on international efforts to prevent breast cancer development to a panel of African health and public policy experts on Monday (Jan.
 16) in Kumasi."The incidence of breast cancer has risen rapidly in many African countries, and the World Health Organization is asking scientists from around the world to help shift efforts from detection toward primary prevention," said Lelièvre (pronounced Le-LEE-YEA-vre).
 "That's because many developing countries will not be able to withstand the costs associated with the necessary heavy treatments, especially since women usually consult at advanced stages of the disease.
"Lelièvre and Gruenbaum, with support from the Purdue Global Policy Research Institute, are researching how legal and cultural aspects impact policy decisions in terms of breast health in countries such as Ghana, Lebanon, France, Japan and Uruguay.
Gruenbaum, a medical anthropologist and head of the Department of Anthropology, also will work on establishing a collaboration to study cultural and religious practices affecting breast health and dietary patterns.
"Many African women are dying from breast cancer mainly because of a lack of understanding about the disease's early symptoms and beliefs about the effects of breast cancer," Gruenbaum said.
 "While the country's fatality rate from breast cancer is 10th highest in Africa, Ghanaian health-care officials and government leaders are working aggressively to raise awareness and educate women about how lives can be saved from early screening and treatment.
"During their visit to Ghana, Lelièvre and Gruenbaum will meet with African breast cancer awareness leader Dr. Beatrice Wiafe-Addai, chief executive officer of Peace and Love Hospital.
 Wiafe-Addai also serves as president of Breast Care International, a non-governmental organization in Ghana, and has received several awards for her breast cancer awareness efforts.
In addition, Wiafe-Addai chairs the Susan G. Komen Ghana Race for the Cure and the Ghana Breast Cancer Alliance and is vice president of the African Organization for Research and Training in Cancer Council for West Africa, known as AORTIC.
An estimated 450,000 women die from breast cancer every year in Ghana, and about 5 million of its 22 million people are at high risk for the disease, said Lelièvre, who also is a member of the Oncological Sciences Center in Purdue's Discovery Park.
Lelièvre and Connie Weaver, distinguished professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue, are leading a multinational initiative called the International Breast Cancer and Nutrition Project (IBCN) to learn more about the role that diet and other environmental factors can play to promote or prevent this disease.
IBCN, involving the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, is focusing initial efforts on the United States and Ghana as well as France, Japan, Uruguay and Lebanon.
Through the project launched in 2010, each country has a dedicated research team focused on a number of milestones and allows scientists to study worldwide diversity in breast cancer rates, dietary patterns and cultural contexts.
The project is bringing together experts in nutrition, basic medical sciences, statistics, cancer epidemiology, communication, public policy, economics, health law, anthropology and medicine to study a variety of factors such as how cellular mechanisms in breast cancer development link to diet, as well as the role public policy plays in a population's available food source and disease prevention.
Lelièvre said another important objective is to identify the link between different types of breast cancer, nutrition and the epigenome, the latter of which determines how the genome is organized within cells to control the on-and-off switch of genes.
The IBCN's annual conference returns to the Purdue campus this fall, following the 2011 event in France. Lebanon is scheduled to host the conference in 2013.
 Purdue hosted the inaugural conference in October 2010.Purdue's Global Policy Research Institute focuses on the university's strengths in science, information technology, data management and systems engineering in collaboration with economics and the social sciences to inform policymakers about critical issues such as food security and health.
The institute has awarded $300,000 in grants to help Purdue professors establish seed projects to attract external funding for larger projects.
 Some of the supported topics include food security, disaster recovery, cancer prevention and sustainability. Writer: Phillip Fiorini, 765-496-3133, pfiorini@purdue.edu

 Purdue ranked among top universities in nation
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University maintained its top 25 ranking among the nation's public universities and is 65th among all universities, according to U.S.News & World Report.
 Purdue ranked 23rd among public universities, in a tie with Texas A&M University, and was 65th overall, tied with Texas A&M and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
 Last year, Purdue was ranked 23rd among public universities and 62nd overall. The university was ranked 11th overall and eighth among public universities in "up-and-comers" for "the most promising and innovative changes in the areas of academics, faculty and student life," as determined by a survey of college administrators.
 Purdue was again acknowledged in four of eight student success categories. The areas, in which schools are listed but not ranked, are First-Year Experience, Writing in the Disciplines, Learning Communities and Internships.
 "These rankings and acknowledgements reflect the strong emphasis we have placed on student success," said Timothy Sands, Purdue's acting president.
 "With the efforts of faculty and staff, we continue to make strides in improving the academic experience of all our students." Purdue also was cited in "The Foreign Student Factor," a category of universities with a significant number of international undergraduate students.
 "It is gratifying to be acknowledged for our progress in ensuring that students who come to Purdue are successful," said Vic Lechtenberg, acting provost and chief academic officer.
 "It also is significant that our College of Engineering and Krannert School of Management continue to be recognized among the nation's best programs.
" Purdue's College of Engineering and Krannert School of Management earned overall rankings of 10th and 21st, respectively, and both had highly ranked specialty programs.
 The College of Engineering was 10th nationally among doctoral-granting universities, tied with Princeton University and the University of Texas, down from ninth last year.
 In engineering specialties, Purdue retained its top ranking in biological/agricultural, was fourth in aerospace/aeronautical and tied for fourth in industrial.
 Purdue University Calumet was ranked 44th, in a tie with three other universities, among engineering schools whose highest degree is a bachelor's or master's.
 The Krannert School of Management tied for 21st with Pennsylvania State University and the University of Maryland, up from 24th in 2011.
 In management specialties, Purdue ranked third in production/operations management and fifth in quantitative analysis/methods. In specialty rankings, only the top five are now available.
 Extended specialty rankings are scheduled to be released at a later date. The data for determining the nation's best institutions of higher education come from questionnaires U.S.News sends to all accredited four-year colleges and universities.
 The magazine then determines its rankings based on measures that fall into seven broad categories: assessment by administrators at peer institutions; retention of students; faculty resources; student selectivity; financial resources; alumni giving; and "graduation rate performance," the difference between the proportion of students expected to graduate and those who actually do.
 U.S.News bases its specialty rankings on a spring 2012 survey of deans and department heads at peer institutions. The programs receiving the most votes are listed.
 U.S.News' college guidebook, "America's Best Colleges," contains a directory of the more than 1,400 institutions. Information on the rankings can be found at the U.S.News & World Report website at
 http://www.usnews.com/ More on Purdue's past U.S.News and other rankings is available at http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/rankings/index.html

 Purdue recognizes professors who make solutions to everyday problems across the world
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University is highlighting four professors who are creating solutions to everyday problems across the world.
 The researchers' work includes providing transportation to third-world villages in Cameroon; enabling African farmers to protect their crops; creating minute medical sensors that can prevent and monitor health issues; and a device that enables Parkinson’s disease sufferers to speak louder and more clearly.
 Purdue Marketing and Media created a website that includes photos and additional information about the professors and research programs.
 The webpage can be accessed at http://www.purdue.edu/differencemakers/creativity.html *Jessica Huber, associate professor of speech, language and hearing sciences.
 Nearly 90 percent of Parkinson’s patients suffer from a neurological disorder known as “soft voice,” which makes the words they speak sound hushed, whispery or hoarse.
 Huber has invented SpeechVive, a device that cues Parkinson’s patients to speak louder and clearer. The device rests in a patient’s ear and provides a stream of noise similar to the background chatter at a party while the patient speaks.
 That cues that person to talk louder, a response known as the Lombard effect. The first clinical trial was positive, and the device could reach the market by 2013.
 *John Lumkes, professor of agriculture and biological engineering. Lumkes is the technical adviser for a group of Purdue students who traveled to Cameroon to provide affordable and practical transportation to the underdeveloped area.
 Purdue’s Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering partnered with The African Centre for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technologies (ACREST) in 2009 to develop a basic utility vehicle that is low-cost, durable, adaptable and easily manufactured from materials readily available in that area.
 Each year a group of Purdue students create a prototype tested through 3-D modeling software and extensive field runs before visiting Cameroon for three weeks to build the vehicle.
 *Larry Murdock, professor of entomology. Murdock developed the Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage system, allowing farmers in West and Central Africa to protect their harvest of cowpeas.
 The farmers use their crops for income and to feed their families, but many are fighting a losing battle with weevil infestations that destroy grain during storage.
 Murdock’s system entails cowpeas being triple-bagged in polyethylene and polypropylene containers, which are light, affordable, easy to use and readily available.
 *Babak Ziaie, electrical and computer engineer. Ziaie has created a prototype of a minute medical sensor that can be implanted into the body to monitor aneurysms or treat people with incontinence.
 The new acoustically charged sensor can monitor pressure in the urinary bladder and in the sack of a blood vessel damaged by an aneurysm.
 In the future the sensor may slow incontinence in people with paralysis by checking bladder pressure and stimulating the spinal cord to close a sphincter that controls urine flow from the bladder.
 The new sensor provides benefit over previous implantable technologies that require batteries or receive power through “induction” coils and an external transmitter, both of which can cause maintenance problems.

 Purdue Research Park recognizes 50 years of innovation and job creation
 Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels speaks during Tuesday's (June 12) 50th anniversary celebration of the Purdue Research Park. Seated, from left, are France A.
 Córdova, Purdue University president; John Dennis, West Lafayette mayor; and Joseph B. Hornett, senior vice president, treasurer and COO of the Purdue Research Foundation.
 The event capped off a yearlong celebration that began in July 2011.Download Photo INDIANAPOLIS; WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.; MERRILLVILLE, Ind.; and NEW ALBANY, Ind.
 - Purdue Research Park concluded its yearlong 50th anniversary celebration with an event that recognized the leaders and innovations that helped make the park the country's largest university-affiliated incubation complex.
 More than 200 people attended Tuesday's (June 12) event. Purdue Research Park now has four locations across Indiana and 200 companies that employ more than 4,000 people.
 When established in 1961, the Purdue Research Park was the third such park established in the United States. Stanford Research Park was founded in 1951, and the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina followed in 1959.
 As part of the 50th anniversary, Purdue Research Park had an independent study compiled by Thomas P. Miller and Associates. The study reports:
 * $49 million in federal research and development grants for small businesses brought to the state since 1987. * High-tech, high-quality jobs paying an average annual salary of $63,000 - 65 percent higher than the Indiana average.
 "Purdue University and the Purdue Research Park in particular, are huge engines for the state of Indiana," said Gov. Mitch Daniels, who spoke at the event.
 "First-rate research, with a goal of creating innovative goods and services, is an indispensable element of any state's economic success, and the Purdue Research Park is Indiana's flagship asset in this realm.
" Through joint efforts among the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, Purdue Research Park and local officials, several companies relocated to Indiana, including Scale Computing Inc.
 from San Francisco, WindStream Technologies Inc. from southern California and the Dow AgroSciences Seed Quality Control Lab from Iowa.
 The Purdue Research Park is a prime locator for Purdue University faculty researchers who wish to commercialize their discoveries.
 "The park is a key factor in the successful commercialization of Purdue discoveries, and there are nearly 70 Purdue faculty directly involved in new companies based in the Purdue Research Park," said Purdue President France A.
 Córdova. "These companies' products are primarily based on Purdue discoveries, and there are countless other faculty who have licensed their discoveries to a park-based company or help park companies with research and consulting assistance.
" * Cook Biotech Inc., a Cook Group Inc. subsidiary that manufactures BioDesign™ advanced tissue-repair products. "This has been a historic year for the Purdue Research Park, and it has been a year of tremendous growth," said Joseph B.
 Hornett, senior vice president, treasurer and COO of the Purdue Research Foundation, which manages the park network. "We've had nearly 25 new and expanding companies join the park network in the past year from many sectors, including life sciences, agroscience, cybersecurity and manufacturing.
 All of these companies are doing important work that addresses the global challenges of our world." New and expanding companies that joined the park in the 2011-12 fiscal year include Advion BioSciences, which conducts pharmaceutical research; CACI, a firm that specializes in cybersecurity for governmental agencies; Cornerstone Autism Center, a center that helps children and families dealing with autism; Dow AgroSciences Seed Quality Control Lab, a seed research facility for Dow AgroSciences Inc.
 "Our community is fortunate to have the Purdue Research Park," said West Lafayette Mayor John Dennis. "The park provides a strong foundation for economic development, both in the high-tech jobs it creates within the park boundaries and throughout our entire community.
" A 2011 Battelle study on university-affiliated research parks reports that every job in a park creates 2.57 jobs in its respective community.
 The Purdue Research Park has been recognized by state, national and international organizations. In 2010 the National Business Incubation Association honored the Purdue Research Park Entrepreneurship Academy with the Incubator Innovation Award.
 In 2008 the International Economic Development Council presented three first-place awards for excellence in economic development in the areas of entrepreneurship, partnerships with educational institutions and technology-based economic development.
 In 2004 the Association of University Research Parks (AURP) recognized the Purdue Research Park with its top Outstanding Science and Research Park Award.
 The Purdue Research Park has the largest university-affiliated business incubation program in the country. The park's four Indiana sites are in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.
 The nearly 200 companies located in the park network employ about 4,000 people.

 Purdue research supports key element of concussion lawsuit
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Ongoing Purdue University research into football players' brains bolsters one element of a lawsuit by former NFL players against the league: Repetitive blows to the head produce subconcussive injury and increase the risk of long-term brain damage and cognitive decline.
 The Purdue Neurotrauma Group first gained national attention in 2010 for its work in studying the brains of high school players.
 But the research, which first focused on the effects of concussions, now shows something even more disturbing: More than half the players who never suffered concussions experience neurophysiological changes to their brain that often affects cognitive abilities.
 "I don't know what the NFL said or didn't say to its players, but fMRI exams repeatedly tell this truth: Repeated blows to players' heads change the way their brains function for the worse," said Tom Talavage, a Purdue professor of biomedical engineering.
 "We may be putting too much focus on concussions. That is only the final straw after thousands of hits over several years." The early research was featured in Sports Illustrated, NBC Nightly News, CNN and PBS Frontline.
 Over three seasons the researchers have used sensors in helmets to document every blow to each player's head. Players take cognitive exams and fMRIs before, during and after the season.
 The researchers have been consulting with high school and college athletic associations to improve safety through better coaching, rules and officiating.
 They have also developed new helmet technologies that dramatically reduce the G-force transferred to the brain. "Football helmets are designed to protect the skull and the face, not the brain," said Eric Nauman, a Purdue professor of biomedical engineering.
 "We can build a better helmet, but we are probably going to have to find ways to reduce the number of times boys and young men subject their brains to massive G-forces.

 Purdue researcher helps robots 'see' in 3-D like humans
 Zygmunt Pizlo, Purdue professor in the Department of Psychological Sciences, stands between postdoctoral research assistants Tadamasa Sawada and Yunfeng Li, as he adjusts the vision of a robot named &#268;apek.
 The researchers will move around the dance floor in Pizlo’s laboratory while the robot "watches.” The goal is to stimulate visual perception in the robot so it can "see" more like humans.
 (Photo provided by Purdue Research Foundation) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Zygmunt Pizlo and his research team glide across a parquet dance floor - not in some club for a night on the town, but in his Purdue University 
Visual Perception Lab as part of critical research for a technology that is ready to be licensed and commercialized. They're moving so a robot named &#268;apek can "watch" them and conceptualize the research team's actions as members move around objects like desks and chairs.
 The goal is to simulate visual perception in the robot so it can "see" more like humans. "Enabling robots and other machines to see the world in 3-D like humans is one of the biggest challenges in robotics and artificial intelligence," said Pizlo, a professor in the Purdue Department of Psychological Sciences.
 "Research in the field of robotic vision has typically focused on recording and analyzing 2-D images, but really it is about 3-D visual perception - being able to understand the 3-D scene in front of the robot so that it can decide what needs to be done with an object that is in its field of view.
 Should the robot walk around it? Pick it up?" "We believe there is a fundamental principle for human vision and that is we rely on a prior knowledge about a physical environment, so we're trying to program this knowledge of the physical environment into a robot's artificial intelligence," he said.
 "We're developing a technology that will allow robotic machines to map their environment using two cameras for eyes," he said. "This process eliminates the need for additional range sensors currently used for robotic vision and reduces the time and complexity of robotic sight.
" Postdoctoral research assistants Tadamasa Sawada and Yunfeng Li are working with Pizlo. Sawada said humans have the ability for cognitive functions that are computationally difficult, and it is a challenge to incorporate that ability into a robot.
 View of Zygmunt Pizlo, Purdue professor in the Department of Psychological Sciences, and postdoctoral research assistants Tadamasa Sawada and Yunfeng Li, demonstrating how a robot “sees” them moving across a dance floor in Pizlo’s laboratory.
 (Photo provided by Purdue Research Foundation) "We quickly and easily perceive the physical world - a 3-D shape and figure-ground organization," Sawada said.
 "Figure-ground organization is key to seeing an object in 3-D instead of 2-D." Figure-ground perception is the tendency of a human's visual system to simplify a scene or photo into a main object and cognitively "move" everything else into the background.
 "The question is how do we have a robot solve figure-ground organization like we do?" he said. "We do this by incorporating visual mechanisms and a prior knowledge about the physical environment into a robot.
" Conventional robotic vision technology uses multiple cameras with laser range finders and other sensors to detect objects around them.
 While the current systems allow for basic object recognition, they do not replicate the 3-D capabilities that are possible for humans, according to Pizlo.
 "The key element in solving the puzzle of enabling 3-D vision for robots is to realize that our visual system uses a prior knowledge about the physical world.
 We are implementing this knowledge, as well as the visual mechanisms (algorithms) in a robot," said Pizlo, who also is a professor of electrical and computer engineering.
 "The physical world is not completely random. Most natural objects are symmetrical, all objects have volume, gravity is always present, ground surfaces are approximately horizontal.
 There is enough prior knowledge in the human visual system that we automatically see everything in 3-D. Combining a prior knowledge with visual information helps robots see the same way we do.
" "Right now robots are used in a number of ways, including manufacturing, space research, agriculture and even cleaning our floors, but they can't bring us coffee in the morning," he said.
 "Until they can see like us, they can't truly interact with us. Once they can interact with us they can begin doing all types of tasks such as drive a car, help surgeons in hospitals, assist the elderly, provide sight for the blind, replace people in high-risk situations like making repairs in a nuclear plant and, yes, bring us coffee in the morning.
" The patent-pending technology is available for licensing through Eric Lynch at 765-588-3477, eslynch@prf.org, in the Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization
. Funding for Pizlo' s research came from the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Defense, Air Force Office of Scientic Research, U.S.
 Department of Energy and other sources. The Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization operates one of the most comprehensive technology-transfer programs among leading research universities in the United States.
 Services provided by this office support the economic development initiatives of Purdue University and benefit the university's academic activities.

 Purdue scientists working to make drought-resistant crops
 Purdue scientists are working on several ways to develop crops that are drought-resistant and achieve maximum water-use efficiency to combat hot, dry conditions similar to those being experienced in Indiana this growing season.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University scientists are working in several areas in the hope that future dry spells don't have the same effects on crops as this year's drought.
 * Mitch Tuinstra, a professor and Wickersham Chair in agronomy, is studying tropical varieties of corn to understand which genes allow the plants to survive in hot, dry weather.
 The objective is to find ways to integrate those genes into corn that is bred to produce high yields in the Midwest. "There are all these other genes out there in these tropical gene pools.
 We are looking for those genes that enhance the adaptability of temperate maize," Tuinstra said. * Mike Mickelbart, an associate professor of horticulture, studies something similar to drought tolerance - water-use efficiency.
 The goal is to get the highest yields in corn using the least amount of water. "Our ultimate goal would be to provide plant breeders with genetic markers for water-use efficiency so they can incorporate this trait into their breeding programs," Mickelbart said.
 He said there are genes in corn that affect transpiration, a process in which pores called stomata open and close on a leaf surface and allow water to escape, like sweat on a person.
 His research is aimed at finding variations in those genes that affect the ability of a plant to use water as efficiently as possible.
 * Tony Vyn, a professor of agronomy, is evaluating drought-tolerant corn hybrids developed in the private sector. He is comparing their performance against conventional hybrids in different stress situations, including high plant density and situations in which nutrients are limited.
 A major part of Vyn's research involves determining whether optimum management practices for so-called drought-tolerant hybrids are different than for conventional hybrids currently in fields.
 "It really has to be the integration of genetics and best management practices so that we can get the most corn per gallon of water and per ounce of nutrient," he said.
 * The Purdue Center for Global Food Security focuses on education, research and development, and advocacy efforts to find solutions to world hunger.
 The center recently received a $5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to study ways to control the Striga weed, which infests sorghum and other crops in Africa.
 Center director Gebisa Ejeta, a distinguished professor of agronomy and 2009 World Food Prize laureate, is leading the research effort aimed at improving 
Striga-resistant sorghum that can tolerate drought conditions, said Gary Burniske, the center's managing director. Ejeta and others are testing plants this year in field plots.
 "We're looking for an increase in yield under droughty conditions in different types of soils with different nutrient availabilities," Burniske said.
 "It also has to be resistant to Striga, which is a terrible problem in Africa." More information about the drought is available at Purdue Extension's website at

 (Purdue University photo/Andrew Hancock) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University and Greater Lafayette area leaders on Monday (July 30) unveiled a new initiative to help individuals and businesses show support for the football team in a way that will enable the team and community to prosper.
 Purdue coach Danny Hope joined university and community leaders at the Tippecanoe County Courthouse to kick off Purdue SpiritMakers, a community-wide contest.
 The initiative encourages individuals and businesses throughout the football season to create displays showing Purdue spirit, with the goal of creating a greater sense of community.
 Prizes will be offered to contest winners. "As a football team, we aspire to be champions," Hope said. "We appreciate the tremendous support of Boilermaker Nation, and be assured that our players are motivated and inspired by the visible support shown from the community.
" Several Purdue cheerleaders raised a flag at the courthouse to promote the initial Boilermaker Revelry, which will run Aug. 13 through Sept.
 1. Additionally, individuals and businesses are encouraged to fly a Purdue flag on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of any home game.

(Purdue University photo/Andrew Hancock) Purdue Acting President Timothy Sands, Athletics Director Morgan Burke, Lafayette Mayor Tony Roswarski, West Lafayette Mayor John Dennis and Tippecanoe County Commissioner Tom Murtaugh participated in the event.
 People are encouraged to fly a Purdue flag through Sept. 1, and then on the Friday and Saturday of every home game weekend. As part of Purdue SpiritMakers, fans are encouraged to decorate homes or businesses to show their university spirit.
 "What better way to display support than with Purdue flags flying all over campus, all over the community, at all Boilermaker farms, all over the state, and for that matter, the nation and the world," Burke said.
 "Boilermaker Flag Revelry will annually remind us of how our great community and our great university embrace 40,000 young people to help them as they grow and learn so they can impact and lead our future.
 It also will signal the return of a great American tradition - college football, which allows 60,000-plus fans to come together as family to enjoy a daylong experience focused on family and some fun.
" A contest winner will be selected each week of a home football game decided by votes or "likes" through Facebook. A prize package consisting of tickets, food vouchers, a Follett's gift card and other prizes will be delivered to each winner on the Boilermaker Express, driven by the Purdue Reamer Club.
 Additionally, each winner will have a photo featured in a banner on the Purdue home page for four days surrounding the game. Murtaugh spoke about the economic impact the football team has on the Lafayette-West Lafayette community.
 Each home football game brings roughly 40,000 out-of-town visitors to the Greater Lafayette area, leading to an approximately $2.5 million impact, he said.
 The Purdue SpiritMakers contest is part of a greater effort to improve weekly buildup and overall fan experience at home football games.
 Several new action items will be implemented this year to accompany familiar returning activities. A pep rally will be held the Friday before each home game on the Purdue Memorial Union front lawn and will be open to students and the community.
 On Wednesday (Aug. 1) a new social media partnership with Lodestone will offer a rewards program for fans' involvement on social media.
 The Boiler Gold Rush Welcome Event will be Aug. 13 for incoming freshman and offer new students a chance to learn about school traditions and hear from coaches and administrators.
 The Boilermaker Bridge Walk will return this season and will be on Friday before each home game on the John T. Meyers Pedestrian Bridge spanning the Wabash River from Lafayette to West Lafayette.
 Also, fans can meet this year's Purdue team during a meet-and-greet event on Aug. 25 on the north end of the Ross-Ade Stadium plaza.
 Purdue opens the 2012 season on Sept. 1 against Eastern Kentucky in Ross-Ade Stadium. The Boilermakers finished last season with a 7-6 record after winning the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl in Detroit.
 Other home games will be on Sept. 15 (vs. Eastern Michigan), Sept. 29 (vs. Marshall), Oct. 6 (vs. Michigan), Oct. 13 (vs. Wisconsin), Nov.
 3 (vs. Penn State) and Nov. 24 (vs. Indiana). Details on all of the Purdue SpiritMakers initiatives and game-week activities can be found at

 Purdue students embark on women's cross-country air race
 Purdue student pilots Chantel Steele, at right, and Amanda Keck will fly a nearly 3000-mile course from Arizona to Ohio during the 2012 Air Race Classic.
 (Purdue University photo/Andrew Hancock) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Two female Purdue University students will take off Tuesday (June 19) from 
Lake Havasu, Ariz., in a small plane for a three-day race that crisscrosses the country before finishing in Batavia, Ohio. Captain Chantel Steele, a recent graduate from 
Iron Mountain, Mich., is returning to the women-only Air Race Classic after serving as co-pilot in a thunderstorm-battered 2011 race.
 "This year's route takes us through the mountains, so it is a little bit more dangerous," said Steele, who expects to contend with heat up to 114 degrees in Arizona.
 "This race is about empowering women - it's a liberating experience. You can see the world from a different perspective from the air.
" Co-pilot Amanda Keck, a junior from Crown Point, Ind., is looking forward to flying in the race that traces its heritage to Amelia Earhart and her pioneering contemporaries.
 "The first time I flew … I just loved it. When I went to the airport and saw the pilots, I looked up to them and wanted to do that," Keck said.
 "Even though the girls are showing themselves well in the flight area, it is still very dominated by men." Both women studied to be pilots in the College of Technology's flight technology program.
 They and their ground crew have been preparing for the 2,700-mile journey for months. The race gives them real-world experience, further preparing them for a career in aviation.
 They will be competing with women who have flown for decades. "Purdue's a very good flight school, so I've definitely gotten all my training that's necessary to fly," Keck said.
 "It should be pretty fun. As long as we do what we were taught to do we will be fine." Note to Journalists: Broadcast-quality B-roll and sound bites are available.

College of Technology students are hosting an open house for a rebuilt post-World War II, Lafayette, Ind., tract home after incorporating a myriad of 21st-century energy efficiency measures.
 The now environmentally friendly Deep Energy Retrofit model home at 2150 Ulen Street is open to public tours from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 every Saturday through July 28. The city of Lafayette purchased the foreclosed, distressed house in 2010, and Purdue students helped guide the process to gut the structure to the studs before rebuilding it with energy-efficient fixtures at every turn.
 Every crack or leak was sealed. New insulation was added to increase the exterior wall resistance to heat flow to a value of R-31 and the attic to R-61 (the higher the R-value the higher effectiveness of the insulation).
 Ductwork was sealed, and high-efficiency heating and cooling systems were installed, as were a heat-pump water heater and solar panels on the roof.
 Solar tubes were installed to bring natural light into windowless bathrooms. Purdue building construction management doctoral student Eric Holt was the construction manager for the student-built "INhome" that finished in second place nationally at the 2011 SolarDecathlon in Washington, D.C.
 He's been involved in the construction and now the education of homeowners and contractors about deep energy retrofits. "What we have shown with both houses is that highly efficient and eco-friendly living space can be created comfortably and affordably, often using off-the-shelf technology," Holt said.
 "We are encouraging people to visit this house in the Glen Acres Neighborhood so they can see how easily they can make improvements in their own homes.
" The team performed an energy audit before construction work began. Utility companies and some nonprofits often will do such an inspection that identifies a house for energy efficiency deficiencies for free or a nominal fee.
 The home includes multiple features, including Energy Star appliances, energy-efficient lighting, and low-flow plumbing fixtures, that are available at local hardware stores.
 "People who have taken the tour have their eyes opened to what is easily attainable and leave motivated to make positive changes," said Rob Henry, a Purdue building construction management student who hosts tours.
 An added third bedroom and an attached garage to the house to make it even more livable by modern expectations. The home will eventually be sold to a low- to moderate-income buyer, but Purdue researchers will continue to monitor the energy efficiency in this living laboratory.

 Purdue survey: Farmland purchases expected to continue
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Many farmland investors in Indiana and surrounding Corn Belt states plan to continue buying despite some concerns that the market might not be able to sustain recent, rapid price increases, according to a Purdue University agricultural economics study.
 Farmland values have risen considerably in the past decade nationwide, especially throughout the Corn Belt, including Indiana. The most productive farmland in Indiana doubled from 2004 to 2011, increasing from an average of $3,278 per acre to $6,521.
 From 2010 to 2011 alone, Indiana farmland values jumped by 22.8 percent. "The rapid increases have led some people to speculate that the farmland market is in a bubble," says Brent Gloy, professor of agricultural economics and director of Purdue's Center for Commercial Agriculture, which conducted the survey designed to gauge attitudes, beliefs and expectations of buyers.
 "Without knowing what investors really think of the market environment, we cannot adequately respond to that speculation. This study helps us answer questions about what's driving farmland prices.
" Nearly 250 farmers, farmland investors, agricultural lenders and agribusinesses responded to the survey, conducted in late February.
 Nearly half of the respondents said their operation was primarily in Indiana, with most of the remaining respondents owning farmland in surrounding Corn Belt states.
 Their median farmland ownership was 500 acres. Fifty-four percent of the respondents said they believed that the farmland market is in a bubble, although farmers with larger operations and more experience were less likely to be concerned about that than those with fewer acres and less experience.
 Still, 74 percent said they planned to buy additional land in the next five years. Asked to consider an 80-acre tract of farmland with a normal production capacity of 165 bushels of corn per acre, what respondents estimated they would pay for it varied widely, with the average at $6,179 per acre.
 "Some people are very positive about future values, and some have concerns," Gloy said. "Their wide range of possible prices is consistent with the current uncertainty surrounding the ultimate value of the farm.
 This variability of opinion creates the potential for large changes in farmland prices." Sixty-five percent of the respondents felt that someone else would pay more for the farmland than what the respondents themselves felt it was worth.
 Nearly all of the respondents believed that the amount of farmland for sale was less than normal or about the same as usual. Gloy said the findings indicate that the market is "still searching for equilibrium prices" after the dramatic crop price increases over the last decade.
 The limited amount of farmland for sale further complicates the situation. Market and economic conditions will determine where farmland values go in the future, but a key driver of current farmland prices is the purchasing capacity of the people willing to pay the most for land, according to Gloy.
 "Until the supply of land offered to the market increases, it is likely that the people at the upper end of the demand curve with more optimistic views of farmland value will continue to push prices higher," Gloy said.
 "How long this lasts will depend upon how these individuals' expectations evolve." Gloy will present more detailed study results July 11 at the 45th annual Top Farmer Crop Workshop in West Lafayette.
 The two-and-a-half day workshop will include experts addressing a variety of economic, agronomic and technological topics, such as managing risk, increasing workforce productivity and developing an on-farm research program.
 A complete agenda is available at http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/commercialag/progevents/topfarmer.html To learn more about the survey and data or to download the full report, "Farmland Value Expectations and Influences: Evidence from the Field," visit

 Purdue to celebrate Constitution Day
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University's celebration of Constitution Day on Monday (Sept. 17) will feature videos, exhibits and quiz shows aimed at educating American citizens about the freedoms they enjoy.
 Events will be from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in Purdue Memorial Union Room 118. The celebration is free and open to the public. Student teams and local celebrities will take part in three Jeopardy-style quiz-offs on the Constitution at 11:30 a.m.
, 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. outside Room 118. * Democracy Plaza, set up with whiteboards and social media such as Twitter, where participants can speak about social, political, economic and other issues relevant to the campus, city, state, country and world.
 * Online interactive games iCivics, which are simulations of a Supreme Court hearing and constitutional law firm. * A banned book exhibit, sponsored by Purdue University Libraries, displaying books that have been censored throughout history.
 * Showings of America Rock's "The Preamble," a classic cartoon treatment of the events leading up to the Constitution's signing.
 * A video of Justice Learning's "Conversations with Supreme Court Justices," featuring Justice Stephen Breyer and former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
 In 2004, Congress established Sept. 17 as Constitution Day. All federally funded schools are asked to develop educational programs to celebrate the Constitution.
 "The point we want to make everyone aware of is that no matter who you are, the Constitution has an impact in nearly every part of your life," said Phillip VanFossen, the Ackerman Professor of Social Studies Education and director of the James F.
 Ackerman Center for Democratic Citizenship. "It's something we all take for granted, and studies have shown that a vast majority of people don't know much about the document.
 Constitution Day gives schools a brief, yet important, chance to change this." The College of Education's Ackerman Center is coordinating the events, which are sponsored by the offices of the president and vice president for student services, Purdue Student Government and the Purdue Student Union Board.

 Purdue to move art gallery downtown
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The Greater Lafayette community will soon have easier access to the art in Purdue's Robert L. Ringel Gallery.
 University President France A Córdova on Tuesday (June 19) announced that the gallery will move from the Purdue Memorial Union to a downtown Lafayette location.
 The announcement was made during the Greater Lafayette Commerce breakfast held in her honor at the Holiday Inn Select. Córdova ends her term as Purdue's 11th president on July 15.
 "This vibrant cultural resource will soon be closer to the heart of the Lafayette-West Lafayette community," Córdova said. "In this way, not only will the public have more access, Purdue also will support the downtown area's efforts to serve as a cultural center.
" Purdue Galleries, in the Patti and Rusty Rueff School of Visual and Performing Arts, includes the Ringel Gallery, a second location in Stewart Center, and the Patti and Rusty Rueff Galleries in Pao Hall of Visual and Performing Arts.
 Ringel exhibits works by regional, national and international artists as well as items from the Purdue Galleries' permanent collection, with support from the College of Liberal Arts and assistance from Friends of the Galleries.
 The gallery's namesake served Purdue for four decades - as a professor and head of the Department of Audiology and Speech Sciences; dean of the School of Humanities, Social Sciences and Education; vice president and dean of the Graduate School; and executive vice president for academic affairs.
 He then returned to teaching until his death in 2006. Ringel and his wife, Estelle, left $100,000 in their estate to help fund the gallery, saying, "We truly believe that the arts, in all their magnificent forms of beauty, must have a prominent place wherever and whenever people gather to ask the profound questions of the ages.
 The gallery is the learning environment, the archive and the studio of the lively and liberating mind." A native of Brooklyn, N.Y.
, Ringel received his bachelor's degree in 1959 from Brooklyn College and his master's and doctoral degrees from Purdue.

 Purdue to offer energy efficiency workshop, home tours
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University's College of Technology will offer a free workshop Aug. 11 on making homes more energy efficient, and two energy-efficient homes will be open for tours.
 Workshop participants will learn about simple improvements they can make to their homes to save energy, said Eric Holt, a graduate teaching assistant in the building construction management program.
 The workshop will be from 9 a.m. to noon at the Chatham Square community center in Lafayette. Chatham Square is at Greenbush Street and Shenandoah Drive.
 The home at 2150 Ulen Lane is a deep energy retrofit project. The city of Lafayette purchased the foreclosed house in 2010. Purdue students helped guide the process of gutting the structure and rebuilding it as a prime example of an energy-efficient home.
 The second home is the INhome solar house designed and built by Purdue students for the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon 2011 in Washington, D.C.
 It is located in the Chatham Square development. INhome took second place among 20 homes in that international competition and also won a Green Building Award from the National Association of Home Builders this year.
 More than 200 students from technology, engineering, liberal arts, agriculture, Krannert, and health and human sciences were involved in designing, building and operating INhome.
 After the Washington competition, the two-bedroom house was dismantled and brought back to Lafayette, where it was rebuilt in Chatham Square and put up for sale.
 It is under contract with a buyer. Closing is expected in September.

 Purdue to test emergency all-hazards outdoor sirens during Boiler Gold Rush
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University will test its all-hazards outdoor emergency warning sirens Monday (Aug. 13) during an orientation program for new students, said Ron Wright, director of campus emergency preparedness and planning.
 The university's seven sirens, placed strategically around campus, are scheduled to be sounded at approximately 3:25 p.m., Wright said.
 The test coincides with Boiler Gold Rush, Purdue's weeklong orientation program for new students. The exercise, Wright said, will determine if all the sirens work and let the new students know what they sound like and what to do when the sirens are activated.
 Gold Rush's student leaders are being trained so that they can instruct the new students immediately following the test on how they should react in a real emergency.
 In an actual emergency, the sirens indicate a disaster or imminent threat involving the entire campus and/or surrounding community.
 The sirens signal individuals to shelter in place, meaning to go to lowest level of a building or to get to the nearest room and secure the doors, depending upon the situation.
 When possible, people on campus also should check the Purdue home page email and local media for more information on the emergency and the appropriate action to take, Wright said.
 The sirens are part of Purdue Alert, a multilayered system to notify people on campus of an emergency. Other notifications include the use of mass email, mass text-messaging and Boiler TV.
 To register to receive emergency text message notifications, go to http://www.purdue.edu/securepurdue, click on "Change My Emergency Contact Number," enter your Purdue account name and password, and enter your cell phone number.

 Córdova: trimester plan will accelerate time-to-degree, enhance educational opportunities
 Purdue President France A. Córdova speaks Wednesday (Jan. 11) during an Indianapolis news conference at the Lumina Foundation to announce the university will proceed with the first steps toward a balanced trimester.
 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons)Download Photo INDIANAPOLIS - Purdue University is rolling out the first initiative of its decadal funding plan with the announcement on Wednesday (Jan.
 11) that it will proceed with the first steps toward a balanced trimester. The trimester is an effort designed to enhance students' academic opportunities as well as help them move more quickly toward graduation.
 President France A. Córdova, during the announcement at the Lumina Foundation headquarters, said that the balanced trimester initiative is one of several to be unveiled over the next few months in the decadal planning process.
 Purdue's decadal funding plan is a long-term commitment to help offset declining state appropriations and reduce tuition increases.
 "We have spent a lot of time thinking through the various elements of the 10-year funding plan," she said. "Now that we better understand the costs and returns involved, it's time to put these initiatives in motion.
" Beginning this summer, the university will expand its summer program offerings as a first step toward implementing a full-summer trimester.
 "Purdue has moved boldly to become more productive, affordable and supportive of students more quickly completing their degrees," said Indiana Gov.
 Mitch Daniels. "This is how leaders act." Offering a third semester each year will help some students complete a nominal four-year degree in as little as three years, saving them time and money, and it will give others the chance to take advantage of study-abroad and internship opportunities.
 When fully implemented, the trimester initiative could mean $40 million in additional revenue for the university and would make better use of classrooms, residence halls and other campus facilities during the summer months.
 "This initiative will make a Purdue education more affordable because a greater array of summer course and program offerings, combined with discounted summer tuition, will result in a faster time to completion for some students," said Tim Sands, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs.
 Purdue's fall and spring tuition schedule for the main campus in West Lafayette is already designed to encourage full course loads by offering credits above eight for no additional charge.
 In addition, students taking from eight to 16 credits in the summer receive a discount relative to fall and spring rates; that discount is as high as 50 percent for students who take eight or nine credits in the summer.
 In embarking on this more aggressive efficiency and opportunity initiative, Purdue is exploring ideas for further incentives, course packages and scholarships, along with financial models that encourage departments to implement summer academic programs to jump-start the trimester initiative.

 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons)Download Photo "Purdue's decision to move toward a full-summer trimester offers students expanded opportunities to accelerate graduation and save money and is aligned with the commission's goals of increasing completion and ensuring affordability," said Teresa Lubbers, Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education.
 Jamie Merisotis, Lumina Foundation president and CEO, said, "Lumina Foundation is honored to host the announcement of Purdue's new trimester effort.
 We applaud Purdue University and President Córdova's plan to accelerate the time-to-degree. This is an innovative approach and reflects a strong commitment to serving students and the state of Indiana.
" The project is a key part of the decadal funding plan to increase sources of revenue beyond tuition and state appropriations - the traditional sources for public university funding - by doubling revenue capacity through continued cost-cutting, expanding online degree and professional education offerings, encouraging more robust use of campus facilities through summer teaching and learning, and ramping up research commercialization.
 Purdue trustee JoAnn Brouillette said the trimester effort was attractive to trustees because it would benefit students and the university's bottom line.
 "The advantages for students are several, and it helps the university financially while making better use of buildings and equipment," she said.
 "The additional revenue will help cut our cost per credit hour." Córdova said, "We've made a commitment to students and the state Legislature that Purdue will do everything possible to keep tuition affordable and still deliver an exceptional education and a valuable degree.
" Currently, 6,000 students take summer classes at Purdue's main campus for an average of four to five credit hours each. The goal is to grow the summer trimester to more than 20,000 students by 2022.
 Although savings for students and the institution would accrue from year-round utilization of facilities, expenses also would grow, with additional pay needed for professors and support staff.
 Financial aid also would need attention since most programs typically cover only two semesters in an academic year. One option for additional Indiana student support will be Purdue's Indiana Challenge scholarship program.
 Córdova announced this summer that $7 million earned through university investments would be used to boost private donations for student support, with $300,000 dedicated to support veterans and their dependents and $6.7 million for the scholarship-matching program.
 The Purdue Indiana Challenge Match will contribute to the Access and Success student scholarship and programming campaign. The campaign brought in $42.6 million in 2010-2011, for a four-year campaign total of $170.6 million towards the $304 million goal by 2014.
 The campaign supports the Presidential and Trustees Scholarships, Marquis Scholarships for middle-income students, and the Emerging Urban Leaders Scholarships for students from targeted urban areas.

 Purdue workshop prepares high school teachers, students for global synthetic biology competition
 Purdue workshop prepares high school teachers, students for global synthetic biology competition High school students and teachers from Indiana and Kansas participated in Purdue's BioBuilding 2012 workshop to prepare for this month's International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition at Greenfield (Ind.
) Central High School. Conducting research in a Bindley Bioscience Center laboratory in Discovery Park, from left, are Blue Valley High School Corrine Andresen, Davina Shogbamimu, bioscience teacher Eric Kessler and Hannah McCready, all of Blue Valley High School in Overland Park, Kan.
 (Purdue University photo/Vince Walter)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Thanks to biotechnology and biological engineering professors at Purdue University, several high school students and their teachers are better prepared for this week's International Genetically Engineered Machines competition on synthetic biology research.
 More than 40 teams from across the globe will compete in the event, known as iGEM High School, including 30 U.S. teams, seven from Asia and four from Europe.
 Greenfield (Ind.) Central High School is serving as host for the international event, which begins Saturday (June 30). "Why teach synthetic biology?
 Synthetic biology provides high school teachers and students an engineering context to learn molecular biology, genetic engineering and microbiology methods," said Kari Clase, a biotechnology professor in the College of Technology.
 "This approach asks students to learn while designing, or testing designs of, engineered biological systems. It also provides science teachers with a means of exploring numerous state and national technology standards that are hard to address in most science classes.
" Clase and fellow biological engineering professor Jenna Rickus of the College of Agriculture led the BioBuilding 2012 workshop at Purdue in early June, exposing high school teachers and students from Indiana and Kansas to innovative teaching and research techniques in synthetic biology, biotechnology and other areas.
 Assisted by several Purdue undergraduate and graduate students, the high school students and teachers also worked in research labs and classroom activities in Discovery Park's 
Bindley Bioscience Center and elsewhere on campus, gaining insight into what it takes to start, nurture and successfully compete as an iGEM team at the high school level.
 Greenfield chemistry and physics teacher Rebecca Schini participated in the Purdue BioBuilding 2012 workshop and is lead organizer for this week's iGEM competition.
 "This experience has been very exciting, because it has exposed me to terrific professors here at Purdue and other bright high school teachers and students," said Hannah McCready, who will be a senior this fall at Blue Valley High School in Overland Park, Kan.
 "It's also really impressive to see how Purdue is investing in resources and labs in Discovery Park and elsewhere on campus. This has helped me make a list of the things I need to look for when I'm looking at colleges for a degree in biomedical engineering and possibly medical school.
" An emerging field, synthetic biology applies engineering and mathematical principles to the development of novel biological systems.
 These principles and technologies extend the teaching of molecular genetic techniques into real world, authentic applications, such as bacteria that smell like bananas, and light-sensitive bacteria that can serve as pixels in a photograph.
 "It's been great being immersed with all the knowledge, technology and diversity at Purdue," said Kevin O'Brien, who will be a junior this fall at North Montgomery High School in Crawfordsville.
 "All the new buildings and research facilities in Discovery Park have fired me up about possibly attending Purdue. It's blown away my expectations about Purdue.
" Several high school teachers also gained materials and ideas for developing compelling curricula and cutting-edge content for college-bound students interested in subjects ranging from math and engineering to biology and electronics.
 BioBuilding workshop equipped teachers in the STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - with a more rigorous curriculum for motivating high-achieving students.
 Schini said this year's workshop was a terrific tune-up for the iGEM students and teachers, exposing them to cutting-edge research in high-tech labs.
 Schini started the iGEM High School competition in 2010. Since 2004, iGEM has been a competition in synthetic biology research for college students and teams.
 "These kids are amazing," said Schini, who spent eight years as an industry microbiologist before becoming a high school teacher.
 "Many STEM competitions are national. Now, iGEM High School is an international competition that helps these students reach a global community.
 As teachers, we should harness this ability of the teenage brain to help solve global challenges." Fellow Greenfield biology teacher John Rihm participated in the Purdue BioBuilding workshop and is coaching this year's Greenfield iGEM team.
 Rickus said the BioBuilding activities are ideal for helping the high school teachers and students understand how simple biological systems can be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operate in living cells.
 "The cross-discipline nature of the activities and the iGEM competition teaches students how to collaborate and critically think to find solutions to major scientific problems," she said.
 BioBuilder was started by Massachusetts Institute of Technology biological engineering professor Natalie Kuldell in 2007 in response to requests for synthetic biology learning materials from policymakers, environmental groups and others needing to know more about the basic biology involved, as well as scientists wanting to know more about engineering aspects of the field.

 Purdue workshop to focus on role of simulation in addressing challenges of photovoltaic science, technology and manufacturing
 Purdue workshop to focus on role of simulation in addressing challenges of photovoltaic science, technology and manufacturing This graphic shows color-coded simulation results from advanced computational models used to characterize the properties of materials used in organic photovoltaic solar cells in efforts to better understand the physics involved and to improve the technology.
 The Network for Photovoltaic Technology, led by Purdue and funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation, aims to develop such computational capabilities for broad range of PV technologies for higher efficiency and reduced manufacture cost.
 (B. Ray, P. Nair, E. García, and M. Alam, Purdue University) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Leading researchers from industry, national laboratories and academia will join federal agency officials for a Purdue University symposium next week, focusing on the use of photovoltaic cells for converting sunlight into electricity as an affordable alternative energy source.
 "Challenges in Photovoltaic Science, Technology and Manufacturing: A Focus on the Role of Theory, Modeling and Simulation" is scheduled for Aug.
 2-3 at the Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering, Room 1010. The event also will celebrate the launch of the Purdue Network for Photovoltaic Technology
, which was established in 2011 as part of a $5 million energy research initiative funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation
 (SRC) to team companies with university research centers to work on alternative energy technologies. "What are the challenges in moving photovoltaic forward?
 Where have theory, modeling and simulation been most effective? Can modeling and simulation play the same enabling role in the PV industry as it did for the electronics industry?
" said event co-organizer Mark Lundstrom, the Don and Carol Scifres Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and co-director of the Purdue Network for Photovoltaic Technology.
 "Looking to the future, how important will theory, modeling and simulation be? What are the specific opportunities and how should the photovoltaic community address them?
 This workshop will provide different perspectives on the questions to be addressed and set the stage for lively discussion." The invitation-only event is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the 
Purdue Energy Center and is being organized by the Purdue Network for Photovoltaic Technology, the SRC and the Bay Area Photovoltaic Consortium, which is funded by the U.S.
 Department of Energy. Photovoltaics is a clean energy source for converting sunlight into electricity, and few other power-generating technologies have as little environmental impact.
 The technology, however, faces several hurdles - primarily costs, efficiency and reliability relating to power generation and transmission.
 During the two-day workshop, Purdue will highlight the interactive website, nanoHUB.org, and its success in disseminating and sharing research simulations globally.
 The work is associated with nanoHUB.org, which makes available scientific simulations, seminars, interactive courses and other specialized nanotech-related materials.
 The Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN), a six-university network funded by the NSF and based at Purdue, operates nanoHUB.
 The SRC's 30 years of success in fostering research between industry and universities also will be showcased. The Durham, N.C.-based organization has been instrumental in expanding the industry knowledge base and attracting premier students to help innovate and transfer semiconductor technology to the industry.
 Recently, the SRC launched the Energy Research Initiative, which is working to bring its experience in managing industry and academic partnerships for addressing the fundamental problems of energy generation, transmission and storage.
 Event co-organizer Pankaj Sharma, managing director of the Energy Center in Discovery Park, said the workshop also will highlight Purdue's partnership role in a newly funded DOE program, Solar Energy Research Institute for India and the United States (
SERIIUS). This $50 million consortium on the U.S.-India Joint Clean Energy R&D Center on Solar Energy is led by Larry Kazmerski, who is executive director for Science and Technology Partnerships at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
 "The institute's goal is to accelerate development, at a lower cost per watt, of photovoltaics and concentrated solar power," Sharma said.
 "This bi-national consortium is focused on readying emerging disruptive and revolutionary solar technologies that span the gap between fundamental science and applied R&D, leading to sustainable industries.
" With funding from the SRC, Purdue launched the Network for Photovoltaic Technology in July 2011 to build on previous research by Lundstrom and Ashraf Alam, a Purdue professor of electrical and computer engineering.
 They are applying to photovoltaics the same developed advanced models for predicting the performance and reliability of new designs for silicon transistors.
 Alam, who co-directs the Purdue Network for Photovoltaic Technology, said computational models and simulations are helping researchers test concepts and reliability in an effort to accelerate the aging of solar cells to see how long they will last.
 "Estimates for the cost of photovoltaics assume the cells will only last for 20 to 30 years, but what if they're more likely to last 60 years?
" Alam said. "The cost landscape among competing clean technologies would be altered dramatically as a result." The Purdue-led network, based at Discovery Park's Birck Nanotechnology Center, also aims to train and educate students, providing them with the expertise and skills needed to transition these new methods into the marketplace.
 The initiative also includes a smart grid research center at Carnegie Mellon University to support the incorporation of renewable energy resources and provide modeling, simulation and control tools needed to manage, optimize and secure the power grid.

 Purdue's Science on Tap talk to focus on efforts to breed hardier honeybees
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Purdue University entomologist will speak Thursday (Sept. 20) about research efforts to breed hardier, parasite-resistant honeybees in North America and Europe at the next 
Science on Tap. Honeybee specialist Greg Hunt, a professor of behavioral genetics and author, will speak at 6 p.m. in the upstairs of the Lafayette Brewing Company, 622 Main St.
, Lafayette. His talk is titled "What's Bugging our Bees? Bee Health, Parasitic Mites and Breeding for Hardy, Resistant Bees." The event is free and open to those 21 and older.
 Sponsors for the talk are the Purdue Department of Entomology, the College of Agriculture and Discovery Park. "There has been a lot of talk in recent years about 'colony collapse disorder' killing beehives.
 Researchers and beekeepers are still unsure what caused this and how big a problem it may be," Hunt said. "Recent surveys indicate that parasitic Varroa mites are the biggest single factor associated with the death of bee colonies in both North America and Europe.
" Hunt and his fellow Purdue researchers are investigating how to breed bees that are more mite-resistant. The research team is collaborating with Indiana beekeepers in a breeding program to select for "mite-biting" bees and the team has been investigating the genetics behind this trait.
 "We identified one chromosomal region influencing this grooming behavior," he said. "One gene that might be involved has been linked to specific neurological diseases in humans.
" According to Hunt, the United States is losing about one-third of its honeybee hives each year. No one factor is to blame, but Hunt said scientists think others such as mites and insecticides are working against the bees, which are important for pollinating food crops and wild plants.
 The official bee population in Indiana is well over 10,000 hives and each hive holds anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 bees, he said.
 Hunt, who has been on the Purdue faculty since 2002, received his bachelor's degree in biology from John Carroll University in 1979, a master's degree in plant pathology from Pennsylvania State University and a doctorate degree in entomology from the University of California, Davis, in 1994.
 The Science on Tap lecture series, led by Purdue graduate students Patrick Dolan, Shaili Sharma and Becca Scott, provides Purdue faculty and collaborating researchers the opportunity to share research activities in an informal setting, with presentations that are designed to appeal to a more general audience.

 Rain brings relief to Indiana, but drought continues
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - While a major weather pattern change that brought much-needed rain and cooler temperatures to the parched eastern Corn Belt is welcome relief, Purdue University climatologists warn against thinking the drought is almost over.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Drought Monitor (http://www.droughtmonitor.unl.edu) update on Thursday (Aug. 16) shows a shrinking area of exceptional drought - the worst drought rating available - that has gripped southwest and west-central Indiana.
 The southern half of the state is still largely encompassed by extreme to exceptional drought, but the northern half of the state mostly ranges from the lesser categories of moderate to severe.
 The hot dome of high pressure that had been parked over Indiana and the Midwest much of the summer has shifted to the southwestern states, taking the excessive heat west with it, said Ken Scheeringa, associate state climatologist for the 
Indiana State Climate Office at Purdue. "This shift has allowed the jet stream, which was stuck far north of Indiana earlier this summer, to sink farther south, putting much of the state right into the storm track," Scheeringa said.
 "This change has given us better opportunities for more frequent and heavier rainfall with greater area coverage." A few weeks ago, climatologists were expecting more of the same - a warmer-than-normal August with little rain.
 But recent shifts in the storm track driven by the jet stream and large-scale movement of the high-pressure system have changed that thinking.
 "We will continue to evaluate our outlook for August," Scheeringa said. "In particular, if this pattern continues, it would be possible for August to end up with normal to cooler temperatures and about normal rainfall.
 As of today, August is near normal in temperature and above normal in rainfall. We will see what happens in the next two weeks."
 While all of this certainly helps reduce drought conditions, Indiana State Climatologist Dev Niyogi cautions against thinking that Indiana's drought is over.
 "When folks see that the grass has greened up, the tendency is to think the drought is nearly over," he said. "But drought is more than lack of rainfall.
 It is a delicate balance between supply and demand. We need to consider the water status of deep wells, reservoirs and streams, many of which are depleted and will take a while to recover.
 "The fact is there is still a large unmet demand and many regions with rainfall deficit. The Drought Monitor likely will continue to show drought for a while, but should continue to show slow improvement.

 Rap music powers rhythmic action of medical sensor
 This graphic illustrates the principles behind the operation of a new type of miniature medical sensor powered by acoustic waves, including those found in music such as rap, blues, jazz and rock.
 The device, a pressure sensor, might ultimately help to treat people stricken with aneurisms or incontinence due to paralysis. (Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University)
Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The driving bass rhythm of rap music can be harnessed to power a new type of miniature medical sensor designed to be implanted in the body.
Acoustic waves from music, particularly rap, were found to effectively recharge the pressure sensor. Such a device might ultimately help to treat people stricken with aneurisms or incontinence due to paralysis.
The heart of the sensor is a vibrating cantilever, a thin beam attached at one end like a miniature diving board. Music within a certain range of frequencies, from 200-500 hertz, causes the cantilever to vibrate, generating electricity and storing a charge in a capacitor, said Babak Ziaie, a Purdue University professor of electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering.
"The music reaches the correct frequency only at certain times, for example, when there is a strong bass component," he said. "The acoustic energy from the music can pass through body tissue, causing the cantilever to vibrate.
"When the frequency falls outside of the proper range, the cantilever stops vibrating, automatically sending the electrical charge to the sensor, which takes a pressure reading and transmits data as radio signals.
 Because the frequency is continually changing according to the rhythm of a musical composition, the sensor can be induced to repeatedly alternate intervals of storing charge and transmitting data.
"You would only need to do this for a couple of minutes every hour or so to monitor either blood pressure or pressure of urine in the bladder," Ziaie said.
 "It doesn't take long to do the measurement."Findings are detailed in a paper to be presented during the IEEE MEMS conference, which will be Jan.
 29 to Feb. 2 in Paris. The paper was written by doctoral student Albert Kim, research scientist Teimour Maleki and Ziaie. Researchers have created a new type of miniature pressure sensor, shown here, designed to be implanted in the body.
 Acoustic waves from music or plain tones drive a vibrating device called a cantilever, generating a charge to power the sensor. (Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University)
Download Photo "This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the concept," he said.The device is an example of a microelectromechanical system, or MEMS, and was created in the Birck Nanotechnology Center at the university's Discovery Park.
 The cantilever beam is made from a ceramic material called lead zirconate titanate, or PZT, which is piezoelectric, meaning it generates electricity when compressed.
 The sensor is about 2 centimeters long. Researchers tested the device in a water-filled balloon.A receiver that picks up the data from the sensor could be placed several inches from the patient.
 Playing tones within a certain frequency range also can be used instead of music."But a plain tone is a very annoying sound," Ziaie said.
 "We thought it would be novel and also more aesthetically pleasing to use music."Researchers experimented with four types of music: rap, blues, jazz and rock.
"Rap is the best because it contains a lot of low frequency sound, notably the bass," Ziaie said.The sensor is capable of monitoring pressure in the urinary bladder and in the sack of a blood vessel damaged by an aneurism.
 Such a technology could be used in a system for treating incontinence in people with paralysis by checking bladder pressure and stimulating the spinal cord to close the sphincter that controls urine flow from the bladder.
 More immediately, it could be used to diagnose incontinence. The conventional diagnostic method now is to insert a probe with a catheter, which must be in place for several hours while the patient remains at the hospital.
"A wireless implantable device could be inserted and left in place, allowing the patient to go home while the pressure is monitored," Ziaie said.
The new technology offers potential benefits over conventional implantable devices, which either use batteries or receive power through a property called inductance, which uses coils on the device and an external transmitter.
 Both approaches have downsides. Batteries have to be replaced periodically, and data are difficult to retrieve from devices that use inductance; coils on the implanted device and an external receiver must be lined up precisely, and they can only be about a centimeter apart.
A patent application has been filed for the design. Writer: Emil Venere, 765-494-4709, venere@purdue.eduSource: Babak Ziaie, 765-494-0725, bziaie@purdue.edu

 ABSTRACTA Novel Electromechanical Interrogation Scheme for Implantable Passive TranspondersA. Kim, T. Maleki, and B. Ziaie This paper presents design, fabrication and implementation of a novel electromechanical energy scavenging and wireless interrogation scheme using low-frequency components of musical vibrations to overcome challenges associated with previously reported passive transponders such as: short transmission range, misalignment sensitivity and complicated receiver circuitry.
 The transponder has two phases of operation: 1) mechanical vibration phase, in which an acoustic receiver (a piezoelectric cantilever) converts the sound vibration into electrical power and charges a capacitor; and 2) electrical radiation phase, in which the stored charge is dumped into an LC tank, forcing it to oscillate at its natural resonance frequency and emitting the energy to an outside receiver.
 In a pressure-sensing configuration, the distance between a planar coil and a ferrite core is modulated by the pressure, thus changing the inductance and, in turn, inducing a change in the frequency of the emitted signal.
 A prototype transponder was built and tested using a PZT cantilever with a mechanical resonant frequency of 435 Hz encapsulated in a glass capsule (length=40 mm, diameter=8 mm) along with a rectifier circuitry and a storage capacitor.
 The inductive pressure sensor located outside the capsule had a sensitivity of 2.5k Hz/kPa. We were able to easily pick up the transmitted RF pulses at distances of up to 7 cm without the tight requirement on alignment between the receiver and the transponder coils.

 Rapidly cooling eggs can double shelf life, decrease risk of illness
 Kevin Keener developed a rapid egg cooling system that uses circulated carbon dioxide to create a thin layer of ice inside an egg's shell that cools the inside of an egg within minutes, strengthening proteins and increasing shelf life.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication file photo/Keith Robinson) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Taking just a few seconds to cool freshly laid eggs would add weeks to their shelf life, according to a Purdue University study.
 The rapid-cooling process, developed by Kevin Keener, a professor of food science, uses liquid carbon dioxide to stabilize the proteins in egg whites so much that they could be rated AA – the highest grade for eggs – for 12 weeks.
 Earlier research showed that the same cooling technology could significantly reduce occurrences of salmonella illnesses. "There is no statistical difference in quality between eggs as measured by Haugh units just after laying and rapidly cooled eggs at 12 weeks," he said.
 "This rapid-cooling process can provide a significant extension in the shelf life of eggs compared to traditional processing." Keener's results, published in the journal 
Poultry Science, also show that membranes surrounding the eggs' yolks were maintained for 12 weeks when eggs were rapidly cooled.
 That membrane is a barrier that keeps harmful bacteria from reaching the yolk, a nutrient-rich reservoir that bacteria could use as a food source.
 "The structural integrity of the yolk membrane stays strong longer, which may provide a food safety benefit," he said. "The membrane being stronger would be another defense against bacterial invasion, such as salmonella.
" The rapid-cooling technology takes liquid carbon dioxide and turns it into a "snow" to rapidly lower the eggs' temperature. Eggs are placed in a cooling chamber and carbon dioxide gas at about minus 110 degrees Fahrenheit is generated.
 The cold gas is circulated around the eggs and forms a thin layer of ice inside the eggshell. After treatment, the ice layer melts and quickly lowers an egg's internal temperature to below 45 degrees, the temperature at which salmonella can no longer grow.
 Keener's previous research showed that the carbon dioxide in bicarbonate form significantly increases the activity of lysozyme, an enzyme in the egg white that has bactericidal properties.
 Traditionally, eggs are at more than 100 degrees when placed into a carton. Thirty dozen eggs are then packed in a case, and 30 cases are stacked onto pallets and placed in refrigerated coolers.
 The eggs in the middle of the pallet can take up to 142 hours - nearly six days - to cool to 45 degrees, Keener said. Keener said a 2005 U.S.
 government report showed that if eggs were cooled and stored at 45 degrees within 12 hours of laying, there would be about 100,000 fewer salmonella illnesses from eggs in the nation each year.
 Rapid cooling could also increase the ability to export eggs to places where this isn't possible today. "You could send eggs anywhere in the world if you could get even eight weeks of shelf life at AA quality.
 We're seeing 12 weeks," Keener said. "Right now, you can't ship eggs anywhere in the world and expect to retain that quality." Keener said with additional funding he would continue to study the benefits of rapid cooling, including inoculating the inside of shell eggs with Salmonella and examining how other proteins in the whites and yolks of eggs are affected.
 Keener is a technical consultant to the American Egg Board and a member of the United Egg Producers Scientific Advisory Panel. His work was funded by Purdue and gift funds.
 Maximizing Carbon Dioxide Content of Shell Eggs by Rapid Cooling Treatment and Its Effect on Shell Egg Quality Rapid cooling of shell eggs using liquid CO
2 has been shown to cool eggs to 7°C within minutes, as opposed to days required by traditional cooling treatments. This quick-cooling technique is component in the maintenance of egg quality and extended shelf life beyond the current 30-45-d period.
 The hypothesis for the current study was that maximizing CO2 content of the eggs during cooling may increase Haugh units and thus extend shelf life (physical quality factors).
 The objective of this study was to maximize CO2 content of shell eggs during rapid cooling with liquid CO2 and determine its effect on egg quality during 12 wk of refrigerated storage.
 Three cooling conditions selected for the study were −45°C for 18 min (treatment A), −60°C for 15 min (treatment B), and −75°C for 12 min (treatment C).
 After rapid-cooling treatment, it took approximately 25 min for the internal temperature of eggs to equilibrate to 7°C. The Haugh units of the rapidly cooled eggs were significantly higher than the traditionally cooled (control) eggs.
 After 12 wk of refrigerated (5–7°C) storage, control eggs were only 37% AA-grade, 57% A-grade, and 6% B-grade. In comparison, all the rapidly cooled eggs averaged to 80% AA-grade and 20% A-grade.
 After 6 wk, the average quality of control eggs reduced to grade A, whereas rapid cooling treatment was able to maintain AA quality up to 12 wk.
 The CO2 content of the rapidly cooled eggs (1.8 mg of CO2/g of albumen) showed no difference between treatments A, B, and C, but it was significantly higher than the control (1.3 mg of CO
2/g of albumen). In addition, the vitelline membrane strength of the control decreased 65% during storage and was between 30 and 50% of the vitelline membrane strength of CO
2-cooled eggs at 12 wk. Rapid cooling with liquid CO2 extends shelf life of shell eggs.

 Raymond selected as new director of Discovery Park's Center for Environment
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue political science professor Leigh Raymond has been selected as the new director of Discovery Park's 
Center for the Environment, a research center dedicated to meeting the world's emerging environmental challenges. Raymond, co-author of the original proposal creating the Center for the Environment in 2006 and an expert on environmental and alternative energy policy issues, will replace interim director Jon Harbor, professor and head of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.
 "Leigh Raymond has a distinguished record of scholarship, teaching and engagement in environmental and policy issues," said Alan H.
 Rebar, executive director of Discovery Park and senior associate vice president for research at Purdue. "He has been deeply involved with interdisciplinary environmental efforts since coming to Purdue in 2002 and had a major role in helping launch the Center for the Environment.
 We're excited about the spirit of collaboration he will bring to his role as director of the Center for the Environment." Raymond said his primary role as the center's director will be to foster a culture of inclusiveness among the wide range of research and interests in environmental issues and themes already under way at Purdue.
 "Having been involved with the Center for the Environment from its beginning, I'm very excited to work with our faculty, students and staff to continue to develop Purdue's efforts to help solve important environmental challenges as director," Raymond said.
 Raymond, who also helped Purdue launch the Global Sustainability Institute in 2009, has been a key leader for several recent campus events, including a 2012 international workshop on new perspectives on intractable global problems, the 2011 "Beyond Climategate" panel discussion, and the 2010 workshop on emissions trading policy.
 He has an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Yale University and master’s and doctorate degrees in environmental science, policy and management from the University of California, Berkeley.
 He research and teaching interests span a wide range of environmental issues, including climate change, endangered species protection, regulation of environmental risks from synthetic chemicals, renewables fuels policy and market-based environmental policies.
 Raymond also serves as board president of the NICHES Land Trust, a local nonprofit organization protecting more than 2,500 acres of conservation land.
 Researchers at Purdue's Center for the Environment are studying ways to help society meet important environmental challenges by modeling and predicting the impact of human activity on ecosystems, monitoring environmental quality, conserving natural resources and developing new technologies.
 Making new connections between faculty studying the physical and natural sciences and social scientists studying the “human dimensions” of environmental challenges is another center priority.
 The center also offers many opportunities for students to participate in its research programs. The Global Sustainability Institute (GSI), also led by Harbor, was launched in Discovery Park to coordinate Purdue's research efforts in sustainability challenges such as climate change, energy, food security, the environment and water.
 In addition to the Center for the Environment, GSI also includes the Energy Center, Purdue Water Community, Purdue Climate Change Research Center
 and the Purdue Center for Global Food Security.

 Rebuilding from Western wildfires begins now with friendships, social networks
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - How well residents evicted by Western wildfires know their neighbors will likely play a major role in how they cope and rebuild, says a Purdue University expert.
 "The relationships people have with their neighbors are invaluable in the recovery from natural disasters from the moment an evacuation issue notice is granted to living in shelters and to how a community rebuilds after a wildfire, flooding or hurricane," says 
Daniel Aldrich, an associate professor of political science who studies how people recover from natural disasters. "Supporting these social networks is just as important as the logistical planning of surviving and taking shelter from a natural disaster.
 My research shows that people who know their neighbors are more likely to survive and return to their communities to rebuild." In some cases, survival begins when neighbors know each other well enough to be aware that someone has a medical condition or is not mobile.
 This information can be essential during an evacuation period or for the long-term care of residents. "Real social networks can save your life.
 Knowing your neighbor is especially critical in remote wilderness areas where people are more scattered," says Aldrich, who has studied disaster recovery from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami.
 Wildfires currently rage in Colorado and New Mexico where thousands of people have evacuated and hundreds of structures have been destroyed.
 "Many of the people affected during Hurricane Katrina lived in city neighborhoods and it might have been easier to know neighbors and communicate with them during the evacuation," says Aldrich, who is author of the upcoming book, "Building Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery.
" "Most people know to have a disaster kit prepared with essentials such as flashlights and water, but I encourage people to extend that to getting to know your neighbors and even being sure you have their phone numbers and other pertinent information.
 The reality often is that when disaster strikes, it may take the professionals a while to arrive, and residents need to rely on each other for help.
" Source: Daniel Aldrich, daniel.aldrich@gmail.com. Aldrich is in Washington, D.C., and can be contacted by email to schedule phone or Skype interviews.

 Recreational center to begin phased opening of completed areas
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The student recreation facility, soon to be named the France A. Córdova Recreational Sports Center (CREC), will have phased openings this fall with various portions being made available prior to the facility's Homecoming weekend grand opening.
 On Aug. 19, in addition to the fitness equipment and activity currently available in the Turf Recreation Exercise Center and Tarkington and Wiley halls, students will have access to the newly air-conditioned and renovated Black Gym (formerly the East Gym) for basketball and the Boilermaker Aquatic Center.
 Group exercise classes will continue to be available in Harrison Hall. On Sept. 28, approximately 75 percent of CREC will be made available, including the majority of the fitness spaces, six more courts, the bouldering wall and many of the multipurpose spaces.
 "With this size remodeling project, a phased opening works better for the coordination of the completion of the work," said Robert McMains, vice president for physical facilities.
 The grand opening is scheduled for Oct. 12, when the dedication and naming ceremony will also occur. By that time the remainder of the fitness and multipurpose spaces, the multi-activity court, the atrium track, and the climbing wall will be complete.
 During the remainder of fall semester, work will be completed on the recreation pool and the feature gym. Additionally, TREC will be converted to an indoor turf center and final work will be completed on the Black Gym.
 "With this soft opening, our students will get the Black Gym at the start of fall semester, and we'll have most of the facility open in September, which is what we wanted for the students," said Howard Taylor, director of recreational sports.
 "We are really looking forward to this year as the facility becomes a reality."

 'Red Tail' squadron flying to Purdue to honor Tuskegee Airmen
 The Commemorative Air Force Red Tail Squadron is bringing it's RISE ABOVE Traveling Exhibition that honors the Tuskegee Airmen to Purdue during Homecoming Week.
 Brad Lang, a 1985 Purdue aviation technology graduate (pictured) and son of a Tuskegee airman, will fly in a restored Red Tail version of the P-51C Mustang flown during WW II by America's first black airmen.
 (Photo provided CAF Red Tail Squadron)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — The Commemorative Air Force Red Tail Squadron will visit Purdue Airport on Oct.
 10-13 to honor the Tuskegee Airmen and teach about their color boundary-breaking accomplishments during World War II. The squadron will bring a restored, red-tailed P-51C Mustang flown by the airmen during the war and the interactive RISE ABOVE Traveling Exhibit that uses the example of America's first black military pilots and their crew members to teach schoolchildren how to rise above adversity to achieve their dreams.
 Many expected the Tuskegee training program that President Franklin Roosevelt established, under political pressure, would fail.
 But the bomber crews flying dangerous missions over Germany learned to rely on and request escort from the skilled "red tail angels" because of their fierce combat style.
 In the last two years of the war, Tuskegee Airmen flew more than 1,500 missions. Their excellence helped prompt the Pentagon to desegregate all of its armed forces in 1948.
 That paved the way for leaders like Gen. Colin Powell, who rose to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the U.S.
 The squadron will host visiting students in grades 3-12, who will see a short movie profiling the airmen, visit the fighter plane, talk with the pilot, fly in a simulator and engage in activities run by Purdue colleges of Science, Technology, Engineering and Liberal Arts.
 Older students will have the opportunity to eat in a Purdue dining court, and, if they choose, tour campus. Red Tail pilot Brad Lang, a Purdue Avition Technology graduate and son of a Tuskegee Airman, said all students will learn the six Rise Above guiding principles: aim high, believe in yourself, use your brain, never quit, be ready to go and expect to win.
 "Most of the Tuskegee trainees had already attended college, but less than half of the first class made it through the rigorous flight training program," Purdue Aviation Technology lecturer Robert Moser said.
 "Only those who studied hard became pilots." The exhibit will be open to the general public at no charge from 3-5 p.m. on Oct 10-12 and 9 a.m.
 to noon on Homecoming Saturday (Oct. 13) at the Purdue Airport. For more information on field trips and public viewing opportunities, contact Vanessa Buntin at 
vpuckett@purdue.edu. The travelling exhibit can accommodate a maximum of 35 students per group. Slots are available on a first-come basis.
 The reservation deadline is Oct. 8. Christine Taylor, Purdue's vice provost for diversty, will host an invitation-only scholarship banquet Oct.

 Reduced cattle herd could mean bigger profits starting late 2013
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The U.S. beef herd has been shrinking, and the worst drought in decades has only encouraged that trend to continue.
 But for beef producers who can withstand the financial hardship over the next several months, reduced beef supplies could mean bigger profits starting as early as late 2013.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture's midyear cattle inventory report showed beef cow numbers dropped by 3 percent in the last year.
 It projects the 2012 calf crop to be down 2 percent from last year, and down 8 percent since 2006. Part of what has been driving the decline is skyrocketing feed costs and prolonged drought in the Southern Plains, said Chris Hurt, Purdue Extension agricultural economist.
 "This year's drought likely means further decreases in cow numbers over the next 12-14 months," he said. "The impacts of the drought are just beginning to show up in some of the national data.
 We do know the direction, but not the final magnitude." Since mid-June, corn prices have jumped by 60 percent and soybean meal prices by 25 percent.
 And according to the USDA, 82-92 percent of the pastures in Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado are in very poor or poor condition.
 The lack of available feed crops and forages and the high prices for what is available have forced many producers to start culling their herds.
 As more cattle have entered the market, the value of calves and feeder cattle has fallen. "In the wake of high feed prices and uncertainty regarding forage availability, calf and feeder cattle prices plummeted," Hurt said.
 For example, Oklahoma steer calf prices were $173 per hundredweight in mid-June but fell to $138 in late July. A $35 per hundredweight decline on a 550-pound calf is a nearly $200 per-head value reduction.
 "Multiplying that across a national calf crop of 34.5 million head totals a potential decline in value of nearly $7 billion," he said.
 "It is still too early to count the actual damages, but this illustration shows it's likely large." The silver lining, Hurt said, could be for producers who are able to weather the financial storm and hold onto their herds.
 As cattle numbers fall below beef consumer demand, prices should rebound. Producers likely best positioned to keep their herds are those who locked in lower feed prices in the spring.
 That would mostly include large feedlots that tend to hedge on feed and feed cost and profit margins. "The message for cow-calf producers is to hold onto the cows if possible," Hurt said.
 "The short-term losses of the next 12 to 14 months will be replaced by large profits in late-2013, 2014 and 2015." Hurt said the anticipated "golden days" are based on reductions in per-capita beef supplies, leading to higher retail beef prices, and an expected return to more normal crop conditions in 2013.
 While that could revive some optimism in the cattle industry, Hurt was quick to point out that most thoughts of herd expansion would be pushed off until late 2013.
 "The exception is for producers in areas of the country that have abundant forages," he said. "For them, buying cows sold this fall from distressed owners appears to be a strategic move.

 Regenstrief launches hospital research community to improve infusion pump drug-delivery system
 Cindy Gaston, at right, senior clinical pharmacist for the University of Wisconsin Hospital & Clinics in Madison, discusses the importance of safety standards for the use of infusion pumps at a meeting of the Infusion Pump Informatics Community, while Jim Young, quality assurance/process improvement pharmacist at Wishard in Indianapolis, listens.
 (Purdue University photo/Phillip Fiorini) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Purdue University research center is working with major Midwestern hospitals to establish safety standards for infusion pumps, which have become commonplace in the past decade for administering drugs to patients.
 The Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering, a Discovery Park center focused on improving health-care delivery, has partnered with hospitals in Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Wisconsin to launch the Infusion Pump Informatics Community at Purdue.
 Through its Web-based tool, users can easily share analysis, data reporting and best practices for what are known as "smart pumps.
" Participating hospitals are Community Health Network, Franciscan St. Francis Health, Wishard Health Services, Indiana University Health and St.
 Vincent Health, the Roudebush Veterans Medical Center, and St. Vincent Health, all based in Indianapolis; Witham Health Services, based in Lebanon, Ind.; University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City; University of Wisconsin Health & Clinics in Madison; and Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.
 "Infusion pumps present benefits and risks. They have allowed for a greater level of control, accuracy and precision in drug delivery, thereby reducing medication errors and contributing to improvements in patient care," says Steve Witz, director of the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering at Purdue.
 "At the same time, infusion pumps have been associated with safety problems. We believe that Purdue's Regenstrief Center can help bring together key players in hospitals to address this national concern by putting research into practice.

 (Purdue University photo/Phillip Fiorini) Infusion pumps offer a variety of designs to intravenously deliver nutrition, fluids and drugs like pain medications, insulin and cancer treatments.
 Today, an estimated 2 million infusion pumps are in hospitals and clinics and thousands more are used by patients in their homes.
 The pumps come with a programmable computer to control the rate and volume of medication flow, which can vary depending on the patient's illness, weight, age and other factors.
 A doctor, nurse or other health-care worker enters information on the infusion pump's keypad. Despite their advantages, the FDA reports that infusion pumps were linked to more than 56,000 adverse event reports from 2005-2009, including at least 500 deaths.
 Cindy Gaston, senior clinical pharmacist for the University of Wisconsin Hospital & Clinics in Madison, says the Purdue-led community has been helpful in sparking discussion from hospital personnel in different environments who have diverse experiences and different vantage points.
 "We're all human, and we make mistakes," Gaston says. "When we're programming numbers into a pump, we can make an error. Many times, those errors won't cause patient harm, but it can be one or two times that it does cause severe patient harm, ultimately resulting in death.
 "If we can prevent those deaths and improve our use of infusion pumps, it's a very worthwhile project that Purdue is leading." In 2010 the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration released guidelines designed to improve safety as part of its Infusion Pump Improvement Initiative, which proposed stricter regulation of pumps and cited software defects, user interface issues and mechanical or electrical failures as main causes of adverse events.
 Infusion pump manufacturers say most problems stem from a nurse or health-care worker accidentally entering the wrong data. But the FDA and hospital officials say the deaths and injuries were because of engineering and design defects of the devices.
 That was the driving force behind Regenstrief's efforts to create the group to examine the problems with smart pumps and find solutions.
 Beverly Vermace, parental infusion device coordinator and a registered nurse at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, says the Purdue network has allowed her hospital system to work through existing hurdles encountered with the use of smart pumps while being proactive in avoiding potential hurdles learned from other hospitals.
 "With all health-care technology, we cannot remove the human element," Vermace says. "Technology needs to be designed to allow the clinician to do safe patient care.
 When that happens, patient outcomes will improve." A team led by Ann Christine Catlin, a research scientist in Purdue's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, developed the Web-based tool called the Infusion Pump Informatics System.
 The initiative uses Purdue's innovative HUBzero website platform to host the tool, tutorials, Q&A forums, and other educational and research resources, all accessible via a Web page.
 Jim Young, quality assurance/process improvement pharmacist at Wishard, says that through the group led by Purdue, hospitals can share individual processes for getting a better understanding about how to set guidelines and limits for dosages and concentrations of medication.
 Young, whose hospital system began using wireless infusion pumps in 2010, says pharmacists can learn a lot about their proper use by talking to the nurses and vice versa.
 "The interaction with this community is helping us improve that communication process to make sure we can give our patients the best possible care," he says.
 "We're writing the textbook here through the interactions with this community of hospitals." Vermace at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics says the community also provides a form of encouragement for hospital administrators and staff who know other hospitals have similar issues and are committed to find solutions.
 "We get good ideas such as what has worked from the lessons learned, why pharmacists and nurses must work together more effectively," she says.
 "Another advantage is the rapid response to questions asked and immediate contact with people with a shared experience." Kathy Rapala is now vice president of clinical risk management at Aurora Health Care in Wisconsin.
 She first began looking into ways to address the infusion pump problem for hospital staff while pursuing her doctorate of nursing practice at Purdue in 2008.
 Through the Indianapolis Coalition for Patient Safety, she submitted a grant to Cardinal Health with the vision of linking the smart pump databases of the Indianapolis hospitals.
 "It's exciting when an idea takes off," Rapala says. "To work with data on one platform with diverse organizations is a great step forward in understanding a device and the interaction with the care environment.
 The learning environment that Purdue has created around the data platform will further that understanding and research." Community participants say they are convinced a continued focus on this national patient safety issue, building on the research and data collection under way at Purdue, will give hospitals the necessary tools to improve use of infusion pumps, spark ideas to improve the use of guardrails on the devices, minimize alerts and grow their acceptance.
 "The stakes are high," Wishard's Young says. "This community established by Purdue's Regenstrief Center and involving these many hospitals is helping us improve our patient safety measures and saving lives.
" The Indianapolis-based Regenstrief Foundation provided $3 million to launch the Regenstrief Center in 2005 and awarded an additional $11 million grant in April 2008 to expand and extend its partnership.
 The foundation's work supports the legacy of Sam Regenstrief's vision: The continued improvement of the health-care delivery system.

 Report: Corn ethanol waiver's effect on corn prices uncertain
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Corn prices pushed higher by the worst U.S. drought in half a century would not necessarily moderate if the federal government's corn ethanol mandate were temporarily suspended, according to a report by 
Purdue University agricultural economists. The report, "Potential Impacts of a Partial Waiver of the Ethanol Blending Rules," suggests that corn prices could fall under some scenarios should the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency grant a partial waiver of the Renewable Fuel Standard's corn ethanol provision - but only under certain market conditions.
 The EPA received a request by a consortium of livestock industry organizations to waive part of the mandate that effectively requires corn ethanol be blended with gasoline.
 The Purdue report will be available Wednesday (Aug. 15) on the Farm Foundation website at http://www.farmfoundation.org/. Farm Foundation NFP is an Oak Brook, Ill.
-based not-for-profit organization conducting public policy education for food, agriculture and rural communities. The authors will discuss their report during a live webcast Thursday (Aug.
 16). A waiver could, under certain conditions, reduce the demand for corn and, thus, corn prices for livestock producers and other non-ethanol corn buyers.
 Under its normal schedule the EPA has until October to gather information on the extent of any economic harm done by the original Renewable Fuel Standard level and to decide if it will issue a waiver.
 For consumers, the decision could affect what they pay for fuel and food. "The range of impact of an RFS waiver goes from zero to $1.30 per bushel for corn," said Wally Tyner, an energy policy specialist and the report's lead author.
 With corn crops shriveling in the field and yield projections dropping almost weekly, corn prices have jumped 60 percent since June 15.
 A bushel of corn has topped $8. The prospect of a diminished crop and even higher corn prices has livestock producers worried that corn might not be available or will be too expensive to buy.
 Corn is a feed mainstay for most livestock operations. This year the RFS mandates oil companies blend 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol with the gasoline they produce.
 The mandate increases to 13.8 billion gallons in 2013. Because oil companies blended 2.6 billion gallons of ethanol with gasoline above what was required in previous years, they have built up blending credits - known as renewable identification numbers, or RINs - allowing them to count those gallons toward blending totals in this or future years.
 In the Purdue study, Tyner, along with fellow agricultural economists Chris Hurt and Farzad Taheripour, looked at future corn and ethanol prices with and without an RFS waiver, how RINs and crude oil prices could factor in ethanol use, and what might occur if the drought worsens.
 "If corn prices remain high, which seems likely, and crude oil remains at $100 a barrel or lower, then reducing the RFS could reduce the demand for ethanol and, consequently, the demand for corn," Tyner said.
 "If the waiver resulted in less demand for ethanol that would, in turn, lead to lower corn prices than would have existed without the waiver.
 It also could lead to more ethanol plant closings - at least temporarily." Conversely, an EPA waiver could have little effect if crude oil moves beyond $120 a barrel and oil companies continue blending ethanol at current levels, Tyner said.
 The severity of drought moving forward adds another layer of complexity to the issue, the Purdue economists said. At the start of the crop season, U.S.
 corn production was projected at 14.7 billion bushels at a U.S. farm price of $5.34 per bushel. The USDA now estimates U.S. corn production will reach only 10.8 billion bushels this year, at $8.20 a bushel.
 Should the drought strengthen and the EPA sticks to the mandated 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2013, a corn crop of 10.5 billion bushels could push corn prices to $8.57 per bushel, according to the Purdue report.
 If drought conditions abate and corn production reaches 11.5 billion bushels, corn prices could fall to $7.02 a bushel under a full RFS ethanol mandate.
 "However, because of carry-forward blending credits from prior years - the RINs - refiners and blenders could decide to produce and blend 2 billion fewer gallons of ethanol," Tyner said.
 "That change alone could reduce the price of corn around 67 cents a bushel. And that is without any EPA waiver." "It will have to determine what impact issuance of a waiver actually would have, given the way the market functions at present," he said.
 "For technical and economic reasons, refiners may well continue to use nearly the same amount of ethanol even if they are not required to because of a waiver.
 Technically, they may not want to change their current mix of gasoline and ethanol to make 87-octane gasoline, as an example. Economically, they would not be expected to reduce ethanol use as long as ethanol prices are below gasoline, as they are now.
 If refiners and blenders don't have or choose not to use operating flexibility, and if reduced use of ethanol is not economical, then a waiver would have no impact.
 "To the extent that refiners and blenders do have flexibility with their use of ethanol, a small waiver could reduce corn prices around 47 cents a bushel, while a large waiver could reduce it as much as $1.30 a bushel, depending on economic conditions.
" Should a waiver lead to reduced ethanol use, the EPA could have an influence on who bears the brunt of the drought-related corn losses, Tyner said.
 "The total amount of harm from the drought is in the tens of billions of dollars," he said. "The EPA cannot change the loss. It can only potentially redistribute it among the affected parties: ethanol producers, livestock producers, corn growers, and domestic and foreign consumers.

 Research: Fungicides helpful when diseases are present
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Applying fungicides to soybeans free of foliar disease problems isn't likely to help alleviate drought stress and could contribute to fungicide-resistant diseases, says a Purdue Extension plant pathologist.
 Soybean growers probably are feeling pressure to apply fungicides as the crop enters the R3 growth stage, regardless of disease presence, based on claims that the products can reduce drought stress, increase photosynthesis and, ultimately, increase yields.
 "We've done research on fungicides in the absence of disease for several years now at Purdue. What we've found is that when we don't have disease pressure there - foliar diseases such as frogeye leaf spot or Cercospora leaf blight - we don't often see an economic benefit from a fungicide application," Kiersten Wise said.
 "We know that with soybean prices what they are, that benefit would be something to really capitalize on this year. But we just don't see a consistent response, so it makes it very hard to recommend those fungicides in the absence of disease.
" Many foliar diseases struggle to develop in hot, dry weather, so this year's excessive heat and drought have kept most at bay in fields that aren't irrigated and haven't had much rainfall.
 In addition to the lack of profitability, Wise said applying unnecessary fungicides also could lead to fungicide-resistant diseases.
 One example is frogeye leaf spot, a major disease of soybeans that already has resistant populations in five Midwestern and Southern states.
 "One of the big drawbacks to using fungicides for these plant-health benefits is that when we use the same mode of action over and over again, we select for fungicide-resistant strains of the fungus," Wise said.
 "Our standard recommendation is that fungicides should be applied only when foliar disease pressure is potentially yield-limiting.
" More information and research results are available via Purdue Extension's Aug. 3 Pest and Crop Newsletter in Wise's article "Fungicide Applications in Soybean - Risk vs.
 Reward" at http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/pestcrop/2012/issue19/index.html#fungicide

 'Research powerhouses' join forces in new multistate venture
 FORT WAYNE, Ind. - Faculty from Michigan State University, Ohio State University and Purdue University gathered earlier this month in a new effort to strengthen both research and Extension outreach in food safety issues.
 "These are all exceptional agriculture institutions in their own right, but when you combine them you suddenly have a phenomenal research and Extension powerhouse," said John Baker, associate director of MSU AgBioResearch.
 "We're striving to stimulate and develop our regional efforts by honing in on the synergy across these three universities." The Food Safety Midwest Workshop last week in 
Fort Wayne, Ind., was the first such gathering of the new Tri-State Research/Extension Funding Program (TSREFP), aimed at bringing together the strengths of each university to maximize opportunities to secure grants from external agencies.
 Another benefit is providing important educational and Extension outreach programs to stakeholders. Besides food safety, six other focus areas are part of the new venture: bioenergy and bioproducts, local foods, water quality, nutrient and waste management, animal welfare, and commercial agriculture and farm management.
 Jeff LeJeune, microbiologist with Ohio State University Extension and Ohio State's Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, attended the Sept.
 13 food safety workshop. "We identified some priorities in areas where we might work together, and one of them was in educational materials for Good Agricultural Practices for producers," LeJeune said.
 "The day after the meeting, we already shared ideas back and forth from information that was presented at the workshop. We're talking about how we can adopt things here in Ohio that are being done in Indiana and Michigan, and how what we're doing in Ohio can be exported, if you will, to Indiana and Michigan.
 The collaboration is already moving ahead." Karen Plaut, director of Agricultural Research Programs at Purdue, said the tri-state initiative is an ideal way to use a broad array of expertise to improve the health and well-being of people in the Midwest.
 "By combining the knowledge at these institutions, we can give producers the tools they need to ensure a safe and healthy food supply, which is what consumers deserve and have come to expect," Plaut said.
 "We can do more together, and that benefits everyone." The group is soliciting new project proposals from faculty at the three institutions for funding consideration.
 "By working together and crossing boundaries, we often have an even greater impact than going it alone," Baker said.

 Researcher's fish-eye view could offer insights for human vision
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Purdue University student's research project related to zebrafish eye development could lead to a better understanding of vision problems that affect billions of people worldwide.
 Zeran Li, as an undergraduate student in biological sciences, led a research team that uncovered an enzyme's role in the regulation of eye size in the fish.
 If the enzyme's role is similar in human eyes, it could be relevant to human vision problems, such as nearsightedness and farsightedness.
 "New insights into the process of eye-size control in zebrafish may help our understanding of the regulation of eye size in humans," said Li, who has since graduated and is pursuing a doctorate in neuroscience at Washington University.
 "Vision problems occur when the size or shape of the eye changes, and what causes this is unclear. Perhaps this research will lead to a better understanding of this mechanism and the discovery of a new treatment for these problems.
" These vision problems, called refractive errors, occur because the physical length of the eye from the cornea to the retina is different from the optical length.
 If an eye is too long or too short, light is focused in front of or behind the retina and vision is blurred, she said. Refractive errors affect 3.8 billion people worldwide, according to the International Center for Eye Education.
 Li worked in the laboratory of Yuk Fai Leung, a Purdue assistant professor of biological sciences. Leung oversaw the research and guided the team, but credits the two undergraduate students in his lab for the idea.
 "The inspiration for this study came from the undergraduate students," he said. "Their observations and interpretations helped shape our current focus and allowed us to make this discovery.
 I'm very proud of the scientists they are becoming." The findings are detailed in a paper in PLoS ONE. In addition to Li and Leung, paper co-authors include Purdue undergraduate student Devon Ptak, postdoctoral researchers Liyun Zhang and Wenxuan Zhong, and continuing lecturer Elwood Walls.
 Zebrafish are used as a model to study development and growth problems. The zebrafish, which are named for their naturally occurring black stripes, must be made transparent to enable the careful observation and imaging necessary for the research.
 The most common way to achieve this transparency is to treat zebrafish embryos with a chemical called phenylthiourea that blocks the formation of black pigment, he said.
 Li had previously observed that zebrafish embryos treated with the chemical have smaller eyes than untreated fish, and found that in addition to blocking pigmentation, the chemical inhibits thyroid activity.
 The thyroid produces hormones that regulate metabolism and influence growth, and it was thought that a general suppression of the thyroid hormone could be causing the reduction in eye size.
 Li theorized that phenylthiourea might suppress thyroid hormone production because it shares the same structure as a known thyroid hormone inhibitor.
 She tested the effects of several different inhibitors and found that not all had the same effect on eye growth. Only those that halted production of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase resulted in smaller eye size.
 "If thyroid peroxidase has a specific role in the regulation of eye growth, it would be logical for it to express in the eye," Leung said.
 "Perhaps a localized manipulation of its activity in the eye could be used as a strategy to correct some vision problems. Of course, first we must learn much more about how it regulates eye size.
" The findings also serve as a warning of the potential changes phenylthiourea may have on zebrafish - a widely used animal model - that could affect research results, he said.
 "Our findings and others have shown that phenylthiourea can affect various aspects of physiology, so the results obtained from fish treated with it may not truly reflect what is going on inside the embryo," Leung said.
 "One should be cautious in interpreting their findings after phenylthiourea treatment. This discovery highlights the need to find a new way to remove pigmentation.
" Leung's group attempted to find an alternative inhibitor for pigmentation, but all caused physiological problems and none were as efficient as phenylthiourea, he said.
 The team plans to further investigate the relationship of thyroid peroxidase and thyroid hormone on eye growth and development. 
 Leung said the team also is analyzing the effects of traditional Chinese medicines considered good for vision using fish models of human retinal degeneration.
 "Hopefully our efforts will expedite the discovery of novel treatments for human eye diseases," he said. Li and Ptak received national Sigma Xi awards for vision research.
 Li also was a recipient of a Sandy and Zippy Ostroy Research Experience for Undergraduates Award and a Dr. William H. Phillips Undergraduate Research Internship.
 In addition to those awards, this research was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Energy.
 Phenylthiourea (PTU) is commonly used for inhibiting melanization of zebrafish embryos. In this study, the standard treatment with 0.2 mM PTU was demonstrated to specifically reduce eye size in larval fish starting at three days post-fertilization.
 This effect is likely the result of a reduction in retinal and lens size of PTU-treated eyes and is not related to melanization inhibition.
 This is because the eye size of tyr, a genetic mutant of tyrosinase whose activity is inhibited in PTU treatment, was not reduced.
 As PTU contains a thiocarbamide group, which is presented in many goitrogens, suppressing thyroid hormone production is a possible mechanism by which PTU treatment may reduce eye size.
 Despite the fact that thyroxine level was found to be reduced in PTU-treated larvae, thyroid hormone supplements did not rescue the eye size reduction.
 Instead, treating embryos with six goitrogens, including inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), suggested an alternative possibility.
 Specifically, three TPO inhibitors, including those that do not possess thiocarbamide, specifically reduced eye size; whereas none of the NIS inhibitors could elicit this effect.
 These observations indicate that TPO inhibition rather than a general suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis is likely the underlying cause of PTU-induced eye size reduction.
 Furthermore, the tissue-specific effect of PTU treatment might be mediated by an eye-specific TPO expression. Compared with treatment with other tyrosinase inhibitors or bleaching to remove melanization, PTU treatment remains the most effective approach.
 Thus, one should use caution when interpreting results that are obtained from PTU-treated embryos.

 Researchers: Sorghum should be in the mix as a biofuel crop
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Sweet and biomass sorghum would meet the need for next-generation biofuels to be environmentally sustainable, easily adopted by producers and take advantage of existing agricultural infrastructure, a group of researchers led by Purdue University scientists believes.
 The scientists from Purdue, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, University of Illinois and Cornell University believe sorghum, a grain crop similar to corn, could benefit from the rail system, grain elevators and corn ethanol processing facilities already in place.
 Their perspective article is published early online in the journal Biofuels, Bioproducts & Biorefining. "The Midwest is uniquely poised to get the biorefining industry going on cellulose," said Nick Carpita, a Purdue professor of botany and plant pathology.
 "As we move to different fuels beyond ethanol, the ethanol plants of today are equipped to take advantage of new bioenergy crops.
" The scientists argue that no single plant is a silver-bullet answer to biofuels, but sorghum should be a larger part of the conversation than it is today.
 Cliff Weil, a Purdue professor of agronomy, said some types of sorghum would require fewer inputs and could be grown on marginal lands.
 "In the near future, we need a feedstock that is not corn," Weil said. "Sweet and biomass sorghum meet all the criteria. They use less nitrogen, grow well and grow where other things don't grow.
" The ability to minimize inputs such as nitrogen could be a key to sorghum's benefits as a bioenergy crop. Carpita said corn, which has been bred to produce a maximum amount of seed, requires a lot of nitrogen.
 But sorghum could be genetically developed in a way that maximizes cellulose, minimizes seeds and, therefore, minimizes inputs. 
"If you're just producing biomass and not seed, you don't need as much nitrogen," Carpita said. Farmers may also be more willing to grow sorghum - a crop they're familiar with - because it is an annual, compared with perennials such as switchgrass or Miscanthus, that would take up a field for a decade or longer.
 Sorghum would fit in a normal crop rotation with food crops rather than tying up valuable cropland. "If we're talking about planting switchgrass, that's a 15-year commitment," said Nathan Mosier, a Purdue associate professor of agricultural and biological engineering.
 "You can't switch annually based on the economy or other factors. You are committed to that crop." Conversion processes for turning biomass into fuel need to be scalable and take advantage of existing infrastructure for grain production, said Maureen McCann, a Purdue professor of biology and director of the 
Energy Center and the Center for Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Biofuels. Sorghum could be harvested and transported using existing rail lines to collection points such as grain elevators, where the crop could be processed to a higher-value, more energy-dense product before being transported for further processing in a refinery.
 "Biomass has roughly half the energy content of gasoline - even if it's very compressed and tightly packed. The issue is really how to increase the intrinsic energy density by preprocessing conversion steps that could be done on farm or at the silo so that you're transporting higher-energy products to the refineries," McCann said.
 Farzad Taheripour, a Purdue research assistant professor of agricultural economics, said bringing sorghum back as a biofuel crop could have an economic impact on poorer rural areas of the country.
 "Given that sorghum can be produced on low-quality, marginal lands in dry areas, producing sorghum for biofuel will significantly improve the economy of rural areas that rely on low-productivity agriculture," Taheripour said.
 "This could improve welfare in less-developed rural areas and increase job opportunities in these areas." Purdue Agriculture researchers are continuing to look at how bioenergy crops could be deployed into the agricultural landscape.
 Work in the Center for Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Biofuels continues to develop a knowledge base for chemical and thermal conversion technologies that might be able to take advantage of the Midwest's transportation infrastructure.

 Corn grain ethanol production is a mature industry built on a Midwestern agricultural infrastructure. Second- and third-generation biofuels and bio-based products industries could take advantage of this robust framework.
 Significant but not insurmountable barriers remain for grower acceptance of bioenergy crop plants and capital investment in transitioning from grain to lignocellulosic biomass at scale.
 The existing infrastructure in the Midwest provides a model for implementing an environmentally responsible and sustainable next-generation biofuels industry into the agro-economy.

 Restaurant smoking bans help snuff out European youth smoking
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Teenagers and young adults are less likely to smoke when faced with restaurant smoking bans and minimum tobacco-purchase ages in Europe, according to new research by a Purdue University sociologist.
 "Policies that restrict smoking directly affect young people's behavior, and that may be a key element to curb smoking rates because most adult smokers report starting when they were teenagers," says Mike Vuolo, an assistant professor of sociology who studies youth behavior.
 "In countries with restaurant smoking bans, young people were 35 percent less likely to smoke regularly." Most studies look at individual factors, such as income and education levels and smoking rates, but this study also examined policies and other social influences, such as antismoking messages in mass media and cigarette taxes.
 The article is published in a recent issue of Social Forces. The results are based on self-reported cigarette use of people ages 15-24 in the original 15 European Union countries, and the data is from Eurostat, the European Commission's statistics branch, and the World Health Organization.
 The survey information was collected in the spring of 2002, and there were 7,532 respondents with an average of 450 respondents per country.
 "Enforcing a law certainly plays a role in influencing behavior," Vuolo said. "While the bans and policies create a physical obstacle to smoking, they also add a stigma that likely contributes to deterring young people from the habit.
" The study also found that local taxes and anti-tobacco campaigns were less effective in reducing smoking than bans and age limits.
 "Strategies that rely on a personal cost or a cry to change behavior, such as taxes or anti-smoking posters, weren't as likely to curb cigarette use as policies do," he said.
 "However, a long-term study that looks at the impact of each effort is needed to better understand how sociological factors contribute to individual behavior.
" Because the 18-year-old minimum purchase age in the United States is universal, this finding is not as applicable as in Europe, when, at the time of the 2002 data collection, the restricted ages varied by regions.
 At that time, six countries had no minimum purchase age; three countries required consumers to be 18; and six countries required age 16.
 In countries with no minimum purchase age, the probability of a young person smoking regularly was about 46 percent, compared to 30 percent in countries with age restrictions.
 "Considering that most adult smokers start smoking when they are teenagers, these laws and bans can be a first step to discouraging young people from smoking," he said.

apatterson@purdue.edu ABSTRACT Placing Deviance in a Legal and Logical Context: A Multilevel Analysis of Cigarette Use in the European Union
 Though it has produced a high-quality body of research, the study of substance use has remained highly individualized in its focus.
 This paper adds further sociological understanding to that research. Using hierarchical methods, the following explores how institutional and criminological theories can be incorporated into substance use research by examining cigarette smoking at three levels of variation.
 Two main findings emerge. First, national legal context plays a role in understanding individual-level probabilities of substance use, even after controlling for individual and local characteristics.
 For example, lower probabilities of smoking occur where there are smoking bans and minimum purchase ages. Second, the effects of local context, such as unemployment and the percentage of young people, exhibit significant effects of individual-level cigarette use.

 Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship. Filatova, Korsokov and eight other Russian undergraduate students are at Purdue this month through the Yegor Gaidar Summer Leadership Program, a joint project between the Yegor Gaidar Foundation and U.S.
 Russian Foundation. (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A group of Russian undergraduate students are spending most of this month at Purdue University to expand their understanding of how to take a creative idea and turn it into a viable business venture.
 Ten students from the Yegor Gaidar Summer Leadership Program will tour Purdue's research facilities, technology transfer offices and business incubators.
 Meetings are planned to discuss potential collaborations with researchers in Discovery Park and elsewhere on campus, as well as graduate students, faculty members and entrepreneurs at 
Purdue Research Park. Discovery Park leaders have planned meetings with Purdue student entrepreneurs and faculty, as well as graduate students, faculty members and entrepreneurs at Purdue Research Park.
 The program provides opportunities for Purdue students and these competitively selected Russian students to exchange cultural information and discuss entrepreneurship with a global perspective.
 The students also will work in teams on a business case to commercialize a new or enhanced product. Teams will determine the best way to establish a startup by developing a business plan, building a management team, identifying capital needs and creating a marketing strategy.
 "This entrepreneurship program is a great opportunity for the Russian undergraduate students to experience entrepreneurship in the United States," said Joseph Hornett, senior vice president, treasurer and COO of the Purdue Research Foundation.
 "In addition, the three-week program represents an important collaboration among Purdue and Russian students and leaders to learn best business practices from each other.
" The program, funded by the U.S. Russia Foundation and the Yegor Gaidar Foundation, culminates when the Russian students will deliver business-plan presentations on their ideas from 9 a.m.
 to noon on Friday, July 27, in Discovery Park's Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, Room 129. A formal reception to recognize the Russian students also is set for 6:30 p.m.
 Thursday, July 26, in the Hall for Discovery and Learning Research, First Floor Atrium. Purdue aeronautics and astronautics professor Alina Alexeenko, a native of Russia, is the keynote speaker for the event.
 She received bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics from Novosibirsk State University before gaining her doctorate degree in aerospace engineering from Pennsylvania State University.
 "The enthusiasm of these young Russian students is contagious, as they access the many resources focused on entrepreneurship here at Purdue and through the Purdue Research Park," said Alan H.
 Rebar, executive director of Discovery Park and senior associate vice president for research at Purdue. "We see benefits in terms of large university global partnerships with Russia.
 They learn from us and we learn, as well, from these entrepreneurially minded Russian students." The students' business plan project is modeled after the Purdue Research Park Entrepreneurship Academy, a program established in 2007 that introduces young people to the world of entrepreneurship.
 The program is operated by the Purdue Research Foundation and managed by Tim Peoples, director of Purdue Technology Centers of West Lafayette, and Juliana Spiker, academy coordinator.
 As part of the program, Alya Rahmatullina, who handles editorial and website content responsibilities for the U.S. Russian Foundation, will participate in a two-week marketing and media training workshop, led by Purdue Marketing & Media and Discovery Park.
 Rahmatullina, who joined the U.S. Russian Foundaiton in early 2011, holds a linguistics degree from Moscow State Pedagogical University and is working on her doctorate degree in linguocultural studies.
"The world is getting smaller and smaller, and this has provided Purdue with a terrific opportunity for exchanging information and creating substantive partnerships," said Candiss Vibbert, associate director for the Discovery Park Office of Engagement who has worked with the 
EURECA project since its inception in 2009. A new Russian federal law gave Russian universities control over their intellectual property in 2009, allowing for the creation of small companies on campuses.
 This action dovetails with the U.S. Bayh-Dole Act, signed into law in 1980. The Yegor Gaidar Summer Leadership Program is a joint project between the Yegor Gaidar Foundation and U.S.
 Russian Foundation, designed to assist Russian undergraduate students with the knowledge, skills and practical experience in the area of economic and business development, with a focus on economics and entrepreneurship.
 The U.S. Russia Foundation is working to support the long-term economic development of Russia's economy, working closely with the Russian government and leading Russian institutions.
 In this way, the foundation seeks to build strong ties between the United States and Russia. In addition to this program, the U.S.
 Russia Foundation is funding the Enhancing University Research and Entrepreneurial Capacity, or EURECA, program. In addition to Purdue, that collaboration includes the universities of California-Los Angeles, Maryland and Washington, and a consortium of program operators.
 Purdue projects through EURECA, which was launched in 2009, are focusing on ways to determine the value of university-led intellectual property, faculty and student exchanges, joint incubators and technology centers, venture capital participation in student startups, technology transfer certification programs, and incubation of professional tech-transfer associations.

 Science on Tap talk to focus on misconceptions of animal use in medical research
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A University of Illinois at Chicago veterinary medicine researcher will discuss the misconceptions that exist in the use of animals in medical research during Thursday's (July 19) 
Science on Tap. Dr. Elizabeth Nunamaker, who completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Purdue Center for Paralysis Research, will speak at 6 p.m.
 in the upstairs of the Lafayette Brewing Company, 622 Main St., Lafayette. Her talk is titled "Laboratory Animal Medicine: Dispelling the Misconceptions.
" The Science on Tap event is free and open to those 21 and older. "More than 26 million animals are used in research every year in the United States alone.
 As a direct result, today people are living longer, healthier lives," Nunamaker said. "Unfortunately, public perception of animal research is misguided by sensationalized media coverage and propaganda rather than accurate reports of the excellent and humane laboratory animal veterinary care.
" Sponsors for the talk are the College of Veterinary Medicine, Discovery Park and Purdue University. Nunamaker, a laboratory animal medicine postdoctoral veterinarian in the Biological Resources Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago, points to federal regulations that are in place to protect these animals.
 She also said most clinicians, investigators and technicians who work with animals for research are highly trained and dedicated to protecting and promoting the health and welfare of these animals.
 Her talk also will highlight the variety of species seen in research, how they are used, how they are cared for and protected, and how the research community is continuously striving to improve laboratory animal welfare.
 Nunamaker received her doctorate in veterinary medicine from Purdue in 2010 after completing her doctorate at the University of Michigan and earning a master's degree from Northwestern University, both in biomedical engineering.
 She received a bachelor's degree in bioengineering in 2000 from Arizona State University. The Science on Tap lecture series, led by Purdue graduate students Patrick Dolan, Shaili Sharma and Becca Scott, provides Purdue faculty and collaborating researchers the opportunity to share research activities in an informal setting, with presentations that are designed to appeal to a more general audience.

 Science on Tap talk to focus on researching next generation of engines

 (Purdue News Service photo)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Purdue University mechanical engineer will speak Thursday (Aug.
 23) about a new type of engine his team is developing that could dramatically reduce oil consumption and the emission of global-warming pollutants.
 Gregory M. Shaver, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, will speak as part of Science on Tap at 6 p.m. in the upstairs of the Lafayette Brewing Company, 622 Main St.
, Lafayette. His talk is titled "Development of High Efficiency, Environmentally Friendly Vehicles." &#8232;&#8232;"Students and faculty at Purdue are engaged in research and educational activities focused on the development of high efficiency, environmentally friendly vehicles," Shaver said.
 "The upcoming Science on Tap presentation will provide an overview of these activities, with specific examples regarding next generation, fuel-flexible internal combustion engines and the Purdue EcoCAR2 student team activities.
" Shaver's research hinges on designing engines so that their intake and exhaust valves are no longer driven by mechanisms connected to the pistons.
 The innovation would be a departure from the way automotive engines have worked since they were commercialized more than a century ago.
 In today's internal combustion engines, the pistons turn a crankshaft, which is linked to a camshaft that opens and closes the valves, directing the flow of air and exhaust into and out of the cylinders.
 The new method would eliminate the mechanism linking the crankshaft to the camshaft, providing an independent control system for the valves.
 Because the valves' timing would no longer be restricted by the pistons' movement, they could be more finely tuned to allow more efficient combustion of diesel, gasoline and alternative fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, Shaver said.
 The concept, known as variable valve actuation, would enable significant improvements in conventional gasoline and diesel engines used in cars and trucks and for applications such as generators.
 EcoCAR 2 is a three-year intercollegiate engineering competition, challenging 15 universities across North America to reduce the environmental impact of a Chevrolet Malibu.
 The goal: to design, construct and incorporate technologies in a vehicle that reduce petroleum energy consumption, well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions and criteria tailpipe emissions while maintaining consumer acceptability in the areas of performance, utility and safety.
 Shaver, who has five patents, focuses his research on modeling and control of advanced combustion processes and engine technologies, as well as power-train control strategies that enable the efficient and clean use of conventional fuels, coal-derived fuels and biofuels.
 Undergraduate and graduate students in Shaver's research group, based at Purdue's Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, also are working to develop engines that efficiently combust fuels that contain higher concentrations of biofuels, aiming to reduce nitrogen oxides and fuel consumption.
 Shaver's research group sponsors include Cummins, Eaton and the U.S. Department of Energy. He also is affiliated with Purdue's Energy Center in Discovery Park.
 Shaver is a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), participating in the ASME Dynamic Systems and Controls Division and the ASME Automotive and Transportation Systems Panel.
 In addition, he is an associate editor for the IFAC Control Engineering Practice journal and the ASME Journal of Dynamics Systems and Control.
 Shaver received the Kalman award for the best paper published in the Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control, and is a recent awardee of the 2012 SAE Max Bentele Award for Engine Technology Innovation.
 He received a doctorate and master's degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford University after completing a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at Purdue in 2000.

 Scientists have way to control sugars that lead to diabetes, obesity
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Scientists can now turn on or off the enzymes responsible for processing starchy foods into sugars in the human digestive system, a finding they believe will allow them to better control those processes in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity.
 Bruce Hamaker, a professor of food science and director of the Whistler Center for Carbohydrate Research at Purdue University, said the four small intestine enzymes, called alpha-glucosidases, are responsible for generating glucose from starch digestion.
 Each enzyme functions differently, breaking down starches into different sugars at different rates. Someone missing one or more of those enzymes creates glucose improperly.
 Influx of glucose to the blood increases insulin release from the pancreas, which allows the body to remove the sugar. When the body's tissues cannot respond well to insulin, the blood sugar is not lowered, a situation seen in type 2 diabetics.
 Even in non-diabetics, excess sugars not burned by the body as energy may be stored as fat, an issue for people prone to obesity.
 "In diabetics, you don't want this roller coaster of blood-glucose levels. Their bodies can't regulate glucose that well," Hamaker said.
 "If you can selectively inhibit these enzymes, it opens up the possibility of moderating glucose to the body as well as directing glucose release into different parts of the small intestines for certain physiologic responses.
" Hamaker and Mario Pinto, professor of chemistry and vice president for research at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, members of a starch research consortium, led the study.
 Their results were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Hamaker's group did the inhibition studies on starch degradation products and the alpha-glucosidase enzymes, provided by other members of the consortium, in a simulated gastrointestinal tract system.
 The inhibitors, developed in Pinto's laboratory, were able to selectively inhibit the enzymes, a process they have called "toggling," and could lead to several solutions for diabetics or those prone to obesity.
 "We could provide the missing enzymes or develop new starches that will digest properly with the enzymes they do have," Pinto said.
 "It's all about control and using the molecular information we have to control those enzymes." Hamaker and Pinto said they would next work to understand how the inhibitors control the intestinal enzymes and refine their understanding of when and where the enzymes should be controlled for the best results.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture funded Hamaker's portion of the research. The Canadian Institute of Health Research funded Pinto's work.
 Modulation of Starch Digestion for Slow Glucose Release through 'Toggling' of Activities of Mucosal α -Glucosidases Byung-Hoo Lee, Razieh Eskandari, Kyra Jones, Kongara Ravinder Reddy, Roberto Quezada-Calvillo, Buford L.
 Nichols, David R. Rose, Bruce R. Hamaker, and B. Mario Pinto Starch digestion involves the breakdown by α -amylase to small linear and branched malto-oligosaccharides, which are in turn hydrolyzed to glucose by the mucosal α -glucosidases, maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI).
 MGAM and SI are anchored to the small intestinal brush-border epithelial cells, and each contains a catalytic N- and C-terminal subunit.
 All four subunits have α -1,4-exohydrolytic glucosidase activity, and the SI N-terminal subunit has an additional exo-debranching activity on the α -1,6-linkage.
 Inhibition of α -amylase and/or α -glucosidases is a strategy for treatment of type 2 diabetes. We illustrate here the concept of "toggling": differential inhibition of subunits to examine more refined control of glucogenesis of the α -amylolyzed starch malto-oligosaccharides with the aim of slow glucose delivery.
 Recombinant MGAM and SI subunits were individually assayed with α -amylolyzed waxy corn starch, consisting mainly of maltose, maltotriose and branched α -limit dextrins, as substrate in the presence of four different inhibitors: acarbose and three sulfonium ion compounds.
 The IC50 values show that the four α -glucosidase subunits could be differentially inhibited. The results support the prospect of controlling starch digestion rates to induce slow glucose release through the toggling of activities of the mucosal α -glucosidases by selective enzyme inhibition.
 This approach could also be used to probe associated metabolic diseases.

 Scientists uncover last steps for benzoic acid creation in plants
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University scientists have mapped the entire pathway plants use to create benzoic acid, a precursor to a number of important compounds.
 Natalia Dudareva, Distinguished Professor of Horticulture, said plants use benzoic acid to create defensive compounds and growth regulators, and to attract pollinators.
 Drugs, such as the anticancer medication Taxol, also require benzoic acid for formation. The plants make benzoic acid by modifying the chemical structure of cinnamic acid the same way many organisms break down fatty acids.
 "There's a lot of potential. It opens the door to allow scientists to engineer plants for increased benzoic acid production," said Purdue postdoctoral researcher Joshua Widhalm, one of the authors of the findings.
 "If you want to modify the amount of compounds that attract pollinators, or improve plant defense, it would be important to understand this pathway.
" Dudareva, Widhalm and former Purdue postdoctoral researcher Anthony Qualley published their results in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
 They used petunias as a model. "This completes our understanding of the steps required to create benzoic acid," Dudareva said. "Now, we can put it in textbooks.
" The chemical structure of cinnamic acid is a ring with a three-carbon chain coming off the side. The findings show that four enzymes work to remove two of those carbon molecules, resulting in benzoic acid.
 Dudareva said when she saw the complete puzzle, she realized that the process for creating benzoic acid will be quite familiar to some scientists.
 "In plants and animals, the process already exists in fatty acid oxidation," Dudareva said. "In that process, you break off two carbon units in the acids.
 This is the same." Widhalm said the finding showed the ability of plants to take a common process and adapt it for their survival.
 "Plants have taken it a step further by using this existing process to create beneficial compounds," Widhalm said. "There is a finite number of chemistries that can occur in plants, and they find combinations of these chemistries to make different products.
" The National Science Foundation funded the research. Funmilayo Adebesin and Christine Kish of Purdue collaborated on the study.
 Anthony V. Qualley, Joshua R. Widhalm, Funmilayo Adebesin, Christine M. Kish, and Natalia Dudareva Despite the importance of benzoic acid (BA) as a precursor for a wide array of primary and secondary metabolites, its biosynthesis in plants has not been fully elucidated.
 BA formation from phenylala-nine requires shortening of the C3 side chain by two carbon units, which can occur by a non–β -oxidative route and/or a β -oxidative pathway analogous to the catabolism of fatty acids.
 Enzymes responsible for the first and last reactions of the core BA β -oxidative pathway (cinnamic acid → cinnamoyl-CoA → 3-hydroxy-3-phenyl- propanoyl-CoA → 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoyl-CoA → BA-CoA) have previously been characterized in petunia, a plant with flowers rich in phenylpropanoid/benzenoid volatile compounds.
 Using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a petunia gene encoding cinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-dehydrogenase (PhCHD), a bi-functional peroxisomal enzyme responsible for two consecutively occurring unexplored intermediate steps in the core BA β -oxidative pathway.
 PhCHD spatially, developmentally, and temporally co-expresses with known genes in the BA β -oxidative pathway, and correlates with emission of benzenoid volatiles.
 Kinetic analysis of recombinant PhCHD revealed it most efficiently converts cinna- moyl-CoA to 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoyl-CoA, thus forming the substrate for the final step in the pathway.
 Down-regulation of PhCHD expression in petunia flowers resulted in reduced CHD enzyme activity, as well as decreased formation of BA-CoA, BA and their derived volatiles.
 Moreover, transgenic lines accumulated the PhCHD substrate cinnamoyl-CoA and the upstream pathway intermediate cinnamic acid. Discovery of PhCHD completes the elucidation of the core BA β -oxidative route in plants, and together with the previously characterized CoA-ligase and thiolase enzymes, provides evidence that the whole pathway occurs in peroxisomes.

 Seminar to help agribusinesses market to farmers
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Agribusiness managers can learn how to effectively market to farmers at the Strategic AgriMarketing seminar on the Purdue University campus.
 "The program will help participants learn and review critical marketing concepts that are necessary in developing strategic marketing plans for products and services that are sold directly to farmers or into the distribution system that ultimately leads to farmers," said Dave Downey, professor emeritus of agricultural economics who teaches in this seminar.
 The seminar is one of the center's longest-running programs. For more than 25 years, it has helped agribusinesses in marketing to farmers and has drawn on Purdue research on the subject.
 Participants will discover creative strategies for marketing to farmers and explore critical marketing elements while networking with professionals from a wide range of agricultural sectors.
 "They learn though lectures, case studies and a concept called modeling where they use Excel to examine a variety of 'what if' scenarios and analyze various outcomes," Downey said.
 "This is an exciting tool they can take with them and use in their own companies." Participants will discuss developing and managing comprehensive marketing plans and programs, implementing new and existing market strategies and crafting objectives for marketing teams during the seminar.
 Most importantly, they will learn how to consider a variety of promotional strategies to communicate their value to targeted audiences, Downey said.
 The program is built around case studies summarizing current marketing challenges that agribusinesses across North America face.
 Examining these cases will allow participants to see how they can apply the concepts to their operations. Also guided by Purdue faculty member Scott Downey and University of Guelph faculty members Tom Funk and Justin Funk, participants will work on case studies in teams and discuss major topics presented.
 * Product strategies: Product and service development, product differentiation, brand development and product lifecycles. * The role of price, along with price elasticity, communicating price and managing competitive pricing.
 The program is $2,895 per person. A group rate may be available for companies sending three or more employees. For more information, call 765-496-3099.

Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Researchers have created a new type of biosensor that can detect minute concentrations of glucose in saliva, tears and urine and might be manufactured at low cost because it does not require many processing steps to produce.
 "It's an inherently non-invasive way to estimate glucose content in the body," said Jonathan Claussen, a former Purdue University doctoral student and now a research scientist at the U.S.
 Naval Research Laboratory. "Because it can detect glucose in the saliva and tears, it's a platform that might eventually help to eliminate or reduce the frequency of using pinpricks for diabetes testing.
 We are proving its functionality." Claussen and Purdue doctoral student Anurag Kumar led the project, working with Timothy Fisher
, a Purdue professor of mechanical engineering; D. Marshall Porterfield, a professor of agricultural and biological engineering; and other researchers at the university's Birck Nanotechnology Center.
 Findings are detailed in a research paper being published this week in the journal Advanced Functional Materials. "Most sensors typically measure glucose in blood," Claussen said.
 "Many in the literature aren't able to detect glucose in tears and the saliva. What's unique is that we can sense in all four different human serums: the saliva, blood, tears and urine.
 And that hasn't been shown before." The paper, featured on the journal's cover, was written by Claussen, Kumar, Fisher, Porterfield and Purdue researchers David B.
 Jaroch, M. Haseeb Khawaja and Allison B. Hibbard. The sensor has three main parts: layers of nanosheets resembling tiny rose petals made of a material called graphene, which is a single-atom-thick film of carbon; platinum nanoparticles; and the enzyme glucose oxidase.
 Each petal contains a few layers of stacked graphene. The edges of the petals have dangling, incomplete chemical bonds, defects where platinum nanoparticles can attach.
 Electrodes are formed by combining the nanosheet petals and platinum nanoparticles. Then the glucose oxidase attaches to the platinum nanoparticles.
 The enzyme converts glucose to peroxide, which generates a signal on the electrode. "Typically, when you want to make a nanostructured biosensor you have to use a lot of processing steps before you reach the final biosensor product," Kumar said.
 "That involves lithography, chemical processing, etching and other steps. The good thing about these petals is that they can be grown on just about any surface, and we don't need to use any of these steps, so it could be ideal for commercialization.
" In addition to diabetes testing, the technology might be used for sensing a variety of chemical compounds to test for other medical conditions.
 "Because we used the enzyme glucose oxidase in this work, it's geared for diabetes," Claussen said. "But we could just swap out that enzyme with, for example, glutemate oxidase, to measure the neurotransmitter glutamate to test for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, or ethanol oxidase to monitor alcohol levels for a breathalyzer.
 It's very versatile, fast and portable." The technology is able to detect glucose in concentrations as low as 0.3 micromolar, far more sensitive than other electrochemical biosensors based on graphene or graphite, carbon nanotubes and metallic nanoparticles, Claussen said
 "These are the first findings to report such a low sensing limit and, at the same time, such a wide sensing range," he said. The sensor is able to distinguish between glucose and signals from other compounds that often cause interference in sensors: uric acid, ascorbic acid and acetaminophen, which are commonly found in the blood.
 Unlike glucose, those compounds are said to be electroactive, which means they generate an electrical signal without the presence of an enzyme.
 Glucose by itself doesn't generate a signal but must first react with the enzyme glucose oxidase. Glucose oxidase is used in commercial diabetes test strips for conventional diabetes meters that measure glucose with a finger pinprick.
 The research has been funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation. Note to Journalists: A copy of the research paper is available by contacting Emil Venere at 765-494-4709,

 Hybridization of nanoscale metals and carbon nanotubes into composite nanomaterials has produced some of the best-performing sensors to date.
 The challenge remains to develop scalable nanofabrication methods that are amenable to the development of sensors with broad sensing ranges.
 A scalable nanostructured biosensor based on multilayered graphene petal nanosheets (MGPNs), Pt nanoparticles, and a biorecognition element (glucose oxidase) is presented.
 The combination of zero-dimensional nano-particles on a two-dimensional support that is arrayed in the third dimension creates a sensor platform with exceptional characteristics.
 The versatility of the biosensor platform is demonstrated by altering biosensor performance (i.e., sensitivity, detection limit, and linear sensing range) through changing the size, density, and morphology of electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles on the MGPNs.
 This work enables a robust sensor design that demonstrates exceptional performance with enhanced glucose sensitivity (0.3 µM detection limit, 0.01–50 mM linear sensing range), a long stable shelf-life (> 1 month), and a high selectivity over electroactive, interfering species commonly found in human serum samples.

 Sept. 28 opening of Recreational Sports Center delayed
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The next phase for partially opening the Recreational Sports Center has been postponed from Friday (Sept.
 28) until Oct. 9 due to testing of the fire alarm systems. "We apologize for any inconvenience and for the late notice. The alarm systems were not available to be tested until just this week," said Howard Taylor, director of the 
Division of Recreational Sports. "During testing every device is activated to ensure it operates properly. The constant noise of fire alarms going on and off would not allow for an appropriate fitness and wellness atmosphere.
 "Additionally, for the safety of our users, we want to be certain that all of the life/safety systems are functioning before we open the facility.
 " Approximately 75 percent of the student recreation facility, soon to be named the France A. Córdova Recreational Sports Center, was to have been opened on Friday.
 The grand opening is scheduled for Oct. 12, when the dedication and naming ceremony will also occur. By that time the remainder of the fitness and multipurpose spaces, the multi-activity court, and the climbing wall will be complete.

 Short crop could complicate farmland leases, rent payments
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Low crop yields from this year's drought could mean an inability of some farmers to meet farmland rental agreements if they suffer major losses of income.
 The possibility means tenants and landlords need to communicate with one another, and both parties need to review the terms of lease agreements.
 "The ability to meet rent payments will vary widely among tenants due to the differing financial impacts of the 2012 drought," said Chris Hurt, Purdue Extension agricultural economist.
 Contributing factors include final crop yields, final grain prices, the amount of production that is forward-contracted, level of crop insurance coverage, if any, whether there is livestock involved, and a producer's financial strength heading into the 2012 drought.
 But regardless of financial circumstances, Purdue Extension agricultural economist Gerry Harrison said tenants and landlords are legally locked into lease agreements.
 "The law is clear on the duty to perform under a contract," he said. "A cropland lease, oral or written, is a contract." A tenant’s overall financial position will couple with the type of lease agreement to determine whether rent can be paid and what options tenants and landlords have.
 Common lease agreements include crop sharing, straight cash rent or a variation of the two. "If it is a crop share lease, the landowner is in a similar position to the tenant," Harrison said.
 "If the lease is a 'flex' lease, what is the flex provision? If the flex is based on crop yield, the lack of yield may remove any liability the tenant has, based on the flex provision.
 "If the flex lease is based on price for the crop, the tenant with a short crop may have a serious problem." Under Indiana law, a landlord can terminate a lease with 10 days' notice if a tenant doesn't pay rent when due, unless both parties agree otherwise or if the tenant pays the rent in full within the notice period.
 "At the very least, some flexibility in non-payment of rent by the due date might be needed this year until a crop insurance payment or a loan becomes available to the tenant," he said.
 Harrison has a free publication that provides an in-depth look at the legalities of farmland leases in Indiana. "Legal Aspects of Indiana Farmland Leases and Federal Tax Considerations" is available at

 Signature of long-sought particle that could revolutionize quantum computing seen by Purdue physicist
 Signature of long-sought particle that could revolutionize quantum computing seen by Purdue physicist WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A Purdue University physicist has observed evidence of long-sought Majorana fermions, special particles that could unleash the potential of fault-tolerant quantum computing.
 Leonid Rokhinson, an associate professor of physics, led a team that is the first to successfully demonstrate the fractional a.c.
 Josephson effect, which is a signature of the particles. "The search for this particle is for condensed-matter physicists what the Higgs boson search was for high-energy particle physicists," Rokhinson said.
 "It is a very peculiar object because it is a fermion yet it is its own antiparticle with zero mass and zero charge." The pursuit of Majorana fermions is driven by their potential to encode quantum information in a way that solves a problem dogging quantum computing.
 The current carriers of quantum bits, the basic unit of information in quantum computing, are delicate and easily destroyed by small disturbances from the local environment.
 Information stored through Majorana fermions could be protected from such perturbances, resulting in a much more resilient quantum bit and 'fault-tolerant' quantum computing, he said.
 "Information could be stored not in the individual particles, but in their relative configuration, so that if one particle is pushed a little by a local force, it doesn't matter," Rokhinson said.
 "As long as that local noise is not so strong that it alters the overall configuration of a group of particles, the information is retained.
 It offers an entirely new way of dealing with information." Majorana fermions also have the unique ability to retain a history of their interactions that can be used to encode quantum information, he said.
 "Other particles are interchangeable and if two electrons trade places, it is as if nothing had happened, but when you swap two Majorana fermions, it leaves a mark by altering their quantum mechanical state," Rokhinson said.
 "This change in state is like a passport book full of stamps and provides a record of exactly how the particle arrived at its current destination.
" Rokhinson observed a variation of the Josephson effect that is a unique signature of Majorana fermions. The effect describes the way an electrical current traveling between two superconductors oscillates at a frequency that depends on the applied voltage.
 The reverse also is true; an oscillating current generates specific voltage, proportional to the frequency. In the presence of Majorana fermions the frequency-voltage relationship should change by a factor of two in what is called the fractional a.c.
 Josephson effect, he said. Rokhinson used a one-dimensional semiconductor coupled to a superconductor to create a hybrid nanowire in which Majorana particles are predicted to form at the ends.
 When alternating current is applied through a set of two such wires, a specific voltage is generated across the device, which Rokhinson measured.
 As a magnetic field was applied and varied from weak to strong, the resulting steps in voltage became twice as tall, a signature of the formation of Majorana particles, he said.
 Victor Yakovenko, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland, was one of the first theorists to predict the fractional a.c.
 Josephson effect. The effect is very unusual and is specific to Majorana particles, which makes this observation more definitive than signatures obtained through other approaches, he said.
 "Majorana particles are the only particle that can produce this effect, and experimental observation of it is a tremendous breakthrough," Yakovenko said.
 "Of course, it will take time and independent confirmation to firmly establish it, but this is very exciting." The observation of this special state does not mean fault-tolerant quantum computing will happen any time soon, if at all, Yakovenko said.
 "Whether or not these particles will work for quantum computing has yet to be seen, but in the process of trying we will learn a lot of unknown quantum physics," he said.
 "This could open the door to a whole new field of the topological effects of quantum mechanics." A paper detailing the work will be published in the next issue of the journal 
Nature Physics and is currently available online. Co-authors include Xinyu Liu and Jacek Furdyna of the University of Notre Dame, who designed the material specifically for these experiments.
 Furdyna also has an honorary degree from Purdue. The work was partially supported by grants from the Army Research Office and the National Science Foundation.
 Rokhinson next plans to perform follow-up experiments and to modify the system to probe different properties of the observed state.
 The Fractional ac Josephson Effect in a Semiconductor-Superconductor Nanowire as a Signature of Majorana Particles Topological superconductors that support Majorana fermions have been predicted when one-dimensional semiconducting wires are coupled to a superconductor.
 Such excitations are expected to exhibit non-Abelian statistics and can be used to realize quantum gates that are topologically protected from local sources of decoherence.
 Here we report the observation of the fractional a.c. Josephson effect in a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor InSb/Nb nanowire junction, a hallmark of topological matter.
 When the junction is irradiated with a radio frequency f0 in the absence of an external magnetic field, quantized voltage steps (Shapiro steps) with a height &#8710;V=hf
0/2e are observed, as is expected for conventional superconductor junctions, where the supercurrent is carried by charge-2e Cooper pairs.
 At high magnetic fields the height of the first Shapiro step is doubled to hf0/e, suggesting that the supercurrent is carried by charge-e quasiparticles.
 This is a unique signature of the Majorana fermions, predicted almost 80 years ago.

 Skip Jackson Dog Jog brings canines to campus Sept. 22
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — The Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine's first Dr. Skip Jackson Dog Jog will be Sept. 22.
 "The new event combines the annual Skip Jackson Road Race, a fun run that was always held in conjunction with the College of Veterinary Medicine's annual fall conference for veterinarians and veterinary technicians, with the student-run Dog Jog," said Emily Rudman, a Purdue veterinary student in the class of 2014.
 "Since the entire fall conference will be held on the Purdue campus this year, we wanted to do an event that is open to the public and embraces the rich tradition and history of Purdue Veterinary Medicine.
" Horace "Skip" Jackson is professor emeritus of veterinary physiology and biochemistry, and until recently had run every year since the race's inception in 1972.
 Runners and dogs can still sign up to participate in the dog jog, which will begin at 8 a.m. at the college's "Continuum" sculpture at Lynn Hall on Harrison Street.
 The course is entirely on the Purdue campus. Onsite registration is 7-8 a.m. Sept. 22 at the entrance of Lynn Hall, 625 Harrison St.
 The price for the race is $20 for people, which includes a T-shirt, and $5 for each dog, which includes a bandana. All proceeds will go to PetSafe, a Purdue Veterinary Medicine program that provides veterinary care and housing for animals owned by families in crisis.
 The event is sponsored by McAfee Animal Hospital, a veterinary practice run by Purdue Veterinary Medicine graduate Larry McAfee of Valparaiso, Ind.

 Sliding metals show fluidlike behavior, new clues to wear
 This frame from a high-speed camera sequence reveals surprising behavior in a solid piece of metal sliding over another. The research is providing new insights into the mechanisms of wear and generation of machined surfaces that could help improve the durability of metal parts.
 (Purdue University School of Industrial Engineering image/N. Sundaram and Y. Guo)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Researchers have discovered a swirling, fluidlike behavior in a solid piece of metal sliding over another, providing new insights into the mechanisms of wear and generation of machined surfaces that could help improve the durability of metal parts.
 Studies using a microscope and high-speed camera revealed the formation of bumps, folds, vortexlike features and cracks on the metal surface.
 The findings were surprising because the experiment was conducted at room temperature and the sliding conditions did not generate enough heat to soften the metal.
 "We see phenomena normally associated with fluids, not solids," said Srinivasan Chandrasekar, a Purdue University professor of industrial engineering who is working with postdoctoral research associates Narayan Sundaram and Yang Guo.
 "It has been known that little pieces of metal peel off from sliding surfaces," Chandrasekar said. "The conventional view is that this requires many cycles of rubbing, but what we are saying is that when you have surface folding you don't need too many cycles for these cracks to form.
 This can happen very quickly, accelerating wear." Findings are detailed in a research paper published in the Sept. 7 issue of Physical Review Letters
. The magazine featured the research on the cover and also included a Viewpoint commentary about the work (http://physics.aps.org/articles/v5/100
). The researchers are developing models to further study the phenomena and understand the wide-ranging consequences of such fluidlike flow in metals, Chandrasekar said.
 The findings might also lead to improved surface quality in materials processing. The team observed what happens when a wedge-shaped piece of steel slides over a flat piece of copper.
 It was the first time researchers had directly imaged how sliding metals behave on the scale of 100 microns to 1 millimeter, known as the mesoscale.
 The observations show how tiny bumps form in front of the steel piece, followed by the swirling vortexlike movement and then the creation of shallow cracks.
 The folding and cracking were most pronounced when the steel piece was held at a sharp angle to the copper surface. The researchers hypothesize that the folding and cracking are due in part to a phenomenon similar to "necking," which happens as a piece of metal is stretched.
 Researchers used a specialized laboratory setup that included a high-speed camera and equipment that applies force to the sliding metals.
 The behavior was captured in movies that show the flow in color-coded layers just below the surface of the copper specimen. Copper is commonly used to model the mechanical behavior of metals.
 "Researchers have never had a good experimental setup to observe this kind of deformation directly," Guo said. "Our setup enables us to see the entire history of this fluidlike behavior as it occurs, whereas more conventional experiments rely on still images taken after the experiment is finished.
" Metals are made of groups of crystals called grains. Metal surfaces that have smaller grains may be less susceptible to the folding and crack formation.
 "We need to explore what role grain size plays," Chandrasekar said. "We think there should be some grain size below which this folding mechanism might be less active.
 We need to explore why - under what conditions - solid metals behave like fluids." Note to Journalists: A copy of the research paper is available by contacting Emil Venere, 765-494-4709, 
venere@purdue.edu Using in situ imaging, we report surface fold formation and fluidlike flow instabilities in sliding of annealed copper.
 We demonstrate using simulations that folding is principally driven by grain-induced plastic instability. The phenomenon shows remarkable similarities with Kelvin-Helmholtz-type flow instabilities in fluids.
 While such instabilities have been conjectured to exist in sliding interfaces at the nanoscale, we find vortices and folding in metals at the mesoscale.
 The occurrence of folds impacts many applications, including surface generation processes and tribology.

 SmartMoney ranks Purdue degree among nation's top 10 buys
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue University ranks eighth nationally in SmartMoney magazine's college "payback" survey, which quantifies the long-term value of a college education.
 In 2011 Purdue was ranked seventh. The magazine, which is produced by the Wall Street Journal, noted public universities again dominated the survey, holding the top 17 of the 50 slots.
 "This is more evidence that a Purdue degree pays off," said Victor Lechtenberg, acting provost and chief academic officer. "Purdue has great value because we offer an excellent education at a reasonable price.
 That attracts the top students." To rank the best buys, the magazine highlights the relationship between tuition costs and graduates' earning power.
 To determine each school's payback ratio, the magazine started with a list of 50 four-year institutions from three categories: Ivy League, private liberal arts and public.
 Data from a survey by PayScale.com, a consultant and online salary database, was used to look at median salaries alumni are earning at two career stages: recent graduates (an average of three years after graduation) and midcareer (an average of 15 years after graduation).
 The median salary for Purdue graduates two years after graduation was $51,800, with out-of-state degree costs of $66,538 (class of 2009).
 Purdue graduates' median salary 15 years after graduation was $87,200, with out-of-state degree costs of $39,168 (class of 1997), according to the data.
 The analysis of cost did not include financial aid or the in-state tuition rate. Tuition at Purdue for the 2012-13 academic year is $9,900 for in-state students and $28,702 for out-of-state students.
 The average SAT score for freshmen this fall is 1749 on the critical reading, math and writing sections. The University of Illinois, at No.
 5, was the only other Big Ten university in the top 10. The Georgia Institute of Technology was ranked first.

 Specialist: Controlling lawn weeds in drought carries risks
 Purdue University turf grass specialist Aaron Patton inspects a lawn that is partially green and partially brown, showing signs of drought stress.
 (Purdue Agricultural Communication photo/Tom Campbell) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - About the only thing green in many lawns these days is weeds.
 Should homeowners take action in the middle of a drought? It depends, a Purdue Extension turfgrass specialist says. With little to no rainfall in the forecast and temperatures well above 90 degrees, homeowners generally should avoid using herbicides, said Aaron Patton.
 In cases where lawns are holding up better to the heat and dryness, weed-killing products should be used carefully so as not to damage turf.
 Patton said there are a variety of weeds in drought-stricken lawns, including summer annual weeds such as crabgrass, common ragweed and marestail; biennial weeds such as wild carrot and bull thistle; and perennial weeds such as yellow nutsedge and Canada thistle.
 How those weeds are eradicated depends on the condition of the lawn, he said. For lawns that are not regularly watered and/or are brown, Patton said the condition of the lawn should determine whether herbicides are safe to use.
 "Herbicides are much less effective on drought-stressed weeds and can be damaging to drought-stressed turf, especially when temperatures are warm," he said.
 "My rule of thumb is that if the lawn has mild drought stress - more than 50 percent green - then herbicides can be applied. If the lawn is mostly brown, it is best to wait.
" If a lawn is brown and drought conditions persist, homeowners can pull weeds by hand, Patton said. They also can spot-mow areas where weeds are present, being careful not to mow those parts of the lawn without the unwanted vegetation.
 "For yellow nutsedge and summer annual weeds, it is better to hold off on applying herbicides until rain returns and the turf begins growing again," he said.
 "For perennial broadleaf weeds like dandelions, it might be best to wait until fall, as fall applications work better than spring and summer applications for broadleaf control.
" "The question I most typically get in an irrigated scenario or during a summer when turf is not drought-stressed is, 'Can I apply a herbicide when temperatures are 85 degrees or higher?
' First, you need to follow the herbicide label, as each herbicide acts differently." Applying herbicides when daily high temperatures soar above 85 degrees usually increases the risk of turf injury, Patton said.
 "Most herbicide labels do not prohibit applications at temperatures greater than 85 or 90 degrees, but they do caution against their use at these temperatures," he said.
 "A general recommendation is to make the application if the site is more weeds than turf and you are willing to assume the risk of injuring the turf.
" If an irrigated lawn is high-quality turf with only a few weeds, Patton recommends delaying herbicide applications until temperatures turn cooler.

 Specialist recommends weed control before planting winter wheat 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Proper weed management is important for the success of winter crops after the fall harvest, a Purdue Extension weed specialist says.
 While the drought has led to a harvest earlier than normal, that also means farmers can prepare fields for winter crops, such as wheat, earlier this year.
 "Farmers looking to plant wheat in the next couple of weeks, as long as the crops are off the field, are in good shape. Now's a good time to control weeds," Bill Johnson said.
 Recent rain has helped weeds thrive, and farmers will need to do additional work to prepare their fields for their winter crops.
 "The drought has made weed management very difficult, but as for this fall, we actually have pretty good soil moisture right now, and weeds are growing, so the weeds are fairly sensitive to herbicides," he said.
 Two herbicides safe to use before planting wheat are glyphosate and gramaxone. Johnson recommends farmers avoid 2,4-D and dicamba herbicides in the fall because they can lead to poor stand establishment and wheat head sterility in the spring.
 Starting with a clean field is key to weed management for winter wheat and other crops. A field without overgrowth of weeds is important for stand establishment.
 "If there's a dense infestation of weeds, you need to do something to control them, whether that's herbicides or tillage," Johnson said.
 Weeds prevalent this fall include dandelions and winter annuals such as henbit, chickweed and purple deadnettle; grasses such as annual bluegrass and Carolina foxtail; and areas that were planted to annual rye cover crops and where the annual rye either was not killed during the summer or all of the seed did not germinate in the spring.
 After planting wheat, farmers should scout their fields for weeds. Wheat needs to tiller well in the fall so there will be plenty of grain heads in the spring for production.

 Specialists: Drought creating feed shortages for Indiana dairies
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana dairy producers feel the pain of their corn- and soybean-farming brethren. The weekslong drought literally is drying up feed supplies in the field and leaving producers with some tough decisions, say two Purdue Extension dairy specialists.
 Producers need to act now to make sure they have access to alternative feed sources if dry conditions persist and they plan to continue operating their dairies at current herd size, said Tamilee Nennich and Mike Schutz.
 Some dairy producers might need to reduce herd sizes in order to survive, they said. "The drought is creating significant challenges for dairy farmers and their herds because dairy farmers depend on harvested forages to provide feed for their animals," Nennich said.
 "However, there are a number of strategies producers can consider to reduce the financial impacts of the drought." "Drought conditions often result in reduced pasture, hay and silage yields, which can greatly reduce the typical supply of forage for a dairy farm," Schutz said.
 "Being proactive on sourcing additional forage can be beneficial, as availability of forages may be reduced and prices will continue to rise as demand increases.
" Schutz said if forage is difficult to come by, producers might buy drought-stressed corn harvested as silage. Although it might not equal feed values of corn silage grown in a normal year, drought-stressed corn still can be a good source of feed.
 "The moisture of these crops must be monitored closely to be sure the crop will ensile and ferment correctly," Schutz said. "You'll also want to test them for nitrate levels.
" * Use non-forage fiber sources in dairy diets. "Although some effective fiber is necessary in a dairy cow's diet, non-fiber feed sources, such as soybean hulls, corn gluten feed, cottonseed hulls and wheat midds can help meet the animal's fiber requirements while still maintaining production and health," Nennich said.
 "Some less expensive effective fiber, such as straw or low-quality hay, may be added." * Properly harvest and store forage to reduce loss and waste.
 Pay attention to forage moisture levels, the use of inoculants, proper packing and rapid recovery of silages to ensure proper preservation.
 * Test forages for quality and to properly balance rations. Forage harvested in drought conditions might have much different nutrient qualities than forage harvested in a non-drought year.
 Nitrate levels also could be higher in drought-stressed forage. * Limit-feed dairy heifers or have them custom-raised. Limit-fed diets can include larger amounts of grain and byproduct feeds, thereby reducing the amount of forage needed to raise heifers.
 If heifers are custom-raised by a third party, producers can devote feed resources to rations for lactating cows. * Cull cows and heifers to stretch forage inventories and purchases.
 Make sure remaining animals are healthy and profitable while keeping in mind that replacement heifers could be in short supply and expensive later.
 "Under extreme situations, selling the herd may ultimately be the best option to avoid substantial loss of equity in the farm," Schutz said.
 "However, this decision needs to be made with the help of consultants, along with a thorough evaluation of the entire situation, to ensure that all options have been explored and discussed.
" Nennich and Schutz have written a series of papers on issues related to drought and dairy production. "Drought Strategies for Dairy Cattle," "Feeding Dairy Cattle During Drought Conditions," "Determining a Value for Corn Silage" and an accompanying corn silage value calculator, "Culling Dairy Cows: An Opportunity for Improvement When Feed Supplies Are Tight" and "Should I Quit Dairying Because of the Drought?
" are on the Animal Sciences Drought Information page at https://ag.purdue.edu/ansc/Pages/Drought.aspx. Additional information about the drought is available at the Purdue Extension drought website at 
http://www.purdue.edu/drought Indiana was home to about 1,550 dairy farms in 2011, employing nearly 8,800 people. Those dairies produced 3.54 billion pounds of milk - or 426 million gallons - worth more than $711 million in direct sales.
 Counting sales of culled cows and heifers, the state's dairy industry generated $1.45 billion in economic value.

 Specialists: Sell grain at harvest this fall; store only if necessary
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Economic trends and concerns over the condition of grain because of the drought suggest there's little incentive for farmers to store grain this fall.
 But those who do will need to quickly dry it down to a proper moisture content and watch for contamination, Purdue University specialists say.
 As farmers prepare to harvest a poorer-than-expected corn and soybean crop, they have to consider whether to hold onto their grain and hope for higher prices or sell it right out of the field.
 In most cases, farmers should skip storage and take their grain directly to the elevator, said Corinne Alexander, agricultural economist.
 "From an economics perspective, in short crop years one of the things we tend to see is that prices peak early, either before or during harvest, and then decline through the remainder of the marketing year," Alexander said.
 "The market is giving a strong signal to farmers to deliver early and at harvest because storage will not be profitable. This is true for both corn and soybeans.
" Markets reacted strongly to a pair of Aug. 10 U.S. Department of Agriculture reports. One report estimated a 2012 national corn crop of just 10.8 billion bushels and a soybean crop of only 2.69 billion bushels, down 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively, from 2011.
 Another report projected lower world grain supplies for the 2012 marketing year. That news, along with a continued decline in crop condition as a summer-long drought dragged on, sent prices for corn and soybeans soaring.
 In recent weeks corn has eclipsed $8 a bushel while soybeans have shot past $16 a bushel. Farmers considering waiting out the market for even higher prices could be leaving money on the table if they put their grain in a bin, Alexander said.
 Prices are likely to come down in the first quarter of 2013 as South American farmers harvest their corn and soybeans and provide some relief for stressed world stocks.
 "Those would include livestock producers who are supplying their own feed or producers who have contracts with either food or ethanol processors where the contract specifies a later delivery date," she said.
 Storing grain could present a host of challenges this fall, including drydown methods, mold, leftover fine material in bins and insects, said Richard Stroshine, a grain quality specialist.
 Grain could be going into bins at higher moisture levels and temperatures because many farmers planted early and could be harvesting later this month or in September when temperatures are hotter than in the typical harvest months of October and November, Stroshine said.
 Unless farmers work fast to get grain dried down to appropriate levels, their crop could spoil in the bin. If grain is placed in a bin dry it needs to be cooled using aeration, taking advantage of cooler nighttime temperatures, Stroshine said.
 "Mold will grow at 15 percent moisture if the corn is fairly warm - say, 80 degrees or so," Stroshine said. "It's very slow, but there still can be mold growth there that could eventually compromise your ability to store the corn.
" For early harvested corn, Stroshine recommends a stored moisture content of 14.5 percent, or 13 percent if the grain will be stored through next summer.
 To get corn down to those lower moisture levels rapidly, farmers should use high-temperature cross flow drying. Farmers who need to dry in the bin can increase the drying rate using a technique called layer drying, Stroshine said.
 Like the name implies, a farmer will place grain in the bin in layers while continuously drying. "That first layer will dry faster than normal, and by the time you put your second layer in the bin you will have gotten some field drydown of that grain, which should save some in-bin drying time," he said.
 "Another thing to remember is if you don't remove the fine material from the bin before you put grain into it you'll need to core your bin.
 Fine material tends to concentrate in the center of the bin. To core the bin, open the center well, pull out a load and you should get a lot of those fines out.
 If your grain is peaked you also should level the top surface, which is very important for good aeration." * Crop insurance. Crop losses incurred in the field are covered by insurance but post-harvest crop losses are not.
 * Grain breakage. "Dry kernels and kernels that have been invaded by fungi in the field will break up more easily, so you'll need to set your combine at the lowest cylinder speed you can to get a decent removal of kernels from the cobs," Stroshine said.
 "You'll also probably have a lot of foreign material with those kernels - pieces of stalk and cob - that could cause some problems.
 You might need some kind of cleaning equipment to help you out because I don't think the combine will be able to do it alone." * Aspergillus ear rot.
 The hot and dry summer has provided a good environment for the development of this fungus in corn. The fungus produces aflatoxin, a carcinogen that can be harmful or fatal to livestock fed the infected corn.
 Grain testing can identify infected kernels. Removing fine material and small kernels from the harvested grain can reduce the levels of mycotoxins but not eliminate them altogether.
 * Insects. Higher populations of grain-damaging bugs are expected this year with the warmer temperatures and the availability of broken kernels and fine material as food.
 Insect problems have been reported in grain already in storage. Additional grain storage tips are available on the Purdue Post Harvest Grain Quality website at

 Spensa Technologies expands staff, announces two new leadership positions
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – An agriscience company that develops and markets new agricultural technologies announces the hiring of two new vice presidents who bring a combined 65 years of experience in agribusiness and product development.
 Spensa Technologies Inc., a Purdue Research Park-based company, has hired Kim Nicholson as vice president of business development and Tom Puterbaugh as vice president of products.
 Nicholson has more than 25 years of experience in the agribusiness sector in senior sales and marketing roles for such industry suppliers as American Cyanamid and BASF.
 She earned a bachelor's degree in agronomy from Purdue University. Puterbaugh has more than 30 years of experience in managing new product introductions across multiple markets worldwide for Caterpillar Inc.
 He has a bachelor's degree in management from Purdue and an MBA from Indiana Wesleyan University. "Kim brings an understanding of the target market dynamics and important experience in successfully bringing technologies and products to the market," said Johnny Park, president of Spensa Technologies and a Purdue research assistant professor in electrical and computer engineering.
 "Tom brings an ability to help lead teams in the planning, organizing and executing of new products from concept to production. He also brings a strong focus on understanding to meet and exceed customer needs.
 "We feel fortunate to have them join our team, especially as we prepare to launch new products in the agricultural market." Earlier this year, Spensa launched MyTraps.com, an online data application, that helps growers and pesticide consultants electronically track the number of insects in their crop fields so they can better control crop damage caused by insects and improve the use of insecticides.
 Spensa also is commercializing the Z-Trap, which is an insect trapping device that automatically detects the number of target insects captured by the trap and sends the data wirelessly to the grower's mobile phone or computer.
 The technology is being used to collect data on codling moths, Oriental fruit moths and leaf rollers in apple orchards, but will eventually be used to collect insect data from other types of crops.
 Park said that Spensa is in pre-production of 75 Z-Traps and will carry out large-scale field experiments and evaluations during the 2012 growing season with an expected launch of the Z-Trap in 2013.
 Spensa Technologies is a startup housed in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette. The company was founded in 2009 by Johnny Park, president and CEO.
 Spensa's mission is to design, develop and deliver novel technologies for the agricultural industry that will reduce reliance on manual labor, foster eco-friendly farming and enhance crop production efficiency.
 Their technologies leverage the team's world-leading expertise in wireless sensor networks, robotics and computer vision. The Purdue Research Park has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country in four locations across Indiana.
 The parks are home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Merrillville, Indianapolis and New Albany.

 Spider mites begin to inhabit drought-stressed soybean fields
 Two-spotted spider mites are infesting drought-stressed soybeans in Indiana. When left untreated, mites can cause severe and irreversible foliar damage to soybean plants.
 (Purdue Department of Entomology photo/John Obermeyer)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Very dry conditions are encouraging two-spotted spider mites to lay claim to drought-stressed soybean plants throughout the much of the eastern Corn Belt.
 When left untreated, spider mites can cause extensive and irreversible damage to soybean foliage, so growers need to keep an eye on their fields - especially if the weather remains dry.
 "Mites are found in every field, every year, and usually do nothing of consequence to producers" said Christian Krupke, Purdue Extension entomologist.
 "However, stressed plants actually provide a more nutritious feast for spider mites than healthy plants do." Amino acids are more available to insects when they feed on stressed soybeans instead of healthy soybeans, he said.
 That means the mites can use these nutrients to synthesize proteins for use in reproduction. "Under conditions where drought-stressed plants are abundant, mites thrive and quickly colonize large areas or fields where stress is more evident," Krupke said.
 Spider mite damage is typically most visible at first in the most stressed areas of the field; this often includes field edges. Soybean growers are likely to first notice foliar damage in the form of subtle stippling of leaves, which can progress to bronzing.
 If dry weather persists and mites are left unchecked and untreated, necrosis, or tissue death, can occur. Once foliage is bronze, the damage is done and cannot be reversed, even with treatment, Krupke said.
 But before growers consider treatment, he said, they need to be sure crop damage is a result of spider mite feeding and not one of the many other diseases, pathogens or nutrient deficiencies that can cause similar foliage appearances.
 "To confirm the presence of mites, shake some discolored soybean leaves over a white piece of paper," Krupke said. "Watch for small, dark specks moving about on the paper.
 Also, look for very tiny, fine webbing on the undersides of the discolored leaves. "Once spider mites have been positively identified in the damaged areas of the field, it is essential that portions of the entire field be scouted to determine the limits and range of infestation.
" According to Krupke, spider mites colonize fields in a patchy fashion that often begins at field borders. He suggested sampling at least five areas of a field to determine how far mites might have moved into the field.
 If mites are positively identified in drought-stressed soybean fields, Krupke said, pesticide application is typically warranted, and it sometimes takes more than one insecticide or miticide treatment.
 "Surviving spider mites are able to repopulate a field much more quickly than their natural predators, which are usually also wiped out by these chemical applications," he said.
 "Obviously, the best plant stress reliever under dry conditions is rain," he said. "Significant rain doesn't control spider mites but helps the soybean plant become more vigorous and healthy.
 This, in turn, makes the 'juices' of the plant less nutritious to the mites, and makes mites less likely to reproduce as quickly.
 "We can't make it rain, but we can take steps to make sure that mite scouting and treatment is prioritized until conditions improve.
 Mites don't need to reach outbreak levels, but vigilance is important in early stages of infestation."

 State Fair is showtime for Purdue College of Veterinary Medicine
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Cats and dogs will help give lessons in animal health, including the benefits of spaying and neutering, during the Indiana 
State Fair. For the 28th year, the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine is working with the Indiana Veterinary Medical Association to demonstrate surgical procedures daily during the fair, which runs Friday (Aug.
 3) through Aug. 19 in Indianapolis. The surgeries will be in a new location this year, the Ag/Hort Pavilion. The spaying and neutering surgeries are done in a glass-enclosed operating room that allows fairgoers to watch from seats outside.
 Overhead cameras in the room feed outside monitors that give observers an up-close view. Surgeries will be done at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
 each day except Aug. 8, 13 and 15. On the fair's Purdue Day, Aug. 10, Purdue veterinarian Lyn Freeman will perform laparoscopic spaying, a minimally invasive surgery that involves three small punctures rather than an incision.
 A tiny camera is utilized to enable the surgeon to see inside and remove the ovaries with a special surgical instrument. IVMA veterinarians will do most of the surgeries.
 Assisting at each surgery will be a senior veterinary student and an anesthesia technician from Purdue, and a surgery technician from either Purdue or IVMA.
 A veterinarian or veterinary technician from either IVMA or Purdue will be stationed outside to provide details on what's happening and answer questions.
 The cats and dogs being spayed and neutered will come from the Humane Society of Indianapolis. The animals have been adopted but must be spayed or neutered before they are released from the shelter.
 On the Aug. 10 Purdue Day, the College of Veterinary Medicine will host an 11:30 a.m. special demonstration on the Purdue Main Stage by Jonathan Townsend, assistant professor of dairy production medicine.
 The demonstration will involve a cow and is designed to complement the state fair theme of "The Year of Dairy Cow." Source: Kevin Doerr, director of alumni relations and public affairs for the College of Veterinary Medicine, 765-494-8216, 765-414-0028,

 State regulators getting word out about new fertilizer rules 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The Office of Indiana State Chemist is in a yearlong effort to inform farmers and fertilizer dealers and applicators of new rules regulating how manure and other fertilizers can be staged on farms and applied to fields.
 The rules, designed to keep fertilizers out of waterways and wells, were drafted by the Purdue-based OISC and approved by Gov. Mitch Daniels in February.
 They take effect Feb. 16, 2013, giving farmers, dealers and applicators one year to comply with them. The state Legislature assigned the OISC the task of crafting the rules.
 The office has posted the rules and a related document of frequently asked questions on its website (http://www.isco.purdue.edu).
 It also will inform licensed fertilizer dealers as well as private and commercial applicators of the rules by mail. It is possible that some fertilizer dealers and applicators in rare instances still might not know about the new rules by the time they take effect, said Matt Pearson, administrator of the office's fertilizer section.
 He said the office would take that into consideration on a case basis should a problem arise. "We’ll have to because no matter what we do to get the word out about the rules, some people might still not know about them," he said.
 "We want to be understanding and work with them as they apply these new rules to their operations." Workshops throughout the state under the Pesticide Recertification Application Program will involve educating applicators about the new rules.
 In addition, the OISC intends to keep environmental groups informed of how the rules are being implemented. The requirements specify how fertilizer can be safely stored on farms until its use - called staging - and how far from waterways and wells it can be applied and under what conditions, such as weather.
 They complement Indiana Department of Environmental Management regulations, Pearson said. The rules were developed by a committee composed of representatives of the OISC, the livestock industry, farmers, members of the Fertilizer Advisory Board, Purdue University faculty and IDEM.

 Steps suggested for Purdue Alert notification
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - In conjunction with National Safety Day, Sept. 26, Purdue officials are suggesting a way to supplement the current Purdue Alert system.
 "The Purdue Alert text messages are sent from two different phone numbers - 67283 and 226787," says Carol Shelby, senior director of environmental health and public safety.
 "We suggest that you add these two numbers to the contact list in your phone and label the contact "Purdue Alert." That way, when you receive the alert messages, you'll know immediately that it's sent to you by our Purdue police.
" More than 50,000 students and faculty are registered to receive Purdue Alert texts. Purdue has partnered with Rave Mobile Safety for sending text message alerts.
 Other components for Purdue Alert - activated on a case-by-case basis- include sirens, campus-wide emailing, Purdue home page, and Boiler TV.
 To register for the text messages go to http://www.purdue.edu/securepurdue, click on "Change My Emergency Contact Number," enter your Purdue career account login and password, enter your cell phone number, and click "Save.
" It is suggested that Verizon Wireless subscribers update the network information in their cell phones quarterly to help ensure they will receive the text messages.
 To do so, call *228 ("star" 228) and select option 2, "Update Roaming Capabilities." No action is necessary for other wireless carriers.

 Students in Krannert program get real-world experience
 Students in the Krannert School of Management Experiential Learning Institute program present results of a project for Sealy Inc.
 to company executives. The team looked at marketing for a new product. The students are (from left) Jeffrey Marker, Karan Ahuja, Jacob Nielson and Anthony Fisher.
 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons) Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Eight teams of Purdue University students have just wrapped up consulting projects that have given them real-world experience putting to use what they've learned in classrooms.
 The teams have taken part in Krannert School of Management's Experiential Learning Institute (ELI). They have advised companies that are local, from throughout the United States and from overseas that needed outside help with various projects.
 "ELI began in the fall of 2009 as a way to offer Krannert MBA students the opportunity to apply what they had learned in the classroom in an active business setting," said Matthew Lynall, a clinical associate professor of management and ELI director.
 "We are moving to make ELI accessible to Krannert undergraduates and to students from throughout the university," he said. "As the program has developed, we have undertaken projects in conjunction with other Purdue colleges and schools, including engineering, agriculture, pharmacy, communication and aviation technology.
 "We also do projects in Europe where the students spend half the semester at GISMA Business School, our partner school in Germany, and the other half in West Lafayette.
" Client companies get the benefit of bright and enthusiastic students solving critical business problems. The companies also are helping develop a new generation of business leaders while identifying potential employees.
 Participating companies pay expenses incurred by the school and the teams. Each team has four to five students. They get four credit hours for the full-semester course and spend 10-15 hours a week on the project.
 "The companies typically have some affiliation with Purdue, perhaps through alumni connections or recruiting on campus," Lynall said.
 "We have a growing number of repeat clients. Also, graduates who have done an ELI project often are keen to help develop projects at their new employers.
 And then some companies hear about the program and approach us out of the blue." Among past clients have been Southwest Airlines, Caribou Coffee, Allison Transmission, Ingersoll Rand, Sears, Caterpillar and Indiana University Health.
 This semester's teams have completed projects for Sara Lee Corp., Downers Grove, Ill.; Sealy Inc., Trinity, N.C.; Sennheiser Electronic GmbH & Co, Hanover, Germany; Harting Technology Group, Espelkamp, Germany; Stratosphere Quality, Fishers, Ind.; Evonik Industries, which acquired Eli Lilly's Lafayette plant; Orchard of Golf, West Lafayette; and Kyk Energy, a company formed by two Purdue undergraduates.
 "Beyond the credit hours, ELI students get valuable experience, great references and can sometimes end up with a job offer from their client organization," Lynall said.
 Ben Crockett is a case in point. In the fall of 2010, Crockett, a Krannert MBA student, began working with four other students on a project for Dow AgroSciences at its world headquarters in Indianapolis.
 The team, which included a student from Colombia and a student from China, looked at how the company's forage sales representatives were approaching clients, who are mostly dairy farmers.
 "You apply what you've learned and put into practice theories from your classes. It's real business, real problems," he said. Crockett's team finished up last spring at the same time he completed his MBA.
 He has been working for Dow AgroSciences since then in productivity and strategy acceleration, utilizing Six Sigma methodology, and recently was promoted into a global supply chain role.
 Crockett is from Idaho and earned his bachelor's degree at Brigham Young University in Utah. He chose Purdue for his MBA because of its strong reputation in strategy and supply chain management.
 He had not planned on staying in Indiana until the ELI project led to the Dow AgroSciences job offer. Now he and his family are happy to be settled in Indianapolis.
 Brian Fife, global strategy implementation leader for Dow AgroSciences, is a Purdue graduate who initiated the company's relationship with ELI.
 He said the work has had three benefits for Dow AgroSciences. The company benefits from good, quality projects and opportunities to evaluate potential talent while strengthening its relationship with Purdue.
 "We have a positive and strong collaboration with Dr. Lynall," he said. "That has helped us, for instance, in expanding the project team into the College of Agriculture.
 The whole partnership is a win/win situation. We get access to knowledge, and the students get real-world work experience, get to know our business and have the opportunity to show us what they can do.
" After starting his job, Crockett was assigned to be the Dow AgroSciences liaison with the next Krannert team working on a project.
 A member of that team, Anthony Fisher, has just been hired, and Fife said Fisher will be the liaison for Dow AgroSciences' next ELI project, which will be submitted in the fall.
 The success of the ELI projects with Dow AgroSciences is just the outcome Lynall wants for the program. "We want to help students turn their expertise into experience and their skills into career success," he said.

 Students prefer apps to the Web when using smartphones
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Students prefer using apps on their smartphones instead of being pointed to mobile app sites, according to a survey of Purdue University students.
 This runs counter to a move toward mobile Web development using HTML 5 by many Web developers. The study results are being published Tuesday (Sept.
 25) at the online academic site Educause Center for Applied Research. The study had 1,566 respondents and a margin of error of 3.3 percent.
 At issue is whether when looking for information - such as wanting to check the weather forecast - students go to a weather app or simply use their phone's browser to connect with a weather website.
 The survey results were clear: Students want the app. For almost every type of use surveyed, students prefer to use an app they have installed on their phones (the lone exception was for reference information).
 Using the weather example, students had a preference for the app by 85 percent versus 8 percent who wanted to use the Web. The Purdue students said native apps are faster and simpler to navigate, perceptions that are also true, says Kyle Bowen director of Information Technology at Purdue's informatics group and one of the paper's co-authors.
 "They are easier and faster to use, but native app programming is new and unfamiliar to most Web developers," Bowen says. "And trying to cut corners in developing an app, such as by using a template tool, doesn't help you in the long run.
" This isn't welcome news for Web developers, who are part of a national trend toward favoring HTML-5 built mobile websites over apps.
 For example, a 2011 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education was headlined, "As mobile devices multiply, some colleges turn away from building campus apps
." But it's not just universities that are learning this lesson. At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September, Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook's 
biggest mistake so far was betting on the HTML-5 mobile Web instead of focusing on native apps. Purdue has developed seven mobile classroom apps designed to raise student performance through its 
Purdue Studio project. Bowen, who leads the project, says although he would prefer to develop mobile websites, the project team learned early on that students weren't comfortable with them.
 "The first version of our Hotseat app had a mobile Web interface. There was no native app," Bowen says. "We discovered that students would go the app store and look for the Hotseat app, and when it wasn't there they wouldn't use the software on their phone.
" Matthew Pistilli, a co-author on the paper and an academic technologies research scientist at Purdue, says this information into use preferences is important because there is little doubt that mobile devices are the future for higher education.
 "The advantage of using mobile devices in higher education is that it allows the student to take the classroom almost anywhere," Pistilli says.
 "For example, using an app such as Purdue's Jetpack or through mobile access to Blackboard, students can read articles, work on assignments or collaborate with others from anywhere.
" Pistilli says there are hidden benefits, too, because instructors and administrators can learn more about which educational approaches are working through data produced by the apps.
 "Analytics collected on application use allow an instructor or institution to do several things, such as fine tune the software, promote the use of other apps or simply provide information to students about how they can enhance their class performance," Pistilli says.
 * When asked how to rank their skill level on using the phone from novice (only using the phone for calls, email and texting) to expert (having developed mobile apps), 85 percent considered themselves either an intermediate (42 percent) or advanced (43 percent) user.
 * Students rely on their devices: Users describing themselves as novice used their device an average of 2.1 hours per day, and expert users are on their device 5.3 hours per day.
 * The most popular operating systems were Android, used by 43 percent of the students, and Apple's iOS, which was used by 40 percent.
 "There are a number of manufacturers building many different Android smartphones, so Apple's iPhone is the clear favorite device among our students," Bowen says.
 * The least popular device was the RIM Blackberry, which was used by 9 percent of the respondents. * Students are aware of data charges, and 33 percent say they would never download a video unless connected to a Wi-Fi network.
 In the debate over "native versus neutral" what do students prefer? Is a student's preference for a mobile learning application related to the nature of the information provided or the activity performed?
 This research bulletin examines a study conducted by Purdue University regarding student mobile preferences. This study provides insights into how students prefer to consume information on the mobile devices ranging broad categories to coursework-specific areas of interest.
 Additionally, a brief case study of Purdue's own mobile development activities illustrates one example for how this information can be practically applied.
 The information detailed in this research bulletin is intended to help inform future mobile application development efforts, as well as establish expectations for companies with which institutions do business.

 Students to design, build experiment to fly on space station
 Purdue graduate student Samantha Alberts and professor Steven Collicott discuss details of a zero-gravity flight experiment that flew this June on NASA's "vomit comet," an airplane that induces short periods of weightlessness by flying in steep parabolic maneuvers.
 NASA has selected a team of students from Purdue and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State universities to design and build an experiment to be operated on the International Space Station.
 The space station experiment, which will be designed to study the physics of how fluids change shape inside tubes in weightlessness, will be far smaller than the vomit comet hardware.
 (Purdue University photo/Andrew Hancock)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – NASA has selected a team of students from Purdue and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State universities to design and build an experiment to be operated on the International Space Station.
The universities were chosen by NASA to create an original experiment in "capillary fluid dynamics" through the space agency's National Lab Education Projects for the International Space Station.
"This project will give students unique and in-depth, real-world, team-based, original, design-build-test educational experiences that will accelerate their learning and their careers," said 
Steven Collicott, the Purdue professor of aeronautics and astronautics whose students will complete the project while taking his course on zero-gravity flight experiments.
He is leading the project with John Kizito, a professor of mechanical engineering at N.C. A&T. "The collaboration will expose our students - the next generation of explorers - to microgravity science and technology," Kizito said.
The experiment is part of overall work to provide data that could help in the design of systems that require the precise control of fluids and gases, such as life-support equipment and fuel tanks for spacecraft.
 Students will study the physics of how fluids change shape inside tubes in weightlessness. Findings also could apply to technologies for use on Earth such as fuel cells, medical instruments and miniature diagnostic devices.
 Primarily undergraduate engineering students at both universities will design and build the shoebox-size experiment, develop the procedures for operation in space, train the astronauts, process the data, and write research papers describing the results.
"We anticipate the experiment becoming operational in orbit in 2014 or 2015," said Collicott, who has designed previous experiments operated on the space station and also using suborbital rockets and drop towers.
 "Collaborating with Dr. Kizito to lead our students in the development of an orbital experiment is an exciting step for me. His NASA experiences and his teaching and research make this a good pairing.
"The project includes efforts to inspire middle school students to pursue and enjoy topics in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, fields.
"We envision curriculum development that teaches basic STEM concepts based on the topic of the experiment," Collicott said. "A great thing about the experiment topic is that we can design desktop demonstrations that middle school teachers and students everywhere can replicate and learn from in a hands-on manner.
"The effort also will include contributions from Portland State University. Other team members are professors Mark Weislogel of Portland State and Todd Kelley from Purdue, and consultant Emily CoBabe-Ammann.
About 20 Purdue undergraduate students will be involved in the project each semester over approximately three years; 10 N.C. A&T.
 students per semester will be directly involved and about 20 fluid mechanics students per semester will do coursework related to project.
Purdue graduate student Samantha Alberts may take a leading role in the project. She participated in a NASA-funded project that had similar goals while she was an undergraduate at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis.
"That project provided invaluable research experience and directly influenced my decision to pursue graduate school at Purdue," she said.
 A team of students taking the same zero-gravity flight experiments course at Purdue last semester flew an experiment in June on NASA's "vomit comet," an airplane that induces short periods of weightlessness by flying in steep parabolic maneuvers.
 The experiment was designed to study the physics of how fluids change shape inside tubes in weightlessness.Since 1996, students taking Collicott's class have operated about 30 zero-gravity experiments on aircraft, and five experiments for suborbital rocket flights have been completed or are under way.

 Study: Children abused by parents face increased cancer risk
 New Purdue research shows that frequent child abuse by a parent can increase a child's cancer risk in adulthood, and the effects are especially significant when mothers abuse their daughters and fathers abuse their sons.
 The research was conducted by Kenneth Ferraro, distinguished professor of sociology and director of Purdue's Center on Aging and the Life Course, and sociology and gerontology graduate student Patricia Morton.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Frequent abuse by a parent can increase a child's cancer risk in adulthood, and the effects are especially significant when mothers abuse their daughters and fathers abuse their sons, according to new research from Purdue University.
 "People often say that children are resilient and they'll bounce back, but we found that there are events that can have long-term consequences on adult health," said 
Kenneth Ferraro, distinguished professor of sociology and director of Purdue's Center on Aging and the Life Course. "In this case, people who were frequently emotionally or physically abused by their parents were more likely to have cancer in adulthood, and the link was greater when fathers abused sons and mothers abused daughters.
 Overall, the more frequent and intense the abuse, the more it elevated the cancer risk. "We would like to see child abuse noted as an environmental factor that can increase cancer occurrence in adulthood.
 More research on this topic also could help mediate the effects or improve interventions to help abused children." The research, which was conducted with sociology and gerontology graduate student Patricia Morton, was funded by the National Institute on Aging and is published online by the 
Journal of Aging and Health. "We started examining a variety of childhood misfortunes, including abuse, and when these were all combined, we found that men with the most stressors during childhood were more likely to develop cancer," Morton said.
 "Second, we found that when children were abused by their same-sex parent, it increased their cancer risk." The researchers can't say exactly why that is, but a possible reason is the effect of the greater social bond between same-sex children and parents.
 "Other studies have shown that if a mother smokes, the daughter is more likely to smoke, and the same relationship is found when sons mirror their father's behavior," Morton said.
 "More research is needed, but another possibility is that men may be more likely to physically abuse their sons, and mothers are more likely to physically abuse their daughters.
" The study's findings were based on survey data from 2,101 adults in two waves of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States.
 Abuse was one of many childhood misfortunes - including poverty, loss of parent and family educational status - that researchers examined to determine if there was a link to cancer in adulthood.
 In the first analysis, the research team found that men who experienced the most cumulative stressors during childhood were more likely to have cancer.
 This was not true with women, and this suggests that men and women may have different responses to childhood stressors, Morton said.
 The second analysis looked at each category of misfortune, and this is where the connection between abuse and cancer was revealed.
 Survey participants were not directly asked if they were abused, but abuse was defined by survey answers to questions such as how frequently a parent, sibling or other person insulted or swore at them as a child; refused to talk them; threatened to hit them; pushed, grabbed or shoved; threw something at them; kicked, bit or hit them with a fist; choked them; or burned or scalded them.
 The frequency of these abuses also was identified. The link was still there when controlled for the adults' age, lifestyle choices and economic status, but the researchers would like to look closer at these mechanisms.
 "It also is likely," Ferraro said, "that the effect between child abuse and cancer is underrepresented in our study, because people who suffered abuse and were then incarcerated, placed in a mental institution or died were not included in this survey of adults.
 These groups may represent people with more acute and severe effects from abuse, and even though they are omitted, we still find a link.
" The researchers are now examining potential links between child abuse and other health outcomes, including heart attacks and types of cancer.
 "The connection between negative childhood events and mental health is accepted, and these findings reinforce that such events can also have a long-lasting effect on a person's physical health," Morton said.
 "It's shocking just how much the damage sticks, and it is a reminder that childhood, which is defined by rapidly changing biological systems, is a sensitive period of development.
" In addition to Morton and Ferraro, Markus Schafer, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Toronto and former Purdue graduate student, also participated on the research team.
 The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States is sponsored by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Network on Successful Midlife Development.

apatterson@purdue.edu Objective: To address the inconsistent findings on whether childhood misfortune increases adult cancer occurrence.
 Methods: This study uses longitudinal data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) that first sampled 3,032 respondents aged 25 to 74 during 1995-1996.
 A series of logistic regressions were estimated separately for men and women to test whether the effect of childhood misfortune on adult cancer was largely cumulative or specific to the type or profile of misfortune.
 Results: For men, additive childhood misfortune, physical abuse by father, and frequent abuse by either parent increased cancer risk.
 For women, physical abuse by mother and frequent abuse by either parent increased cancer risk. Discussion: Analyses reveal the importance of examining alternative specifications of childhood misfortune for men and women.
 Additive childhood misfortune predicted cancer for men only, whereas child abuse by parent of the same sex predicted cancer for men and women.

 Study: Hearing impaired ears hear differently in noisy environments
 Kenneth S. Henry (from left), a postdoctoral researcher, and Michael G. Heinz, an associate professor, of Purdue's Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences found that background noise causes the ears of those with hearing impairments to work differently.
 The findings are published as a Brief Communication in Nature Neuroscience. (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons)Download Photo 
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The world continues to be a noisy place, and Purdue University researchers have found that all that background chatter causes the ears of those with hearing impairments to work differently.
 "When immersed in the noise, the neurons of the inner ear must work harder because they are spread too thin," said Kenneth S. Henry, a postdoctoral researcher in Purdue's Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences.
 "It's comparable to turning on a dozen television screens and asking someone to focus on one program. The result can be fuzzy because these neurons get distracted by other information.
" The findings, by Henry and Michael G. Heinz, an associate professor of speech, language and hearing sciences, are published as a Brief Communication in 
Nature Neuroscience. The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.
 "Previous studies on how the inner ear processes sound have failed to find connections between hearing impairment and degraded temporal coding in auditory nerve fibers, which transmit messages from the inner ear to the brain," said Heinz, who studies auditory neuroscience.
 "The difference is that such earlier studies were done in quiet environments, but when the same tests are conducted in a noisy environment, there is a physical difference in how auditory nerve fibers respond to sound.
" Hearing loss, suffered in varying degrees by 36 million American adults, means there is damage to sensory cells in the cochlea and to cochlear neurons as well.
 The cochlea is the part of the inner ear that transforms sound into electrical messages to the brain. In this study, the researchers measured a variety of physiological markers in chinchillas, some with normal hearing and others with a cochlear hearing loss, as they listened to tones in quiet and noisy environments.
 Chinchillas are used because they have a similar hearing range to humans, and background noise is used in the study to simulate what people would hear in a crowded room.
 "The study confirmed that there is essentially no change, even for those with hearing loss, in terms of how the cochlear neurons are processing the tones in quiet, but once noise was added, we did observe a diminished coding of the temporal structure," Henry said.
 The researchers focused on coding of the temporal fine structure of sound, which involves synchrony of neural discharges to relatively fast fluctuations in sound pressure.
 Both coding of fast fine structure information and coding of slower envelope fluctuations are critical to perception of speech in everyday listening environments.
 "When noise was part of the study, there was a reduction in how synchronized the neurons were with the temporal fine structure," Henry said.
 The auditory system filters sound into a number of channels that are tuned to different frequencies, and those channels vary based on their frequency tuning.
 In a normal system, the channels are sharp and focused, but they get broader and more scattered with hearing impairment. "Now that we know a major physiological effect from hearing loss is that the auditory nerve fibers are particularly distracted by background noise, this has implications for research and clinical settings," said Heinz, who also has a joint appointment in biomedical engineering.
 "For example, most audiology testing, whether it is lab research or hearing-loss screenings, takes place in a quiet environment, but testing noisy, more realistic backgrounds is necessary to truly understand how the ear is processing sound.
 This also could influence the design of hearing aids and assistive technologies. "Designers are often working on improving the temporal coding of the signal, but this research suggests that a primary focus should be on improving noise-reduction algorithms so the hearing aid provides a clean signal to the auditory nerve.
 Other ways people can reduce background noise include induction-loop hearing systems, which are used in churches and other public settings to provide a cleaner signal by avoiding room noise.
" Next, the researchers plan to expand the study to focus on more real-world noises and coding of slower envelope information in sound.
 "Additional study is certainly needed, and there are others who are also looking at the role the central nervous system plays, too," Henry said.
 "But ultimately, we found that hearing loss degrades temporal coding of sounds in background noise in the cochlea, the most peripheral level of auditory processing.
" Note to Journalists: Journalists interested in a copy of the journal article can contact Amy Patterson Neubert, Purdue News Service, at 765-494-9723, 
apatterson@purdue.edu. ABSTRACT Behavioral studies in humans suggest that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) decreases sensitivity to the temporal structure of sound, but neurophysiological studies in mammals provide little evidence for diminished temporal coding.
 We found that SNHL in chinchillas degraded peripheral temporal coding in background noise substantially more than in quiet. These results resolve discrepancies between previous studies and help to explain why perceptual difficulties in hearing-impaired listeners often emerge in noisy situations.

 Study: Moms can be stressed when certain children care for them
 Research by Megan Gilligan, from left, a Purdue doctoral student, and Jill Suitor, a professor of sociology, found that older mothers are more likely to be stressed when they receive help from an adult child who is not their preferred caretaker.
 (Purdue University photo/Andrew Hancock)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Older mothers are more likely to be stressed when they receive help from an adult child who is not their preferred caretaker, according to new research from Purdue University.
 "Most mothers have a preference for which child they turn to in a crisis, confide in and prefer as their future caregivers," said Jill Suitor, a professor of sociology.
 "And when mothers received care from the adult child who was not their first choice, they reported more depressive symptoms, such as sadness, loneliness and sleep disturbances.
 Although mothers appreciated and acknowledged efforts from caregivers who were not their first choices, these children were less likely to share the mothers' values and to have the personal characteristics important to the mothers in selecting preferred caregivers.
 This incompatibility can have some strong negative effects." On the flip side, receiving care from a mother's preferred child did not affect the mom's psychological well-being, she said.
 "We expected having that preferred child care for a parent would make a positive difference, but surprisingly it didn't," Suitor said.
 "And we also found that mothers' depressive symptoms were higher when they received care from the non-preferred child than when they received no care from their offspring.
" Suitor, also a faculty member in Purdue's Center on Aging and the Life Course who studies parental favoritism with adult children, collaborated on this research with Megan Gilligan, a Purdue doctoral student, and Karl Pillemer, professor and director of the Cornell Institute for Translational Research on Aging at Cornell University.
 The research was funded by the National Institute on Aging and is online in The Gerontologist. The findings were based on in-person interviews with 234 older mothers as part of a larger study of 566 multigenerational families that began in 2001 when the mothers were 65-75 and had at least two adult children still living.
 All of the mothers were interviewed again seven years later; the new research is based on the 234 women who reported they needed care within the previous two years because of serious injury or illness.
 During the initial interviews, 75 percent of the mothers named a particular child they would prefer provide care if they became ill or disabled.
 This was compared to the children's actual roles seven years later after the mothers needed help. The reasons why preferred children sometimes could not care for their moms were because they moved away or had medical problems themselves.
 Researchers also controlled for family size, and no differences were found based on number of children. The researchers found that being cared for by a non-preferred child is stressful because the alternate caregivers did not possess the social and emotional characteristics that the mothers expected.
 "This matters because it makes people comfortable, and this is especially important when people are under a lot of stress and in situations where they relinquish control to another person," Suitor said.
 "And who do you want to give up control to? To someone who has the same outlook on life and who you think is very much like you, and, therefore, can respond to your needs and be a source of reassuring support.
" For example, one of the moms in the study said that her preferred caregiver, who lives far away, was her preference because they "can talk about anything.
 I think she understands me best." And while the mom acknowledged the daughter caring for her was helpful and reliable, she couldn't talk with her as openly.
 She "would get annoyed with me. Although, she's my rock here because she's the one that's here." These findings are similar to previous work by Suitor and Pillemer that shows these factors are critical in relationships for spouses and adult siblings.
 "As people become older and their health declines, they start placing greater emphasis on relationships with family and friends with whom they have a personal history or an especially close and comfortable relationship, and reducing contact with people with whom they are less comfortable," Gilligan said.
 When asked about the implications of these findings, Suitor said making assumptions about which children mothers want as their caregivers may be problematic.
 Her previous studies on adult children and mothers show that the children accurately predict whether their mothers favor some children over others about 80 percent of the time, but they are correct only about half the time in identifying which child the mom favors regarding closeness, confiding in or for future care.
 "We are not clinicians, but I think there are lessons that can be learned from this research that can be put to use in conversations that families have about advanced care planning," Suitor said.
 "Perhaps these conversations can be expanded to include which children mom would prefer provide her with care. Geography often plays a role in preventing the preferred child from providing care, but perhaps the adult children stepping into the role can call their brother or sister and say, 'I'm thinking about doing this for mom, what do you think?
' Ideally, they can coordinate and avoid conflict." The survey data is part of a 13-year project, the Within-Family Difference Study, led by Suitor and Pillemer to evaluate the role favoritism plays in adult and family relationships.
 The data for the project was collected in the Boston metropolitan area by the Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.
 In the project's next phase, they plan to expand the study of causes and consequences of favoritism to three generations of the families they have been following.
 They also plan to extend the project by collecting data from several hundred multigenerational Hispanic families in the Chicago metropolitan area.

apatterson@purdue.edu ABSTRACT The Role of Violated Caregiver Preferences in Psychological Well-Being When Older Mothers Need Assistance
 Purpose of the study: Theory and research suggest that congruence between individuals' preferences for future care and the patterns of care received will affect well-being.
 In this paper, we explore whether older mothers' psychological well-being was affected by whether the children they preferred as future caregivers provided assistance at a later point when the mothers experienced illness or injury.
 Design and methods: In this article we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collected from 234 older mothers and two points seven years apart, beginning when the mothers were 65-75.
 Results: Multivariate analyses demonstrated that mothers who received assistance from children whom they did not identify as preferred future caregivers reported higher depressive symptoms at T2; receiving care from children identified as preferred caregivers did not affect well-being.
 Qualitative data suggested these patterns occurred because the "alternate" caregivers did not possess the socioemotional attributes of preferred children.
 Implications: These findings contribute to a growing body of research demonstrating the consequences of violated preferences, particularly when individuals are in need of support in later life.

 Study: No-fat, low-fat dressings don't get most nutrients out of salads
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The vegetables in salads are chock-full of important vitamins and nutrients, but you won't get much benefit without the right type and amount of salad dressing, a Purdue University study shows.
 In a human trial, researchers fed subjects salads topped off with saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat-based dressings and tested their blood for absorption of fat-soluble carotenoids – compounds such as lutein, lycopene, beta-carotene and zeaxanthin.
 Those carotenoids are associated with reduced risk of several chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and macular degeneration.
 The study, published early online in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, found that monounsaturated fat-rich dressings required the least amount of fat to get the most carotenoid absorption, while saturated fat and polyunsaturated fat dressings required higher amounts of fat to get the same benefit.
 "If you want to utilize more from your fruits and vegetables, you have to pair them correctly with fat-based dressings," said Mario Ferruzzi, the study's lead author and a Purdue associate professor of food science.
 "If you have a salad with a fat-free dressing, there is a reduction in calories, but you lose some of the benefits of the vegetables.
" In the test, 29 people were fed salads dressed with butter as a saturated fat, canola oil as a monounsaturated fat and corn oil as a polyunsaturated fat.
 Each salad was served with 3 grams, 8 grams or 20 grams of fat from dressing. The soybean oil rich in polyunsaturated fat was the most dependent on dose.
 The more fat on the salad, the more carotenoids the subjects absorbed. The saturated fat butter was also dose-dependent, but to a lesser extent.
 Monounsaturated fat-rich dressings, such as canola and olive oil-based dressings, promoted the equivalent carotenoid absorption at 3 grams of fat as it did 20 grams, suggesting that this lipid source may be a good choice for those craving lower fat options but still wanting to optimize absorption of health-promoting carotenoids from fresh vegetables.
 "Even at the lower fat level, you can absorb a significant amount of carotenoids with monounsaturated fat-rich canola oil," Ferruzzi said.
 "Overall, pairing with fat matters. You can absorb significant amounts of carotenoids with saturated or polyunsaturated fats at low levels, but you would see more carotenoid absorption as you increase the amounts of those fats on a salad.
" The findings build on a 2004 Iowa State University study that determined carotenoids were more bioavailable – absorbed by the intestines – when paired with full-fat dressing as opposed to low-fat or fat-free versions.
 Ferruzzi; Wayne Campbell, a Purdue professor of nutrition science; Shellen Goltz, a Purdue graduate student in food science; and their collaborators, Chureeporn Chitchumroonchokchai and Mark L.
 Failla at Ohio State University, are the first to study different types of fats in differing amounts in human subjects. Ferruzzi and colleagues will next work on understanding how meal patterning affects nutrient absorption.
 He is trying to determine whether people absorb more nutrients if they eat vegetables at one time or if consumption is spread throughout the day.
 ABSTRACT Shellen R. Goltz, Wayne M. Campbell, Chureeporn Chitchumroonchokchai, Mark L. Failla, Mario G. Ferruzzi Scope: Dietary lipids are considered to be primary potentiators of carotenoid absorption, yet the amount and source required to optimize bioavailability has not been systematically evaluated.
 The objective of this study was to examine the impact of both amount and source of triacylglycerols on postprandial absorption of carotenoids from vegetable salads.
 Methods and results: Healthy subjects (n = 29) were randomized using a Latin square design (3x3) and consumed three identical salads with 3, 8 or 20 g of canola oil, soybean oil or butter.
 Blood was collected from 0–10 h and triacylglycerol-rich fractions (TRLs) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Carotenoid contents of TRL fractions were analyzed by HPLC-DAD.
 Considering all lipid sources, 20 g of lipid promoted higher absorption compared to 3 and 8 g for all carotenoid species (p < 0.05), except for α -carotene (p = 0.07).
 The source of lipid had less impact on the absorption of carotenoids than amount of lipid. Pooling results from all lipid amounts, monounsaturated fatty acid rich canola oil trended toward enhancing absorption of lutein and α -carotene compared to saturated fatty acid rich butter (p = 0.06 and p = 0.08, respectively).
 Conclusion: While both amount and source of co-consumed lipid affect carotenoid bioavailability from vegetables, amount appears to exert a stronger effect.

 Study shines light on ways to cut costs for greenhouse growers
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Greenhouse bedding plant growers can save themselves time, money or possibly both by giving cuttings in propagation more light, according to a Purdue University study.
 Flower growers use cuttings from Central America and Africa to start spring bedding plants in greenhouses during winter and early spring.
 Those cloudy days and cool temperatures make propagation time- and energy-intensive. Roberto Lopez, an assistant professor of horticulture, and horticulture graduate students Chris Currey and Veronica Hutchinson study ways to minimize inputs and production costs in the floriculture industry while improving product quality.
 Based on what they were hearing from growers, they realized that light wasn't getting the attention it needed from the industry.
 "In their minds, temperature has always been the most important thing. They didn't think about light," Lopez said. "We knew that light was significant, but we realize we didn't know what level to recommend.
" Currey said growers were concerned that using too much light would stress the cuttings and disrupt root development. "The dogma has been to keep light low, but that actually made the cuttings take longer to root," said Currey, whose findings were published in the January issue of the journal 
HortScience. Currey, Hutchinson and Lopez propagated nine popular spring bedding plants under differing amounts of light for two weeks.
 They took a quality index used in forestry and modified it for bedding plants to assess the quality of the plants based on the light levels.
 They measured stem length, stem caliper, shoot dry mass and root dry mass. Overall, plants rooted faster with more light and the plants were higher quality.
 Both factors could increase profits for greenhouse growers, Lopez said. "With reduced production time, you can save on production costs or increase your crop production by starting another second crop that wouldn't have been possible with reduced light," Currey said.
 "That's increased profits through greenhouse space savings or energy savings, as well as through a higher quality product." Next, Lopez and Currey plan to study the morphological and physiological changes associated with light and cutting propagation, as well as how LED lights can be used to add supplemental daily light for cuttings.

 Cuttings of herbaceous annual bedding plants must be rooted in late winter and early spring when ambient outdoor photosynthetic daily light integrals (DLIs) are at seasonally low levels.
 We evaluated the effect of DLI during root development on growth, morphology, and quality of nine popular vegetatively propagated annual bedding plant species.
 Cuttings of Angelonia angustifolia Benth. 'AngelMist White Cloud,' Argyranthemum frutescens (L.) Sch. Bip. 'Madeira Cherry Red,' 
Diascia barberae Hook. f. 'Wink Coral,' Lantana camara L. 'Lucky Gold,' Nemesia fruticans (Thunb.) Benth. 'Aromatica Royal,' Osteospermum ecklonis
 (DC.) Norl. 'Voltage Yellow,' Scaevola L. hybrid 'Blue Print,' Sutera cordata Roth. 'Abunda Giant White,' and Verbena Ruiz ×hybrida
 'Aztec Violet' were harvested and propagated in a glass-glazed greenhouse with 23 °C air and substrate temperature set points. After callusing (≈5 mol·m
−2·d−1 for 7 days), cuttings of each species were placed under one of three different fixed-woven shade cloths providing ≈38%, 61%, or 86% shade or no shade with 16 h of supplemental light for 14 days.
 There were no clear trends across species for stem length in response to DLI. Stem caliper of Argyranthemum, Diascia, and Nemesia
 increased by 35%, 119%, and 89%, respectively, as DLI increased from 1.2 to 12.3 mol·m−2·d−1. Depending on species, total, shoot, and root dry mass increased by 64% to 465%, 50% to 384%, and 156% to 1137%, respectively, as DLI increased from 1.2 to 12.3 mol·m
−2·d−1. The quality index, an objective, integrated, and quantitative measurement of rooted cutting quality, increased for all species by 176% to 858% as DLI increased from 1.2 to 12.3 mol·m
−2·d−1. Our results indicate that providing a DLI of ≈8 to 12 mol·m−2·d−1 after callusing increases both growth and quality of rooted cuttings.

 Superconductor 'flaws' could be key to its abilities

 (Purdue University photo/Mark Simons)Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Many researchers studying superconductivity strive to create a clean, pure, perfect sample, but a team of physicists found that some flaws might hold the key to a material's unique abilities.
 Erica Carlson, a Purdue University associate professor of physics, led a team that mapped seemingly random, four-atom-wide dark lines of electrons seen on the surface of copper-oxygen based superconducting crystals.
 The team uncovered a pattern in these flawed lines, which are separate from the expected structure of the material, and discovered that they exist throughout the crystal.
 The findings suggest the lines could play a role in the material's superconductivity at much higher temperatures than others. "This material is ceramic, like your dinner plates, and it has no business conducting electricity, but under the right conditions it conducts electricity perfectly with zero energy loss," Carlson said.
 "A better understanding of how and why this superconductor works could help us design better ones. If we can create a superconductor that works at high enough temperatures, it could transform how we use and generate energy.
" For instance, room temperature superconductive wires could lead to power lines that do not leak electricity in transit, saving tremendous amounts of energy and money.
 Superconductors also have special magnetic properties that could allow for levitated, frictionless trains and stronger, more durable permanent magnets like those used in wind turbines, she said.
 The electrons confined to these mysterious lines behave radically different than those that freely move throughout the crystal, and it had been suggested that they could play a role in superconductivity.
 However, whether the lines were merely surface effects or extended into the material was unknown because the scanning tunneling microscopy that reveals them can only be used on the material's surface, she said.
 Carlson collaborated with Karin Dahmen from the University of Illinois and Purdue graduate student Benjamin Phillabaum on a study to examine the tiny, ladderlike lines that point vertically or horizontally across the surface of the crystal.
 By treating sets of neighboring parallel lines as part of a single "cluster," the team discovered that the patterns formed by the clusters are fractal in nature, meaning they fall between two dimensions of space, Carlson said.
 "When thinking of a fractal, imagine a crumpled piece of paper," she said. "It is more than the two-dimensional flat piece of paper and it enters three dimensions, but it does not quite fill that space.
 It is not a true and solid ball. Fractals can occupy fractions of a dimension. They also have a pattern that is maintained even as you view smaller and smaller pieces of it.
" Fractal patterns are mathematically understood, and the patterns present on the surface of the copper-oxygen based high-temperature superconductors could be compared to known models of how that pattern can arise.
 Using this information, the team was able to determine that these patterns originate from deep inside the material. A paper detailing the NSF and Research Corporation for Science Advancement-funded research was published in 
Nature Communications. The fractal patterns also offer information about the space they occupy, and through this work the team developed a new analysis method to help understand the materials and the interactions going on inside of them, Carlson said.
 "If you see pattern formation, then you can try to identify the fundamental physics causing its formation," she said. "It can apply to a lot of systems and materials beyond superconductors.
" Carlson said the method could be used to identify the dominant class of disorder present in a material, which helps in understanding its unique characteristics.
 "We want to move beyond trying to get rid of disorder, striving for unattainable purity in the materials we examine, and instead take the disorder into account and use it to our advantage," Carlson said.
 "These little patches of imperfection where things aren't lined up in a perfect crystal lattice are important, and old methods that overlooked them fail to capture important physics.
 The flaws in the lines are like a fingerprint. They reveal the identity deeper inside." ABSTRACT Surface probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy have detected complex electronic patterns at the nanoscale in many high-temperature superconductors.
 In cuprates, the pattern formation is associated with the pseudogap phase, a precursor to the high-temperature superconducting state.
 Rotational symmetry breaking of the host crystal in the form of electronic nematicity has recently been proposed as a unifying theme of the pseudogap phase.
 However, the fundamental physics governing the nanoscale pattern formation has not yet been identified. Here we introduce a new set of methods for analyzing strongly correlated electronic systems, including the effects of both disorder and broken symmetry.
 We use universal cluster properties extracted from scanning tunneling microscopy studies of cuprate superconductors to identify the fundamental physics controlling the complex pattern formation.
 Because of a delicate balance between disorder, interactions and material anisotropy, we find that the electron nematic is fractal in nature, and that it extends throughout the bulk of the material.

 Survey: Indiana farmland values, cash rents soar
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana's farmland values and cash rents have continued to soar in 2012, even amid the worst drought in decades, according to a June 2012 Purdue University survey.
 The Purdue Farmland Value Survey showed a statewide increase in farmland value ranging from 14.3 percent to 18.1 percent, depending on land quality, since the 2011 survey.
 Cash rents increased between 12.8 percent and 15.2 percent. "Robust net farm incomes, favorable interest rates, strong farmland demand and a limited supply of farmland for sale kept Indiana farmland values and cash rents moving higher," said Craig Dobbins, Purdue Extension agricultural economist.
 Statewide the average value of bare Indiana cropland ranged from $5,013 per acre for poor-quality land to $7,704 per acre for top-quality land.
 To assess farmland productivity, survey respondents estimated long-term corn yields for poor-, average- and top-quality land. For the state, the average long-term corn yields for poor, average and top were 126, 159 and 192 bushels per acre, respectively.
 The farmland value increases are good news for landowners, but not necessarily for some prospective buyers, Dobbins said. "For the landowners, the increase is generally a good thing," he said.
 "It makes the asset that much more valuable and if they are thinking about selling it, they can sell it for a good price. "If you're someone who is trying to start out or get into farming, this news isn't all that good.
 It just makes it more difficult to make a farmland purchase. According to Dobbins, 2012 was the year many thought crop production margins and thus farmland values would level out or even fall.
 But the season-long drought hiked grain prices and the prospects of higher 2013 and maybe 2014 grain prices led to higher farmland values.
 Values of farmland moving out of agriculture, called transitional land, also are on the rise after a four-year decline. The 2012 average value was $8,505, up 7.2 percent from 2011.
 "This is a specialized market with the transitional land value strongly influenced by the planned use and location," Dobbins said.
 "The estimated value of farmland in this market has a very wide range." For example, transitional land value estimates in the June survey ranged from $2,500 per acre to $21,000.
 Because of those variations, Dobbins said the median transitional land value of $8,000 per acre is likely more meaningful than the average.
 That number represents an increase in value of $750 per acre. The survey also looked at the value of rural recreational land, which includes land used for hunting and other recreational activities.
 The average value of an acre of recreational land was $3,489, an increase of 3.9 percent from 2011. The median value in June 2012 was $3,000 per acre - the same as last year.
 "As with transitional land, there is a wide range of values for rural recreational land, again making the median value a more meaningful indicator than arithmetic average," Dobbins said.
 This year's survey includes responses from 276 farm managers, appraisers, land brokers, agricultural loan officers, Purdue Extension educators, farmers and professionals representing the Farm Credit System, the Farm Service Agency county offices and insurance companies.
 Respondents represented six Indiana regions and all but four Indiana counties. A full assessment of the survey results and more information about respondents and data gathering methods are available in the August 2012 edition of the Purdue Agricultural Economics Report at

 Technology developed to help property managers, landlords organize rental turn-over process
 Make Ready Manager helps property managers and landlords organize the turn-over process, including assigning move-out tasks to employees or vendors.
 The software is commercialized by Key Rental Properties and developed by DelMar Information Technologies. (DelMar Information Technologies image)
 LAFAYETTE, Ind. and WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Property managers and landlords may be able to oversee the rental turn-over process more efficiently, thanks to a new version of technology developed in Greater Lafayette.
 Lafayette, Ind.-based Key Rental Solutions LLC is commercializing a cloud-based version of Make Ready Manager®, which was developed by Purdue Research Park-based DelMar Information Technologies LLC.
 Users gain access to the program from any location with an Internet connection, not just computers in their office. It also now has a Task List, a mobile-optimized website that allows workers and vendors to use their smartphones to view jobs on a list, like rekeying locks or cleaning carpets, and mark them as complete.
 Andy Smith, director of sales and marketing at Key Rental Solutions, said moving the program to the cloud allows more flexibility for the end user.
 "Property managers now can perform tasks, review reports, assign tasks to vendors and workers at the site, and see what has to be done and what has to be completed from a remote location," he said.
 "They don't need to wait until the end of the day or the next day with a paper that lists what was accomplished." Smith said Make Ready Manager has been used for apartment communities, student housing, condominiums and commercial sites.
 "It provides a simpler method to track the process of turning over empty units and making them available. It can be updated much faster than a whiteboard," he said.
 "The user also can look at the history of what's been done to a unit, which they can't get off a whiteboard or a spreadsheet." Mikel Berger, software developer at DelMar Information Technologies, said several standard turn-over practices like move-out inspection, painting and carpet cleaning are built into the Make Ready Manager system.
 Users can add or delete practices to customize the program and its reports. "Users can search for what jobs have been assigned to employees or vendors, and notify them about the jobs with one or two clicks," he said.
 "Creating reports is an easy process because it is a function of the system." Smith said Make Ready Manager can stand alone or be integrated with existing full-service property management software.
 "There are several complete property management systems but they lack a simple, easy-to-use way to manage turn-overs. Most don't have anything, or they're limited or difficult to use," he said.
 "Our software works with and integrates with the most popular property management software. The user doesn't need to maintain separate lists of units for both.
" Dean Bellas, assistant operations manager with Capstone On-Campus Management at Bowling Green State University, turned to Make Ready Manager because he and his colleagues were not able to look at one place to see what units needed to be turned over and what tasks had to be done.
 They also had to use paper and pencil to pass information to the staff during the turn-over process. "I like that Make Ready Manager has the ability to track each step in the turn process, which can be tracked either very broadly or by each individual task," Bellas said.
 "It allows my colleagues and me to effectively manage what tasks were assigned to whom and when they are expected to be done." Michael Rapp, director of administration at Campus Property Management, said he and his colleagues faced a challenge in organizing information so key people knew what was happening during the turn-over process.
 "We exported the unit information from our database and imported it into Make Ready Manager for use in just a few minutes," he said.
 "We no longer have to track down individuals to see if something has been done, we can just check the program. Make Ready has greatly improved our organization of turn-over which has made us more efficient.
" A demonstration of Make Ready Manager can be found at http://www.makereadymanager.com. Visitors also can download a sample or purchase the program at the same site.

 TEST-video-photo-abstract
 Members of the Jefferson High School football team, seen here during practice, were monitored in research to learn how impacts to the head affect brain function.
 (Purdue University file photo/Andrew Hancock) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A two-year study of high schoolfootball players suggests that concussions are likely caused by many hits overtime and not from a single blow to the head, as commonly believed.
 Purdue University researchers have studied footballplayers for two seasons at Jefferson High School in Lafayette, Ind., where 21players completed the study the first season and 24 the second season,including 16 repeating players.
 Helmet-sensor impact data from each player were comparedwith brain-imaging scans and cognitive tests performed before, during and aftereach season.
 "The most important implication of the new findingsis the suggestion that a concussion is not just the result of a single blow,but it's really the totality of blows that took place over the season,"said 
Eric Nauman, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and anexpert in central nervous system and musculoskeletal trauma. "The one hitthat brought on the concussion is arguably the straw that broke the camel'sback.
" Researchers evaluated players using a type of brainimaging technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, alongwith a computer-based neurocognitive screening test.
 The fMRI scans revealwhich parts of the brain are most active during specific tasks. Thomas Talavage, an expert in functional neuroimaging andco-director of the Purdue MRI Facility, said the scans indicate players areadapting their mental processes to deal with brain changes.
 Brain scans show differences among high school football players in a two-year study that suggests concussions are likely caused by many hits over time and not from a single blow to the head, as commonly believed.
 (Purdue University image/Thomas Talavage) "The changes in brain activity we are observingsuggest that a player is having to use a different strategy to perform a task,and that is likely because functional capacity is reduced," Talavage said.
"The level of change in the fMRI signal is significantly correlated to thenumber and distribution of hits that a player takes. Performance doesn'tchange, but brain activity changes, showing that certain areas are no longerbeing recruited to perform a task.
" Findings, detailed in a paper to appear online in the Journal of Biomechanics, are contrary toconventional thinking. "Most clinicians would say that if you don't have anyconcussion symptoms you have no problems," said 
Larry Leverenz, an expertin athletic training and a clinical professor of health and kinesiology."However, we are finding that there is actually a lot of change, even whenyou don't have symptoms.
" The paper was written by mechanical engineering graduatestudent Evan Breedlove, Nauman, Leverenz, Talavage, former Purdue professor ofeducational studies Jeffrey Gilger, biomedical engineering graduate studentMeghan Robinson, health and kinesiology graduate student Katherine E.
 Morigaki,electrical and computer engineering graduate student Umit Yoruk, mechanicalengineering undergraduate student Kyle O'Keefe, and undergraduate student inelectrical and computer engineering Jeffrey King.
 Gilger is now a researcher atthe University of California, Merced. The research may help to determine how many blows it takesto cause impairment, which could lead to safety guidelines on limiting thenumber of hits a player receives per week.
 "Any change in fMRI data is a concern, but we don'tyet know what these changes mean, what they translate to, in terms of cognitiveimpairment," Breedlove said.
 A common assumption in sports medicine is that certainpeople are innately more susceptible to head injury. However, the new findingssuggest the number of hits received during the course of a season is the mostimportant factor, Talavage said.
 "Over the two seasons we had six concussed players,but 17 of the players showed brain changes even though they did not haveconcussions," Talavage said.
 "There is good correlation with thenumber of hits players received, but we need more subjects." The researchers have expanded the study to include anadditional high school football team and girls' soccer.
 "We want to increase the number of football playersin the study and also include soccer to study athletes who don't wear headprotection," Nauman said.
 "We also want to include girls to seewhether they are affected differently than boys." The research findings represent a dilemma because theysuggest athletes may suffer a form of injury that is difficult to diagnose.
 "This might be especially important in young peoplebecause the brain is still developing, so even though subtle unexpressed damagedoesn't manifest as a concussion it could affect the brain later in life,"Gilger said.
 Changes were seen in regions of the brain that have beenassociated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressivedegenerative disease found in people who suffer numerous concussions and otherforms of head injury.
 "This is still circumstantial evidence, but itsuggests that whether you are concussed or not your brain is changing as aresult of all these hits, and the regions most affected are the ones thatexhibit CTE," Nauman said.
 Players in the study received from 200 to nearly 1,900hits to the head in a single season, with two players exceeding 1,800 hits.Helmet-sensor data indicated impact forces to the head ranged from 20 Gs tomore than 100 Gs.
 Findings could aid efforts to develop more sensitive andaccurate methods to detect cognitive impairment and concussions; moreaccurately characterize and model cognitive deficits that result from headimpacts; determine the cellular basis for cognitive deficits after a singleimpact or repeated impacts; and develop new interventions to reduce the riskand effects of head impacts.
 "Now that we know there is definitely a buildup ofdamage before the concussion occurs, ultimately, there is hope that we can domore to prevent concussions," Nauman said.
 The work is ongoing and supported with grants from theIndiana State Department of Health's Spinal Cord and Brain Injury ResearchFund, General Electric Healthcare, the Indiana Clinical and TranslationalSciences Institute, and through the National Science Foundation and NationalDefense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowships.
 Researchers also will follow the case studies of playerswho take the most hits to see if there is evidence of permanent changes inbrain structure using MRI scans.
 The research group, called the Purdue Neurotrauma Group(PNG), also is studying ways to reduce traumatic brain injury in soldiers whosuffer concussions caused by shock waves from explosions.

 Recently, attention has shifted toward subconcussive blows and the role they may play in the development of CTE. We assembled a cohort of high school football players for two seasons of observation.
 Accelerations sensors were placed in the helmets, and all contact activity was monitored. Pre-season computer-based neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests were also obtained in order to assess cognitive and physiological health.
 In-season follow-up scans were then obtained both from individuals who had sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion and those who had not.
 These changes were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan.
 In addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion, a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes.
 Stepwise regression indicated distinct relationships between the biomechanical histories of subjects and the ensuing neurophysiological change, suggesting that distinct injury processes are at play.
 Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that the effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative and that repeated exposure to subconcussive blows is connected to pathologically altered neurophysiology.

 Tiny 'spherules' reveal details about Earth's asteroid impacts
 Researchers are learning details about asteroid impacts going back to the Earth's early history by using a new method for extracting precise information from tiny "spherules" embedded in layers of rock.
 The spherules were created when asteroids crashed into Earth, vaporizing rock that expanded as a giant vapor plume. Small droplets of molten rock in the plume condensed and solidified, falling back to the surface as a thin layer.
 This sample was found in Western Australia and formed 2.63 billion years ago in the aftermath of a large impact. (Oberlin College photo/Bruce M.
 Simonson) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Researchers are learning detailsabout asteroid impacts going back to the Earth's early history by using a newmethod for extracting precise information from tiny "spherules"embedded in layers of rock.
 The spherules were created when asteroids crashed into theEarth, vaporizing rock that expanded into space as a giant vapor plume.
 Smalldroplets of molten and vaporized rock in the plume condensed and solidified,falling back to Earth as a thin layer. The round or oblong particles werepreserved in layers of rock, and now researchers have analyzed them to recordprecise information about asteroids impacting Earth from 3.5 billion to 35million years ago.
 "What we have done is provide the foundation forunderstanding how to interpret the layers in terms of the size and velocity ofthe asteroid that made them," said
 Jay Melosh, an expert in impactcratering and a distinguished professor of earth and atmospheric sciences,physics and aerospace engineering at Purdue University.
 Findings, which support a theory that the Earth endured anespecially heavy period of asteroid bombardment early in its history, aredetailed in a research paper appearing online in the journal Nature on Wednesday (April 25).
 Thepaper was written by Purdue physics graduate student Brandon Johnson and Melosh.The findings, based on geologic observations, support a theoretical study in acompanion paper in Nature byresearchers at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo.
 The period of heavy asteroid bombardment - from 4.2 to 3.5billion years ago - is thought to have been influenced by changes in the earlysolar system that altered the trajectory of objects in an asteroid belt locatedbetween Mars and Jupiter, sending them on a collision course with Earth.
 "That's the postulate, and this is the first realsolid evidence that it actually happened," Melosh said. "Some of theasteroids that we infer were about 40 kilometers in diameter, much larger thanthe one that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago that was about12-15 kilometers.
 But when we looked at the number of impactors as a functionof size, we got a curve that showed a lot more small objects than large ones, apattern that matches exactly the distribution of sizes in the asteroid belt.For the first time we have a direct connection between the crater sizedistribution on the ancient Earth and the sizes of asteroids out inspace.
" Because craters are difficult to study directly, impacthistory must be inferred either by observations of asteroids that periodicallypass near the Earth or by studying craters on the moon.
 Now, the new techniqueusing spherules offers a far more accurate alternative to chronicle asteroidimpacts on Earth, Melosh said.
 "We can look at these spherules, see how thick thelayer is, how big the spherules are, and we can infer the size and velocity ofthe asteroid," Melosh said.
 "We can go back to the earliest era inthe history of the Earth and infer the population of asteroids impacting theplanet." For asteroids larger than about 10 kilometers in diameter,the spherules are deposited in a global layer.
 "Some of these impacts were several times larger thanthe Chicxulub impact that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago,"Johnson said.
 "The impacts may have played a large role in the evolutionalhistory of life. The large number of impacts may have helped simple life byintroducing organics and other important materials at a time when life on Earthwas just taking hold.
" A 40-kilometer asteroid would have wiped out everything onthe Earth's surface, whereas the one that struck 65 million years ago killedonly land animals weighing more than around 20 kilograms.
 "Impactcraters are the most obvious indication of asteroid impacts, but craters onEarth are quickly obscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonicprocesses," Johnson said.
 "However, the spherule layers, if preservedin the geologic record, provide information about an impact even when thesource crater cannot be found.
" The Purdue researchers studied the spherules usingcomputer models that harness mathematical equations developed originally tocalculate the condensation of vapor.
 "There have been some new wrinkles in vaporcondensation modeling that motivated us to do this work, and we were the firstto apply it to asteroid impacts," Melosh said.
 The researchers also are studying a different type ofartifact similar to spherules but found only near the original impact site.Whereas the globally distributed spherules come from the condensing vaporizedrock, these "melt droplets" are from rock that's been melted and notcompletely vaporized.
 "Before this work, it was not possible to distinguishbetween these two types of formations," Melosh said. "Nobody hadestablished criteria for discriminating between them, and we've done thatnow.
" One of the authors of the Southwest Research Institutepaper, David Minton, is now an assistant professor of earth and atmosphericsciences at Purdue.
 Findings from the research may enable Melosh's team toenhance an asteroid impact effects calculator he developed to estimate whatwould happen if asteroids of various sizes were to hit the Earth.
 Thecalculator, "Impact: Earth!" allows anyone to calculate potentialcomet or asteroid damage based on the object's mass. Note to Journalists
: An electronic copy of the research paper is available by contacting Nature at press@nature.com Impact craters are themost obvious indication of asteroid impacts, but craters on Earth are quicklyobscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonic processes1.
 Earth'simpact history is inferred therefore either from estimates of the present-dayimpactor flux as determined by observations of near-Earth asteroids, or fromthe Moon's incomplete impact chronology.
 Asteroids hitting Earth typicallyvaporize a mass of target rock comparable to the projectile's mass. As this vaporexpands in a large plume or fireball, it cools and condenses into moltendroplets called spherules.
 For asteroids larger than about 10 kilometers indiameter, these spherules are deposited in a global layer. Spherule layerspreserved in the geologic record accordingly provide information about animpact even when the source crater cannot be found.
 Here, we report estimatesof the sizes and impact velocities of the asteroids that created globalspherule layers. The impact chronology from these spherule layers reveals thatthe impactor flux was significantly higher 3.5 billion years ago than it isnow.
 This conclusion is consistent with a gradual decline of the impactor fluxafter the Late Heavy Bombardment.

 Tradition bends to allow Silver Twins to continue
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - In April 2012 it looked like Purdue University's Ross-Ade Stadium might not have that splash of silver known as the Silver Twins for the fall football season.
 No identical twins attended Purdue Bands' auditions for feature twirlers. Jordan Foster of Attleboro, Mass., and Alyssa Lyzen of Brecksville, Ohio, had both been twirling for 13 years, but their paths had never crossed until that April day.
 Twirling as Silver Twins never occurred to them because the position has been reserved for identical twins. They were going after Girl in Black or a spot on the twirling line.
 But, after a month of careful consideration, Purdue bands director Jay Gephart decided not to subtract silver from Purdue's sparkling lineup of twirlers.
 He asked the two talented brunettes - Foster and Lyzen - to consider joining forces. Both said yes immediately and have spent the summer getting to know each other and matching their skills so fans will see that similarity in style that has always marked the Silver Twins.
 Foster and Lyzen will make their twirling debut as Purdue's Silver Twins at the Purdue "All-American" Marching Band Preview at 7:30 Saturday (Aug.
 18), at Hull Drill Field next to the Fire Station on Third Street. The public is invited, and admission is free. Returning Golden Girl MerrieBeth Cox and Girl in Black Cecelia Daizovi will twirl as well.
 Although she's new to her position, Daizovi has significant ties to the Girl in Black position. Both her mother, Kim Ratcliffe Daizovi, and her aunt, Kelli Ratcliffe Ruble, twirled as the Girl in Black at Purdue.
 All three of the new feature twirlers boast significant accomplishments. Daizovi, who's been twirling since age 5, is the current USA National Baton Twirling champion in two events and current Team USA Junior Women's gold medalist.
 Foster won the Twirlmania High School Classic and has made the top six in the National Baton Twirling Association's Grand Nationals for two years in a row.
 Lyzen won four national championships with Drum Majorettes of America and was selected for the U.S. All-Star Team to twirl in the Macy's Parade.
 Enthusiasm for their surprise pairing as Silver Twins exudes from Foster, a freshman communications major, and Lyzen, a freshman accounting major whose future interests lie in law.
 "I'm really excited to open people's eyes that we aren't twins, while mesmerizing them with how twin-like we are," Foster says. "I want them to be blown away that we aren't twins but twirl like twins.
" Lyzen's mother is also a twirler and was inspired to start twirling after she saw a performance by the Purdue Silver Twins. "I'm fascinated with the whole Purdue tradition, and now to be part of that tradition is mind boggling," she says.
 "I can't wait to learn more and make the position new and even better."

 Trustees elect Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. as Purdue's 12th president
 Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels talks with students outside Stewart Center following the announcement that he will become Purdue University's 12th President.
 (Purdue University photo) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The Purdue Board of Trustees onThursday (June 21) unanimously selected Indiana Gov.
 Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. tobe the university's next president. Daniels will start in January at the conclusion of hissecond term as governor.
 He will be Purdue's 12th president, succeeding FranceA. Córdova, who will step down July 15. Keith Krach, board chairman, heralded Daniels' appointmentas "an innovative, game-changing move for Purdue.
" "Gov. Mitch Daniels will continue to raise the globalprofile of Purdue. He's committed to the success of our land-grant institution,he's an advocate for economic progress through innovative research and he'smade Indiana the state to watch for the last several years," Krach said.
 "Withhis leadership, intellect and passion for higher education, there's no limit tothe greatness Purdue can achieve." Daniels praised Purdue as an invaluable asset for Indianaand the country and as an educational institution globally renowned forproducing discoveries and graduates in high demand.
 Daniels said his first priority would be to learn from thefaculty and earn their trust and collaboration to help further Purdue'sresearch and education missions.
 "No institution of any kind means more to Indianatoday or tomorrow as Purdue University. It educates at the highest level theengineers, scientists, agricultural experts and information technologists onwhom our state and national success disproportionately depend," Danielssaid.
 "Its research gives rise to the innovative new goods,services and companies on which American and Hoosier prosperity must be built.I can conceive of no other assignment in which a person has the chance tocontribute more to building the kind of Indiana of which we dream.
" Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels speaks in Loeb Playhouse after being elected Thursday (June 21) by Purdue Board of Trustees as the university's 12th president.
 Seated is Trustees chair Keith Krach. (Purdue Photo by Steven Yang) Daniels has often praised Purdue in his eight years as Indiana'schief economic development officer, saying "what is taught so well here atPurdue is what the nation and the state need most: math, science, engineering,agricultural science - the critical intellectual building blocks of a winningnational economy.
" Daniels, Indiana's 49th governor, was electedin 2004 and re-elected in 2008 with the largest number of votes ever recordedby any candidate for public office in state history.
 Chief among hisaccomplishments are turning a state budget deficit into a surplus, launchingIndiana into the top ranks of business-friendly states, and reforming andimproving the performance of government across the board.
 Daniels has held a variety of top-level positions inbusiness and politics. He worked 11 years at Eli Lilly and Co., includingservice as president of the company's North American Pharmaceutical Operations.Previously, he was CEO of the Hudson Institute, then a contract researchorganization known for its analyses of the central role of technology in human progress,among other issues.
 He also served as an adviser to President Ronald Reagan, directorof the Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush, and chiefof staff for Indiana Sen.
 Richard Lugar. Daniels was widely viewed in 2011 as aviable candidate for the U.S. presidency before choosing not to run. He is the author of two books, "Keeping the Republic:Saving America by Trusting Americans" and "Notes from the Road,"a chronicle of his Indiana travels as a first-time political candidate.
 Daniels earned a bachelor's degree with honors from theWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at PrincetonUniversity in 1971 and a law degree from Georgetown University in 1979.
 He isthe recipient of eight honorary degrees, from institutions including ButlerUniversity, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Wabash College.
 Córdova, Purdue's 11th president, said Daniels' experienceas a leader in the top levels of business and government will serve Purduewell.
 "Gov. Daniels has said that the quality of Purdue'sfaculty is its strength. He is committed to excellence in the faculty ranks andwill continue to hire and retain talented faculty members.
 He understands thevalue of superb staff, having hired many in his diverse leadership roles. Likeall of us in the academy, he is committed to student success," Córdovasaid.
 "The challenges faced by public research universities today aregreat, and Purdue is fortunate to have found a focused, experienced leader inMitch Daniels.
" Córdova guided the university through the most severeeconomic downturn since the Great Depression, working to preserve the qualityof a Purdue education and the value of a Purdue degree, boosting the studentexperience, and increasing research funding and technology transfer to improveboth discovery and delivery for economic impact.
 She also focused on sustainingPurdue's financial future through cost containment and developing a decadalfunding plan to generate new sources of revenue.
 During her tenure, faculty accomplishments included a Nobel Prizein Chemistry, two World Food Prizes, and two National Medals of Technology andInnovation.
 Founded in 1869, Purdue is an Association of AmericanUniversities (AAU), Big Ten Conference, land-grant university system with fourcampuses.

 Trustees ratify appointments, approve new degree programs
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — The Purdue University Board of Trustees on Friday (July 20) ratified appointments of top administrators at the West Lafayette and Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne campuses.
 Trustees also confirmed the appointments of two named professors, approved three new degree programs and ratified the appointments of several regional campus administrators.
 The board ratified Timothy D. Sands as acting president of Purdue and Victor Lechtenberg as acting vice president for academic affairs and provost.
 Sands, who has been at Purdue since 2002 and served as executive vice president for academic affairs and provost since 2010, will be acting president until January when Gov.
 Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. becomes the university's 12th president. Lechtenberg has held several key leadership positions over four decades at Purdue, including interim provost from 2007-2008.
 He will be acting provost until January. Vicky L. Carwein (pronounced CAR-wine) was ratified as chancellor of IPFW, effective Sept.
 1. Carwein is chancellor at Washington State University Tri-Cities in Richland, Wash. Prior to that, she served as president at Westfield State College in Westfield, Mass.
, and chancellor at the University of Washington Tacoma. Carwein also served at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, beginning as an instructor before leaving 23 years later as dean of the College of Health Sciences.
 She earned bachelor's and doctoral degrees in nursing from Indiana University-Indianapolis (now IUPUI) and her master's degree in nursing from the University of California, San Francisco.
 Trustees also approved the IPFW appointments of Walter J. Branson as acting chancellor and Steven T. Sarratore as interim vice chancellor for academic affairs.
 Branson, who began serving as acting chancellor on July 1, has been vice chancellor for financial affairs at IPFW since 1993. As chief financial officer, Branson is responsible for the budgetary and financial control of the campus.
 He directs the operations of six departments employing more than 280 people; serves as the campus public records officer; and oversees the operation of the Indiana–Purdue Foundation at Fort Wayne.
 He received his bachelor's degree from Purdue and worked for 15 years in several positions at Purdue's West Lafayette campus before coming to IPFW.
 Sarratore, who has been at IPFW since 1986, is associate vice chancellor for academic programs. He also is a professor of theater.
 His previous assignments have included chair of the theater department, interim chair of the music department, and interim dean of visual and performing arts.
 Prior to IPFW, he was on the faculty at Ashland University. He earned his MFA degree from Wayne State University. Trustees also ratified David Radcliffe as Kamyar Haghighi Head of the School of Engineering Education and Arvind Varma as the Jay and Cynthia Ihlenfeld Head of Chemical Engineering, both at the West Lafayette campus.
 Radcliffe, who has been at Purdue since 2007, was named associate head of the school in January 2009 and interim head in July 2009.
 He has served as head of the School of Engineering Education since 2010. He also has served as the Epistemology Professor of Engineering Education and chair of the graduate program.
 His research interests include interdisciplinary research methods in engineering education, design thinking and engineering knowledge creation, engineering design and design management in industry, sustainable systems design, and professional formation of engineers in practice.
 Radcliffe came to Purdue after 18 years at the University of Queensland in Australia. He has worked at various other universities and with industry in both Australia and the United States.
 He founded the Catalyst Research Centre for Society and Technology to create solutions to complex social and technological challenges facing industry and the community by considering both social science and engineering aspects.
 Radcliffe was named the inaugural National Teaching Fellow of 1994 in Australia and the first Australian Boeing Welliver Fellow.
 He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Queensland and a doctorate in bioengineering from Strathclyde University in Scotland.
 Varma is the R. Games Slayter Distinguished Professor and head of the School of Chemical Engineering and came to Purdue in 2004.
 Before that he was on the faculty at the University of Notre Dame, beginning in 1975, serving as chair from 1982-1988 and as the inaugural Arthur J.
 Schmitt Professor from 1988-2003. He was founder and director of the Center for Molecularly Engineered Materials at Notre Dame. He also has worked as a senior research engineer for Union Carbide Corp.
 A fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Institute of Chemists and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he has co-authored three books and is founding editor of the Cambridge University Press series in chemical engineering.
 Varma's research interests are in chemical and catalytic reaction engineering, new energy sources and synthesis of advanced materials.
 He has written more than 265 archival journal research publications in these areas. He earned his bachelor's degree from Panjab University, India, his master's degree from the University of New Brunswick, Canada, and his doctorate from the University of Minnesota.
 In other business, trustees approved a bachelor's degree program in environmental and ecological engineering for the West Lafayette campus, a bachelor's degree program in technical communication at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and a bachelor's degree program in applied computer science at IUPUI.
 No new state funding is being requested for any of the programs and no additional learning resources are necessary. All three programs are scheduled to begin this fall and require approval from the Indiana Commission for Higher Education.
 The goal of the environmental and ecological engineering program is to prepare graduates for employment in those fields or to continue education in an advanced degree program or a related field, Lechtenberg said.
 "A distinguishing feature of the program is the interdisciplinary approach and the contributions from faculty across several disciplines of engineering," Lechtenberg said.
 "Complex modern environmental problems cannot be solved by traditional environmental engineering alone, and require contributions, change in design practices and altered problem-solving approaches across engineering disciplines.
" Lechtenberg said the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts employment in environmental engineering will grow much faster than average, with the addition of almost 17,000 jobs by 2018.
 Growth in employment in the field in Indiana is expected to be equivalent or better than national projections, he said. The technical communication degree is designed to prepare graduates for entry-level technical communications work or graduate work in technical communication or related fields.
 It also is geared toward students who want a double major, pursue work in a technical field relevant to technical communication, and people in mid-career who want to upgrade their skills.
 Technical communication is a growing, dynamic field as technology becomes more complex and specialized, Lechtenberg said. Preparing students for jobs in the computer science and information technology field is the objective of the applied computer science program.
 Lechtenberg said computer science is one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy in Indiana and the nation. In 2008 and 2010, the Indiana Department of Workforce Development listed computer software engineer as the top job on the "Hot 50 Hoosier Job" list, he said.
 Two other IT industry positions requiring a bachelor's degree also were on the list. Trustees also ratified the appointment of Thomas F.
 Brady as dean of the College of Engineering and Technology at Purdue University North Central, Jane F. Mutchler as dean of the School of Management and professor of accounting with tenure at Purdue University Calumet, and Regina Biddings-Muro as interim vice chancellor for advancement at Purdue University Calumet.
 Brady, who is already serving as dean, has been on the faculty at PNC since 1998, most recently as professor of industrial engineering.
 Prior to that he was executive director of the Center for the Management of Manufacturing Enterprises at the Krannert School of Management.
 His teaching and research interests are in industrial engineering and operations research, including computer simulation, optimization and process improvement.
 Mutchler, whose appointment is effective Aug. 1, was most recently associate dean for academic planning and programs at Georgia State University.
 She also was the Ernst & Young-J.W. Holloway Memorial Alumni Professor of Accounting. She had been at Georgia State since 1999, and also served as director of the School of Accountancy.
 Before that she taught at Pennsylvania State University from 1991-1997, the University of Arizona from 1989-1991 and at Ohio State University from 1982-1989.
 She earned her bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of South Florida and her doctorate from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
 Biddings-Muro is executive assistant to the chancellor for engagement at Purdue Calumet. She began working at Purdue Calumet in 2004 after working several years in corporate communications and broadcast journalism.
 In other business, the trustees approved resolutions of appreciation for committees that spearheaded the searches for Purdue's new president and a new chancellor at IPFW.

 Tymora Analytical Operations receives $150,000 NIH grant
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A life-sciences company based in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette has received a grant that could strengthen its technology platform to help biologists and cancer researchers analyze protein samples.
 Tymora Analytical Operations LLC; has received a $150,000 SBIR Phase I grant from the National Institutes of Health. Anton Iliuk, president and chief technology officer, said the award will be used to develop an application for the company's pIMAGO platform.
 The application would allow researchers to detect multiple changes to a protein sample from a single experiment. "Biologists and cancer researchers could use the platform to detect phosphorylation, which is the addition of a phosphate group to a protein, and other changes from a single experiment," he said.
 "By detecting multiple outputs from a single experiment, the application would save time for the researcher and lead to more reliable data.
 It also could be more cost-effective because researchers can screen for modifications without needing to purchase dozens of different materials.
" Iliuk said Tymora Analytical Operations' platforms could be branched out into different applications, and the NIH grant may lead to the first set of products that feature pIMAGO.
 "Another system on the market allows for similar modification detections, but it is radioactivity-based. Institutions and organizations that use it must be certified by the government because of the potential health effects, and thus must be regulated," he said.
 Tymora Analytical Operations has received funding from multiple sources to develop commercialized products, including an SBIR Phase I grant from the National Science Foundation, Purdue's Emerging Innovations Fund and business plan competitions, including the Burton D.
 Morgan Business Plan Competition. Iliuk said the support from these sources and the NIH strengthens the company's outlook. "My colleagues and I believe that if the program directors of the NIH, NSF and other organizations see the value in our potential product, it validates our belief that it has merit and could be useful to researchers in the U.S.
 and around the world," he said. "The funding will keep us moving forward to develop further applications of our technology." Tymora Analytical Operations
 was established in 2010 to provide new nanotechnology-based products to serve the R&D market in the life sciences. Tymora has developed a nanoscale platform technology - with PolyMAC and pIMAGO as the lead products - for unmet needs in analysis of protein phosphorylation that relates to the onset of numerous diseases, most notably cancer.
 The Purdue Research Park, with four locations across Indiana, has the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country.
 The park network is home to about 200 companies that employ 4,000 people and are located in West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Merrillville and New Albany.

 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar will deliver the keynote address on the future of the U.S. energy program next week at the 4th annual 
Collegiate Energy Summit on the Purdue University campus. Lugar, who will leave Congress when his sixth term expires in January, is scheduled to speak at 3:30 p.m.
 Sept. 14 in Stewart Center's Loeb Playhouse. His talk is titled, "Our Nation's Energy Future." A question-and-answer session will follow.
 The event, organized by the Purdue Energy Forum, will include a student research poster session from 10:10-11:40 a.m. in Mann Hall's upper level atrium.
 Workshops focused on energy policy, transportation, architecture, nuclear power and electric cars are scheduled from 12:40-3:30 p.m.
 in Rawls Hall. "Senator Lugar has been an advocate for energy independence for decades," said Anthony Wurl, president of the Purdue Energy Forum and a senior in nuclear engineering at Purdue.
 "This event is designed to engage, motivate and encourage college student leaders and others to focus on America's energy challenges, careers, security and research.
 It also will serve as a terrific networking opportunity for students and other participants." The 4th Collegiate Energy Summit, which is free and open to the public, also will include student information booths of more than 30 companies and organizations at the Burton D.
 Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship in Discovery Park. Tours are planned of Purdue's innovative energy facilities including the Birck Nanotechnology Center and Indiana's only research nuclear reactor on a college campus.
 Hybrid vehicles manufactured by event sponsors will be displayed on the lawn near Mann Hall and the Burton D. Morgan Center in Discovery Park.

"We are excited to build on the past successes of the Collegiate Energy Summit, providing outstanding students in Indiana with the opportunity to interact with leading researchers and industry experts to help to lead America toward a more secure and sustainable energy future," said Lugar, who serves as the Republican leader of the Foreign Relations Committee.
 "Our nation's security and prosperity are tied directly to energy, and Indiana has much to offer in the biofuel and research areas as we partner to chart our course for the future.
" The Purdue Energy Forum, formerly known as the Purdue Energy Club, is a student organization made up of members interested in learning more about, as well as working on, solutions for society's energy challenges.
 The group, with its motto "Education. Collaboration. Innovation," is focused on every aspect of energy generation, transportation, storage or usage.
 "The Purdue Energy Forum emphasizes learning and the principles of energy and energy technology, as well as the new technologies and processes that are being developed today," said Pankaj Sharma, faculty adviser for the Purdue Energy Forum and managing director of the Energy Center.
 "We have reorganized and re-branded the student organization to reflect new broad vision." During his nearly 40 years in Congress, Lugar has championed efforts to reduce this nation's reliance on imported oil.
 Through the Lugar Energy Initiative, he has called for reducing the need for foreign oil by up to 50 percent, saving Americans $33 billion annually.
 A fifth-generation Hoosier, Lugar is the Senate's most senior Republican and the longest serving member of Congress in Indiana history.
 He also is a member and former chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. Lugar was first elected to the U.S.
 Senate in 1976 and won a sixth term in 2006 with 87 percent of the vote, his fourth consecutive victory by a two-thirds majority.

 Undergraduate research program plans symposium
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — The 2012 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program will hold its annual research symposium Wednesday (Aug.1).
 This summer 140 students from engineering, agriculture and science disciplines are participating in SURF. During the symposium, they will present their summer research to professors, graduate students, general public and other program participants.
 The symposium will run from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering. It is free and open to the public. The SURF program, celebrating its 10th anniversary this summer, was started in 2003 by Jay P.
 Gore, Reilly University Chair Professor of Engineering. It provides undergraduate students across engineering, science and technology disciplines with an intensive, interdisciplinary research experience, allowing them to work closely with graduate students and professors and to gain hands-on laboratory experience.
 The interdisciplinary nature of the research at Purdue creates opportunities for undergraduates to work with researchers outside their major.
 During the 2012 program, a third of the participants had that opportunity. Research areas include energy, experimental design, computing and information, communication, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, natural sciences, material science, medicine, public safety, and industrial applications.
 SURF is administered by the College of Engineering and directed by Melba Crawford, associate dean for research in engineering, and Eckhard Groll, interim assistant dean for research in engineering.

 Weather brings out emerald ash borer earlier this year
 An adult emerald ash borer feeds off a leaf. (Purdue University Department of Entomology photo/John Obermeyer) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.
 – The tree-killing emerald ash boreris emerging about a month ahead of schedule in Indiana because of the earlywarm weather, leading a Purdue Extension entomologist to urge homeowners totake steps now to protect their trees.
 Homeowners who want to protect their ash trees withinsecticides need to start applying them as soon as possible, Cliff Sadof said.That is because adult borers typically take flight about the same time thatblack locust trees bloom - a process which has started as a result of favorabletemperatures for both.
 "Black locust bloom has begun to occur in many partsof the state," Sadof said. "Eggs laid by adult borers will producegrubs that start drilling into ash trees in about a month.
" Indiana residents seeking advice should look to the Purduewebsite http://www.eabindiana.info. Resources are available on how to identifyash trees, determine whether trees are infested and how to take care of theproblem themselves or hire a professional applicator.
 * The presence of woodpecker holes, the result ofwoodpeckers feeding on EAB larvae under the bark. * D-shaped holes the borers make when they leave the tree.Because the tee-chewing beetle first attacks treetops, the holes often are toohigh up to see until the tree is nearly dead.
 The exit hole left by an emerald ash borer on a tree is shaped like the letter "D." (Purdue University Department of Entomology photo/ Cliff Sadof)
 The number of ash trees with symptoms in a neighborhoodusually doubles every year. This means that from the time enough trees aredamaged to draw attention to the problem, it takes 3-4 years for all theremaining ash trees to be killed.
 "The cost of keeping communities safe from the limbsthat fall from dying trees can be devastating since over 80 percent of treesdie in the last three years of the local invasion," Sadof said.
 Sadof has posted a cost calculator on the website to helpcommunities plan their response to EAB. Planning is critical to lowering annualexpenses associated with EAB management.
 "Most people are surprised to learn that usinginsecticides to save trees during the initial invasion is much less expensivethan removing and replacing trees," Sadof said.
 "This is because after all the untreated trees havedied, most of the remaining beetles starve to death or are killed when feedingon trees treated with insecticide.
" Annemarie Nagle, exotic forest pest outreach coordinatorfor Purdue's Department of Entomology, is heading a Purdue Extension programcalled Neighbors against Bad Bugs, or NABB, to help neighborhoods work togetherto lower tree management costs.
 "We have been working in communities throughoutIndiana to show people how EAB will affect their neighborhood," saidNagle. "Bringing this issue to the forefront before trees start dying willencourage people to act now so they can save money and save trees.
" Although insecticides are the only tool available forhomeowners, Sadof has been working with the Indiana Department of NaturalResources and the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service for the release of stingless wasps throughout the state tohelp kill the beetle in rural areas.
 The emerald ash borer has killedmillions of ash trees in the U.S. since its arrival in Detroit in 2002. InIndiana, the most extensive damage has been in the northeast, including FortWayne.
 Most of the state north of Interstate 70 or east Indianapolis generallyis infested. When the EAB arrived, Indiana had nearly 150 million ashtrees, at least 5 million in cities.
 In most cities, at least one out of everyfive trees on the streets is an ash tree.

 Weather patterns showing signs of return to normal
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Indiana is seeing a noticeable shift away from hot and dry weather to normal weather patterns for this time of year as frequent rain in recent weeks eases drought conditions.
 The U.S. Drought Monitor update of Thursday (Sept. 13) showed continued improvement, with the west-central portion of the state now in only moderate drought, the first level of dryness.
 Only southern parts of Indiana, generally south of a line from Vincennes to Connersville, remain in the next highest level, severe drought.
 Much of the remainder of the state is in moderate drought, with the northwest abnormally dry. At the height of the drought this summer, most of the state was in the two highest levels of drought - extreme and exceptional.
 But frequent rainfall in August and September are reversing drought conditions. Precipitation this month to date was the result of two major storms - the remnants of Hurricane Isaac at the start of the month and one on Sept.
 7. "A strong cold front last Friday actually produced more rain than Isaac did," said Ken Scheeringa, associate state climatologist.
 September so far has been about two degrees warmer and three times wetter than normal. The central and southern portions of the state have been the wettest.
 While the drought is reversing, its effects will persist for quite a while, said Dev Niyogi, state climatologist. "It's not only about the amount of rain we had," he said.
 "We will likely see impacts on ecosystems, such as regional water supply sources, for the coming months." A compilation of Purdue Extension drought resources is available at

 Webinar to help guide beef producers through the drought
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Navigating the worst drought in decades will be toughest for the livestock sector, but beef producers who do so successfully could find profitable days ahead, a Purdue Extension beef specialist says.
 An Aug. 30 Purdue Extension webinar titled "Beef Strategies to Survive the Drought of 2012 and Prosper" will help producers do just that.
 The free webinar will run 7-9 p.m. "All indicators point to a prosperous future for beef cow-calf producers if they can just find solutions to this year's short forage supply and escalating feed cost," Ron Lemenager said.
 Some of the topics will involve responsible culling to save the most productive cows; early weaning to reduce cow nutrient requirements and dry matter intake; strategies to stretch forage supplies, such as limiting access time to hay; use of traditional, non-traditional and alternative feeds; late-season forage options; strategies for using potentially high nitrate feeds; and value-added marketing.
 Participants with high-speed Internet connections can connect to the webinar via a kiosk at the Purdue Beef website at http://www.thebeefcenter.com/
. The kiosk will be open from noon Aug. 29 until 3 p.m. (EDT) on Aug. 30 to test and confirm that individual computer equipment and Internet service are compatible with the webinar.
 Participants must log on during that time to preregister. Troubleshooting will be available. Those unable to connect from home should contact their local Purdue Extension county offices to arrange a viewing location.

 Webinar to highlight needs of veterans in agriculture
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The National AgrAbility Project and the Military Family Research Institute at Purdue University will present a webinar to help Extension staff and other professionals meet the needs of military veterans in agriculture.
 The webinar, "Veterans in Agriculture: Military 101," will be at 3 p.m. Aug. 30. It will cover topics such as the unique challenges that veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts face, dealing with visible and invisible disabilities, models and programs for injured and disabled veterans in agriculture, and the mission and work of the Military Family Research Institute.
 The speaker will be Martina Mohrbacher, an outreach specialist for MFRI's Operation Diploma initiative. Mohrbacher is responsible for encouraging and assisting two- and four-year higher education institutions in Indiana to help further the educational and career success of student service members and veterans, with a special focus on veterans with disabilities.
 "The webinar's goal is to provide knowledge of veterans' experiences with reintegration for professionals who work with veterans or plan to do so in the future," said Paul Jones, manager of Purdue's Breaking New Ground Resource Center, lead organization in the National AgrAbility Project.
 "The webinar will focus on some of the basic things that professionals would benefit from knowing about military service and the transition back into civilian life.
" He added that while the webinar is especially geared toward those who work in fields such as Extension, the Veterans Administration or nonprofit organizations, it is open to anyone with an interest in veterans' issues.
 The webinar, the first partnership between AgrAbility and MFRI, is one step in a continuing national initiative by AgrAbility to partner with veterans' advocacy organizations in providing services for veterans in agriculture.
 "AgrAbility has been serving veterans since it began in 1991; Breaking New Ground has been doing so for even longer," Jones said.
 "Today, it's not just AgrAbility - other programs around the country are focusing on veterans and agriculture as well." "One veteran told me that he is interested in agriculture because it is primarily mission-focused rather than time-focused - more like the work that he did while he was in the military," Jones said.
 "Other veterans have talked as well about the less stressful, more peaceful atmosphere of their agricultural work." The webinar is free and open to the public.
 Registration is open until Aug. 24, at tinyurl.com/988kgum. Instructions for accessing the webinar will be sent to participants by Aug.

 Webinar to provide health resources for drought-stressed farmers
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Although recent rainfall has eased the strain of drought on much of the Midwest's farmland, the strain on Midwestern farmers remains a major concern, says Paul Jones, Purdue AgrAbility Project manager.
 The Indiana AgrAbility Project at Purdue University will host a free webinar on Sept. 27 to provide support and health resources for farmers.
 "Mental/Behavioral Health Resources for the Drought Aftermath" will begin at 3 p.m. (EDT). "As disappointing harvests become a reality for many, the financial and emotional impacts of the drought may lead some farm families into crisis," Jones said.
 The goal of the session is to give Midwestern farm families and Extension personnel health resources to help them cope with possible effects of the drought.
 "We don't know the extent, but we know the drought will definitely affect farmers and their personal lives," Jones said. "We want to equip people with basic tools and resources so they can point those in trouble in the right direction to receive help.
" The one-hour webinar will provide Extension educators, other agriculture professionals and farm families with resources to address mental or behavioral issues related to the drought.
 * Mental health issues likely to be encountered by drought-stressed farmers, such as depression, anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts and actions and substance abuse.
 Roberta Schweitzer, a former assistant professor in the Purdue School of Nursing, will lead the presentation. She collaborates with the Indiana AgrAbility/Breaking New Ground programs to explore rural stress and coping issues and to enhance mental health resources and well-being in farm families living with a chronic disability.
 She has more than 20 years of professional experience in psychotherapy and counseling with individuals, families and groups and is a nationally certified trainer for Mental Health First Aid.
 To register, visit www.tinyurl.com/drought-webinar by Sept. 21. Instructions for accessing the webinar will be sent to registrants by Sept.

 What to expect of weather for Super Bowl week? Look at history
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The state climatologist has some insight on the weather that visitors to Indianapolis might expect during a week of activities leading up to the Super Bowl on Feb.
 5.The Indiana State Climate Office, based at Purdue University, has prepared a website of historical weather statistics for Indianapolis from Jan.
 30 to Feb. 5 going back to 1943, the earliest year for which data were available. The site, called "Super Five of February 5," is at http://iclimate.org/centralindiana.asp
The site is named "Super Five" because it includes the five years that had the most extreme weather on Feb. 5. The warmest high temperature on that date was 65 degrees Fahrenheit in 2008; the lowest cold temperature was minus-16 degrees in 1979.
Using the last 10 years of weather data as a benchmark, those walking the downtown streets from event to event could expect a daily high temperature of about 39 degrees and a nighttime low near 22, according to the office's analysis of the statistics.
Snowfall the past 10 years during that week in Indianapolis has ranged from zero to 5.3 inches, with an average of 2.1 inches. The most snow cover was 8.3 inches in 2009, but about 1.8 inches of snow on the ground is normal for the week.
The temperature and precipitation won't matter much to the fans once they arrive at Lucas Oil Stadium to see the game between the New York Giants and the New England Patriots.
 It will be played indoors, where the forecast is for short-sleeve temperatures and dry conditions, except for the moment when the tub of icy Gatorade is dumped on the winning coach.

 Wild native shrub suitable for home landscape plantings
 Spiraea alba (at top) and Spiraea tomentosa, two species related to a popular landscaping plant, could offer new options for gardeners.
Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Hoping for an alternative to the common landscaping plant Japanese Spirea, Purdue University scientist Mike Mickelbart found that it's possible to bring the plant's native cousins into backyards.
 Mickelbart, an associate professor of horticulture, has filled his yard with native plant species. Spiraea japonica, a shrub also known as Japanese Spirea that typically has pink flowers, is one of the most common landscape native species available at nurseries, but Mickelbart has never been attracted to it.
 "Planting natives in my backyard is a fun way to learn about the native flora," Mickelbart said. "I see a lot of Spiraea japonica
 and day lilies. But I would like to see the palette of native plants available for landscape use expand." Spiraea alba, a shrub with white flowers, and 
Spiraea tomentosa, a shrub with pink flowers, are native to much of the Midwest and Northeast in the United States. But the acidic soils the shrubs are used to in their wild habitats were seen as limiting factors in adapting the plants to urban Midwestern landscapes, which typically have neutral to alkaline soils.
 Mickelbart grew the plants over two years in a range of soil pH levels - from the acidic soil the plants are used to in the wild, to a neutral soil common in home flower beds.
 The neutral soil pH levels resulted in slightly smaller plants than would be found in natural settings, but leaf greenness and leaf size were unaffected.
 "These are underutilized native plants," said Mickelbart, whose findings were reported in the July issue of the journal HortScience
. "This shows that they could be incorporated into our landscaping. They might be a little smaller, but they should do just fine.
" The drawback, Mickelbart said, is that local nurseries don't currently carry Spiraea alba and Spiraea tomentosa. He said that anyone interested should look to online seed or plant dealers, or ask a local nursery if they can obtain plants.
 "These plants are not out there yet, but if demand grows, nurseries might start carrying them," Mickelbart said. Wildtype Nursery, Possibility Place Nursery and Greendell Mulch donated materials, and the Indiana Nursery and Landscape Association partially funded the research.
 ABSTRACT Soil pH Effects on Growth and Foliar Nutrient Concentrations of Spiraea alba Du Roi and Spiraea tomentosa L. The North American native plants Spiraea alba and S.
 tomentosa have potential as landscape plants because they are small- to medium-sized shrubs with showy flowers that persist from early to late summer.
 However, the cultural requirements of these species are not well documented. Both species grow in slightly acidic soils in their native habitats.
 The objective of this work was to determine if the growth and/or appearance of these shrubs is affected by the neutral to slightly alkaline soils common throughout the Midwest.
 Spiraea alba grown from three seed sources and S. tomentosa grown from a single seed source were grown for 2 years in soils of different pH.
 Elemental sulfur (S) was incorporated into a Drummer silty clay loam with a pH of 7.2 to bring the pH to 5.8 and 6.4 2 years after incorporation, thus establishing plots with three pH levels for assessing growth and appearance.
 The soil pH increased to 6.4 and 6.8 in the amended plots between Years 2 and 3 after S incorporation. Soil concentrations of exchangeable magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) were lowered with added S.
 Height and width varied among S. alba from different seed sources, and height and width of all plants were reduced when grown at the highest soil pH.
 Leaf greenness, specific leaf weight, and individual leaf area were unaffected by pH. Leaf concentrations of nitrogen, potassium, zinc, and manganese were higher in lower soil pH, whereas Mg was lowest at the lowest soil pH.
 These results suggest that S. alba and S. tomentosa can be grown in neutral pH soils without an effect on plant appearance, but plant size will be less than at pH levels closer to the native soils for these species.
 Although some micronutrients were present at lower concentrations at the neutral pH, leaf greenness was unaffected, again suggesting that these plants may perform suitably outside of their native habitat pH range.

 Wisconsin-Stout repeats as Rube Goldberg winner
 Jennifer George, Rube Goldberg's granddaughter, talks with members of Purdue's Society Professional Engineers and Society of Professional Hispanic Engineers team.
 The Purdue team is claiming a world record with a machine that has 232 steps.Download Photo WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Defending champion University of Wisconsin-Stout won the 24th annual Rube Goldberg Machine Contest on Saturday (March 26) at Purdue University.
 Immediately after Saturday's competition, a machine built by a Purdue team completed a flawless run of 232 steps, surpassing the world record of 230 steps held by Ferris State University.
 Purdue's Society of Professional Engineers/Society of Hispanic Engineers team will submit a video of the run to Guinness World Records for certification.
 The machine follows the history of the world from the big bang to the present. Saturday's competition was only the second time Wisconsin-Stout has competed.
 Its machine told the story of a deserted Louisiana estate whose dead residents come to life with the full moon. The Rube Goldberg competition, sponsored by Phi Chapter of Theta Tau fraternity, rewards machines that most effectively combine creativity with inefficiency and complexity.
 Machines must use at least 20 steps to complete the task in no more than two minutes. Teams have three tries to complete two runs.
 Points are deducted if students have to assist the machine once it has started. The Wisconsin-Stout machine had 135 steps. The team completed one perfect run with no interventions and one run with one intervention.
 Andrew Behnke, captain of the University of Wisconsin-Stout team, explains the workings of the team's winning Rube Goldberg machine.
Download Photo Captain Andrew Behnke of Loyal, Wis., said the team, composed mostly of education and business majors, developed a storyline that drove the steps for the handcrafted machine.
 Pennsylvania State University took second place with a Penn State-themed machine that included a football stadium and legendary coach Joe Paterno.
 The University of Texas was third. Its machine traced the cycle of water. Other teams competing were from St. Olaf College of Northfield, Minn.; Ferris State University of Big Rapids, Mich.; University of Illinois; Washington State Community College; Virginia Commonwealth University; Genesee Community College of Batavia, N.Y.; and Texas A&M University.
 On display during the contest was the machine from New Auburn, Wis., which won the national Rube Goldberg High School Competition on March 19 at Ferris State University.
 New Auburn has just 350 students in grades K-12 but has won the national high school contest three times. Its machine had a Toy Story theme.
 Jennifer George, Rube Goldberg's granddaughter and legacy director of Rube Goldberg Inc., attended Saturday's competition. "I'm thrilled to be here.
 It's incredibly exciting," she told the audience. "I know my grandfather is here in spirit." It also was announced that Rube Goldberg Inc.
 will begin a virtual online machine contest for middle school students next school year. Details on that and other Rube Goldberg contests and activities can be found at 
http://www.rubegoldberg.com Sponsors for this year's competition were BAE Systems, Omega Engineering, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins, Alcoa, Priio and Ethicon Endo-Surgery.
 Rube Goldberg specialized in drawing whimsical machines with complex mechanisms to perform simple tasks. He earned a degree in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1904.
 He worked as an engineer for the city of San Francisco for less than a year before becoming a sports cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle.
 He received a Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for his political cartoons published by the New York Sun. The Rube Goldberg Machine Contest dates back to 1949 when it began as a competition between two Purdue fraternities.
 It was held until 1955, then revived in 1983 and opened to all Purdue students. The first national contest was held in 1988. Note to Journalists

 INDIANAPOLIS - Purdue Extension showed its appreciation to two farm women for their leadership and achievements by honoring them with its 
Women in Agriculture awards. The annual awards, presented Wednesday (Aug. 15) at the Indiana State Fair, recognize women who make a positive contribution to Indiana agriculture.
 "We look for nominees who have gone above and beyond in their dedication to Indiana agriculture," said Christa Holloway, a health and human sciences Extension educator in Fulton County and an organizer of the awards program.
 "We look at the positive impacts they've had on the industry, community and personal lives, their potential for future success, and their passion for agriculture.
 We certainly found those qualities in the recipients." The Leadership Award, given to a woman in an agribusiness or policymaking position, was presented to LuAnn Troxel, co-owner of Troxel Dairy Farm in LaPorte and Starke counties.
 She and her husband, Tom, also operate an animal veterinary business, South County Veterinary Service, of which LuAnn Troxel is office manager, and own the Heifer Hill neonatal heifer-raising facility, where they raise about 200 head of calves until 6 months of age.
 Troxel has been president of the Indiana Professional Dairy Producers since 2009. Under her leadership, the group developed a website (
http://www.IndianaDairy.org), hired the organization's first executive director, developed leadership and organizational strategies, increased support levels by 500 percent, and increased dairy farmer membership.
 Her leadership has involved participating in AgrIInstitute's Indiana Agricultural Leadership program and being a leadership team member of the American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology.
 She was president of the LaPorte County Purdue Extension Board in 2008-09 and still serves on the board. She is chair of the Ways and Means Committee of the Porter County Master Gardeners Association and is an Advanced Master Gardener.
 Her work has included being woman's leader of the Cass-Dewey Township Farm Bureau, assistant secretary of the LaPorte County Farm Bureau and a member of the Indiana Farm Bureau State Dairy Advisory Committee.
 The Achievement Award, recognizing women who are directly involved in a home farming operation, was presented to Tammi Unger, who has been a full partner and co-owner of Del Unger Farms in Carlisle since 1984.
 Since then, the operation has grown from 1,200 acres to 4,500 acres. While Del Unger Farms is the grain operation, Unger Farms, formed in 1990, is the entity that encompasses the 75-head beef cattle operation.
 The Ungers have worked to include their children in the family farm operations, creating Unger Farms Precision with their daughter, Adair, in 2008, and Unger Farms Grain with their son, Lance, in 2011.
 Tammi Unger has been the driving force in positioning Unger Farms to bring the next generation into the farming operation. She is secretary-treasurer of each entity and an equal partner with her husband in all decisions.
 With a degree in agriculture economics from Purdue University, she uses the latest technology to manage Unger Farms. Among her activities, Tammi Unger is involved in Sullivan County 4-H program and has served on the Sullivan County Extension Board.
 She was a presenter for Annie's Project in Sullivan County, sharing her recordkeeping knowledge with the participants. She also took the lead in coordinating efforts for the first stop of the 2011 Farm Management Tour, which was at Unger Farms.

 Workshop at Prophetstown to cover horse feed management
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Farmers and horse owners interested in building their horses' feed programs around hay and other forages can learn about good forage and feed management practices at the Purdue Extension Hay Day at Prophetstown Farm.
 The workshop will be July 28 from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the farm at 3549 Prophetstown Trail in Battle Ground, near West Lafayette.
 Morning and afternoon sessions will be set up as stations that participants can attend according to their needs and interests, with session topics including soil assessment, seeding and harvesting methods and equipment, nutritional analysis of hay, and basing a feeding program on quality forage.
 Session speakers will include Keith Johnson, Purdue Extension forage specialist, and Mark Russell, Purdue Extension equine specialist.
 There will be a teaching session during the lunch hour. In the afternoon, participants will have the chance to drive different types of horse-drawn haymaking equipment.
 "We want people who use hay, want hay, sell hay, make hay," said Dris Abraham, chief operating officer of Historic Prophetstown and owner of RX Acres Belgians.
 "Hay is critical for the small farmer with the grain market the way it is, and we want to help the small farmer to increase his forage and diversify - not just horse owners, either, but small cattle farmers, owners of 4-H animals, anyone who uses hay.
" "By learning about the way we do our hay and the processes we use, they will be able to continue farming and raising their animals in this rough economy", he said.
 "We can't lose the farmer - we can't lose the horse owner. We've got to help people get back on their feet." Participants can download the workshop registration form from the Prophetstown website at 
http://www.prophetstown.org/registration%20form.pdf. The fee for attending the workshop is $40 and includes lunch. For more information, contact Abraham at

 Workshop to aid landowners in wildlife management
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue Extension and the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife are offering a workshop in Fort Wayne for landowners interested in managing their properties for wildlife.
 The eight-week course, "Wildlife Management for the Private Landowner," will introduce landowners to wildlife biology, identification and habitat management planning.
 Participants also will learn how to access information and get assistance in managing wildlife on their properties. Because most land in Indiana is privately owned, private landowners are the critical force for successful wildlife management programs, Extension wildlife specialist Rob Chapman said.
 "We want to provide the Indiana citizens interested in managing wildlife resources on their land with the knowledge to prepare a wildlife management plan and an understanding of the tools, financial requirements, and sweat equity it will take to realize their goals," he said.
 The workshop will be held from 6-9 p.m. every Tuesday beginning Sept. 18 and ending Nov. 6 on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne.
 Saturday field days are planned for Oct. 13 and Oct. 27. The course will cover management techniques for forests, grasslands, wetlands and fishing ponds.
 Other topics include the biology and management of white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, pheasants, quail, rabbits and doves. Experts from Purdue University, Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife, U.S.
 Fish and Wildlife Service and National Wild Turkey Federation will provide instruction. Registration is $100 per person and includes a binder with resource materials and publications.
 Refreshments will be provided during each session. A family discount is available, with the first attendee paying the full fee and each additional family member paying a reduced fee of $30.
 To register or request more information about the course, contact Purdue Extension wildlife specialist Rob Chapman at 812-662-4999 or at

 Wounded vet, actor to keynote Krannert event
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — J.R. Martinez, a wounded Iraq War veteran and actor, will give the keynote address Oct. 11 at the Purdue University Krannert School of Management's 12th annual Leadership Speakers Series.
 Martinez, who was crowned "Dancing with the Stars" champion in 2011, is a sought-after motivational speaker whose message is about resilience, optimism and making the most of every situation.
 Tickets for the dinner are available to the general public for $100 per person, $75 of which qualifies as a charitable deduction.
 Net proceeds from the event go to Krannert undergraduate and graduate scholarships. Specially priced tickets are available for Purdue students, faculty and staff.
 Martinez, 29, was born in Shreveport, La. He also lived in Hope, Ark., and Dalton, Ga., where he graduated from high school. He joined the U.S.
 Army in 2002 and was sent to Iraq in 2003. Less than a month into his deployment, a Humvee he was driving hit a land mine. Three other soldiers with him were ejected, but Martinez was trapped inside.
 He suffered smoke inhalation and burns over more than 40 percent of his body. Martinez spent 34 months recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, where he underwent 33 surgeries.
 He traces his interest in motivational speaking to the time a nurse at Brooke asked him to speak to another burn patient who had become withdrawn.
 After 45 minutes, that patient finally opened up to Martinez. Martinez also has been an actor, playing an injured Iraq War veteran on ABC TV's "All My Children.
" The part, originally planned for a three-month arc, lasted for three years. He became a fan favorite on the 13th season of ABC's "Dancing with the Stars.
" He and his partner, Karina Smirnoff, won the competition. Martinez graduated from the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities in 2008 through Florida State University.
 Purdue is one of eight U.S. universities participating in EBV, which was created at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management in 2007 to teach participants principles of entrepreneurship and small-business management.
 Martinez was named the 2012 disabled veteran of the year by the Disabled American Veterans organization. Several awards will be presented during the Krannert event, which begins at 6:30 p.m.
 in the Purdue Memorial Union ballrooms. Those awards are the Krannert Business Leadership Award, Krannert Distinguished Alumni Award, Krannert Distinguished Service Award, John S.
 Day Distinguished Alumni Academic Service Award and Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship Award. Purdue Acting President Timothy Sands and Krannert Dean Chris Earley also will speak.
 To reserve tickets for the dinner, contact Melissa Evens, Krannert associate director of special events and EBV, at 765-494-4392, 
mevens@purdue.edu. More information about the Leadership Series and this year's event is available at http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/events/LSS/
 Note to Journalists: Media interested in covering the event should contact Tim Newton, Krannert director of external relations, at 765-496-7271, 
tnewton@purdue.edu. Videotaping and audio recording of the event will not be permitted.

 Youth with disabilities invited to participate in Purdue swim, sports program
 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Children with physical, cognitive and emotional disabilities can participate in a five-week physical activity and aquatics program that begins in October through Purdue University.
 PETE's PALS, which stands for Physical Education Teacher Educators Supporting Physical Activity, Learning, and Service, pairs children ages 3-18 with a university student clinician to work individually on physical fitness, swimming and water safety skills.
 Each child's program is designed to fit his or her needs but can include physical fitness activities to improve muscular strength, endurance and flexibility; body awareness and special orientation; or fundamental and motor-patterns and sport skills.
 PETE's PALS is based in the Department of Health and Kinesiology. "All children with disabilities are welcome, and we have children with physical, cognitive and emotional disabilities that range from mild to severe," said K.
